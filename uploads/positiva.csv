1;"I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.
1;"""My husband is a Twizzlers addict.  We've bought these many times from Amazon because we're government employees living overseas and can't get them in the country we are assigned to.  They've always been fresh and tasty"
1;"""For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store!  I love McCann's instant oatmeal - all flavors!!!<br /><br />Thanks"
1;We really like the McCann's steel cut oats but find we don't cook it up too often.<br />This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient.<br />Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing.
1;Good oatmeal.  I like the apple cinnamon the best.  Though I wouldn't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste.  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of.
1;This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride.<br />I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation.<br />I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line.
1;"""For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.<br /><br />Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The  zero carb  sports drinks didn't help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!<br /><br />I've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.<br /><br />These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work....."""
1;"""Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I'm lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick"
1;"""I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting. It arrived fresh and intact. Very good size. I froze half for later use. I am a pastry lover and these were the best I've ever tasted. The pastry was soft"
1;These taste really good. I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture. I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. Order in cold weather and buy enough to last!!!
1;My shepherd/collie mix has IBS.  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food.  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it.  I will always buy it from Amazon...it's $10 cheaper and free shipping!
1;Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell. She has awful food allergy's and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didn't have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to. She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.. she seems to like that better. We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it. If your dog has allergy's or stomach issue.. or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it! You will see a difference in your pet.
1;I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.
1;"""My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. He's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods"
1;"""My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3.  The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him (Iams Lamb and Rice) and onto a new kind.  This was the second one we tried"
1;I like Creme Brulee. I loved that these were so easy. Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil. They look amazing and taste great. My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes. I will be ordering more!
1;I have been drinking this tea for a long time now.  I used to have to purchase it at a doctor's office because it wasn't available elsewhere.  I'm so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon.com.  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee.  Wonderful taste.
1;"""I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion"
1;"""In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy. This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or mid-day snack. They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then. They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy. It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon!<br /><br />Note: it is great to open a bag"
1;"""I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his  spunk  so I decided it was time to start buying him  real  cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices"
1;This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.
1;"""I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food"
1;Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book!
1;I really loved the spicy flavor these had.  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite.  If you aren't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough.
1;AWESOME!!! such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you. I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful.
1;"""I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here. This jello is wonderful! Evidently it's only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall"
1;This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year-round. It has a powerful flavor and you don't need much of it to zest up a dish. I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day.<br /><br />I will buy this product again and again.
1;"""We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic!  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn't discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture"
1;These little guys are tasty and refreshing.<br /><br />I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath.  I eat 2 of these after lunch (because they are so small) and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem.<br /><br />They're sugar free (sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow) which is great and they're tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch.<br /><br />This is a good bulk value buy and I'd highly recommend the mints themselves.  Cheers!
1;These little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great deal.There perfict for on the go.Fifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary along.And there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugar.The price of twelve dollars was very resonable.Also there great for shareing.If you are looking for a mint try these ones.Youll be glad you did.
1;"""A friend who'd been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago. Even took me over to the store and bought me a pound. At $7/lb. in a retail store or a little over $9 with shipping from an online merchant"
1;"""I'm trying several of the Wu Yi teas. I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste. It also has a natural sweetness.<br /><br />The ingredients include Organic Wu-Li Cliff Oolong Tea (700 mg)"
1;"""This is the ultimate puppy food.  The kibbles are great for small breeds.  High in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use.  Less waste results from the high quality ingredients.  I have been hunting"
1;"""A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />In the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.<br /><br />I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away. The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally).<br /><br />This is a great tasting tea"
1;"""Had this shipped to my sister who follows a gluten-free eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets. Also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs.  Stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking"
1;"""Love this sugar. It tastes so much better and isn't as overly sweet tasting as  regular  sugar. We've used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good. The price that Amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff."""
1;"""So many  healthy  products don't taste very good.  Or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill.  I've had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty.  I've served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them. It's also nice to have something gluten-free for friends who are borderline diabetic...but I would eat them anyway."""
1;"""I had tried both of the Guayaki energy shots and I don't like the taste of either of them! This one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better. I like them cold for sure. My husband and I take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we don't have to make stops for coffee! Especially on the turnpikes where it's just way too expensive. It's worth the $[...] per shot. We normally split them. I'm really sensitive to caffeine"
1;"""I tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck.  So I decided to try good ole Amazon.com and selected this product.  It is so good..add a few herbs and it's a great side dish"
1;"""I love this coffee. I do wish it came already ground as I don't have a grinder and use a blender instead. But it's worth it. Many flavored coffees I've tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesn't reach the coffee"
1;"""This brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time -- I've believe the company is local.  I've been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it.  I'm particularly fond of the Turtle Sundae but all the flavors are good.  I can't say that I've had a bad one.<br /><br />As it turns out"
1;I ordered these for my coffee themed wedding. When they arrived I had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good. I literally had to hide the box to the wedding! They were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables. It was a great tasting product for the lowest price I've seen!
1;" ""These are delicious! The chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose. Crunchy and not bitter. <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067AD4U >Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans 5 Pounds</a>"""
1;"""These chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful!  The chocolate is very dark and rich and the  bean  inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing."""
1;"""Go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of Weaver's Peru Organic Whole Bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee.  And when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they don't know better"
1;"""Green Mountain  Nantucket Blend  K-Cups make a very good cup of coffee in my <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA >Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a>. This is a very smooth tasting brew that my wife prefers over the <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK >Coffee People"
1;The tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor.  It is clean and really fresh!  Perfect on an avocado chicken sandwich.<br /><br />The spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup I have ever tried.  It is so good I have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy!
1;Before I discover this mix on Amazon I always bought it in Whole Food Store.<br />I like this mix and when I am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffy.<br />Just one small secret: Try to add the Seltzer water instead of regular one.
1;"""This is a simple product and it is simply good.  There are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are.  It is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup"
1;It's always a pleasure to find French's products on the web.  All of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but McCormacks bland and tasteless seasonings.<br /><br />This is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find.
1;Whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie! The only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast. Hope these don't go the way of the dinosaur!
1;Tried many varieties of BBQ chips and hands down these are the BEST on the market! These R not too salty or greasy. Great crispy crunch. Plenty of good BBQ flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of. Every bag (after bag) is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st!!
1;"""I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own"
1;These are some of the best chips that I have ever had... They sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands. They are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time! These will be the only chips that I buy from now on and I thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time!
1;These chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school. They are by far the tastiest chips I've had and it's impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag!
1;"""These chips are some of the best I've tasted. They are not filled with chemicals. You taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato. Not greasy. Perfectly crispy. If you don't like salt and vinegar tanginess"
1;For some reason Amazon would not ship these to Alaska!..so I sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them.  They are very good chips! Amazon should rethink the shipping to Alaska thing.  I would order groceries online.
1;We love Kettle Chips Lightly Salted and don't feel guilty eating them!  We used to buy them at Whole Foods but buying from Amazon has saved us money.  We have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery.
1;"""These are a favorite at our home. We like the ones that have Sea Salt. We also like Barbeque  flavored. These are not ruffly chips that have ridges. These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes. They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth. They also have a great taste. The sea salt ones"
1;Great price for an excellent chip. At about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip. Everyone I've let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste. I've yet to find a Kettle chip that disappointed!
1;"""Kettle brand chips are very crunchy.  I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the  soft  end of the  soft/crunchy  spectrum.  Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest"
1;"""Someone brought these to a party we had last month and I didn't put them out because the buffet was full and didn't think anyone would like saltless potato chips.  Last week we had some friends over and these were all I had in the pantry so I put them out.  OH MY GOSH THEY ARE SO GOOD!  I was so wrong to think they would be bland"
1;These Backyard BBQ Kettle Chips were a great deal with the promo code.  It was nice to have a larger size bag.  Some Kettle Chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch!  They arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from Amazon Grocery have been.  Great flavor and All Natural!
1;I am glad I was able to find these on this site. I love this flavor and they are so crunchy. The box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs. Most of the bags survived in tact.
1;I have never been addicted to anything in my life...until I tasted these chips.  I have tried other brands of the sea salt and vinegar flavor and they are just not the same.  You've got to stick with this blue bag of chips!
1;If you're looking at this you probably already know you like these chips.<br />This is a great deal and I have not had any problems with them going stale.<br />The 1oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid over-eating.
1;Salt & vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so I think I've tried every brand out there.  These are by far the best.  I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy.  They seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste.
1;"""This is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them. We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags. The Kettle chips were in a 2oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal. The chips are so delicious"
1;But you will enjoy ever step. I gained 5 lbs within a month of buying this 12 pack of full sized bags. Damn it! They should warn you about this! Tastes awesome though. When I finish my crash diet I will order another box (case?). :-)
1;"""I've eaten other brands of unsalted potato chips and they've always been terrible.  I didn't expect much when I bought these.  But after I tasted them I was amazed.  I have never enjoyed unsalted potato chips before these.  They have a natural potato flavor with thick"
1;I knew my family already liked these chips so it was a no brainer to take advantage of a great price for good chips.  The price per bag can't be beat if you order with subscribe and save and the good thing is you can always change the delivery interval if you notice you go through them quicker or slower than you anticipated.
1;The tea tin is guarding the aroma very well.<br />The taste is beautiful: the Malva flowers do soften the taste and the amount of bergamot is just right.<br />The first time I used too much tea and soaked it for too long (I used as reference Darjeeling FTGFOP First Flush).<br />Since then I save on the quantity of tea leaves and soak the tea for only two minutes.<br />A delight: the best Earl Grey I ever had. The price is very competitive.
1;"""My male Maltese dog had been enjoying the Old Roy's Puppy Biscuits from Walmart.  Then I couldn't find them.  I was desperate to find a treat that would measure up.  I ordered six bags of the peanut butter and crossed my fingers.<br /><br />They arrived"
1;"""I am on a low glycemic index diet to help control my blood sugar and hormone levels. My nutritionist recommended agave nectar as a sweetener since it's GI index is in the low 30's as opposed to honey in the low 50's and sugar in the mid-50's. I've tried supermarkets"
1;"""I was out to dinner with friends & family at  The Saloon  in  Rte 46 Entertainment Complex  in Sanford FL. Besides having an awesome staff (ask for Keith) and fabulous food (the escargot is a MUST) they serve China Mist tea. This is the 1st time I chose the Tropical Organic Green -- I have no doubt it is the best flavored tea I have ever had."""
1;"""The first time I ate these chips was in Aruba in 2007.  I couldn't find them in our area (CT) so you can imagine my joy when I found them on Amazon.  I love these and hope you continue to carry them.  Your prices are terrific too.  I pay $2.99 in Aruba and they run about $2.46 a bag when I buy the case of 12 through Amazon.  Good job!!!!  Only problem is"
1;We like these chips for salsa and quacomole better than any other cips on the market. They are even great by themselves. We will order these as long as they are available. Thank you for making them accessable.<br /><br />  Shelly Kenyon
1;"""Plocky's chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness.  They are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips.  The flavor out performs any tortilla chip I have ever eaten.  They hold up great to salsas and dips.  Nothing wimpy about them.  I just wish the company made a bigger bag!  Love them.  Usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery"
1;I work in college Financial Aid and keep a bowl of these on my desk for the students.  I used to buy them in the grocery store then learned I could get them for less online ($17 for 3lb bag) and thought that was a good deal - until I found this GREAT deal!

1;"""My bottle arrived just in time for a sushi dinner and game night planned with friends.  I had three soy sauces to choose from.  After some sampling we were all using the Bluegrass!  Everyone enjoyed the light smoothness a subtle sweetness.  We were splashing right on every piece"
1;I recently acquired a bottle of this and was immediately impressed.  It has good flavor without all the excessive saltiness of supermarket brands.  I've used it for marinades and dipping sauces in addition to straight use and in all cases it has added a little something extra.  Quite a surprise to find an American made soy sauce that tastes this good!
1;"""We've tried many Tassimo flavors.  This is by far our favorite.  Our normal cup of coffee is Starbuck's house blend out of a Cuisinart pot but one or two days a week we use our Tassimo.  This coffee is rich but not too stong.  I don't understand the current price over $20 for 14 disks and hope that it will be lowered on Amazon.  For now"
1;"""This is the best caramel/chocolate combination I have ever tasted. The caramel is liquid and complements the Ghiradelli chocolate perfectly. Do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight - you will end up an addict like me.<br />  The Ghiradelli product is far better than the Caramello/Hershey product in every way. The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares"
1;Purchased this as a gift for my mother when it was a lightning deal.  She was very happy and loved the basket.  She enjoyed the cookies and the flavors of tea that were included.  Shipped quick and arrived when expected.
1;"""These small chocolate cups are a specialty party item that I have never been able to find in the past when I wanted them.  Amazon now provides a link.  They can be used for what are commonly called  jello shots"
1;This is food especially designed for Cocker spaniels who have a range of health issues...I have been using this product with three of my dogs and all of them are very happy with it. It also is packaged very well and as a result stays fresh for a long period of time. Great product!
1;"""I tired many different dog foods over the 3 yrs I have my cocker spaniel. I then came upon this breed specific dog food & figured I'd try it. My dog loves this food and always finishes his food. I've used this for over 1 yr now & he has not tired of it. I have seen a significant change (for the better) in him"
1;Honeyville Rolled Oats is a delicious product.  I am using them to make a product designed to increase and enrich the milk production in lactating mothers.<br />The oats were shipped to me in a timely fashion and the amazing thing is I only paid $4.99 shipping for 50lbs of oats!  I encourage anyone who likes oats to order Honeyville Rolled Oats.  Their flavor is above all the rest.
1;This tea has surpassed all other breakfast teas in this tea-drinking household. We love it and it really starts the morning off right. Perhaps it has more caffeine than our old favorites?? The taste is wonderful without any additions and it will remain our tea of choice in the morning and often throughout the day.
1;"""It always amazes me that there are not dozens of reviews here extolling the fine qualities of this tea.  I have drunk it pretty much every day for the last five years and I never get tired of it.  It's an excellent morning tea"
1;I hardly ever write reviews but this tea is quite excellent.  I decided to try it without any sweetener or any other added taste enhancers.  It is flavorful without being overpowering.  It is a great pleasure to have a fine tea like this loose and reasonably priced.  After the first try I have continued to drink it just as it comes.  You can see by the leaves once they are soaked that it is a premium tea.
1;"""This baking soda works great for cooking or for health reasons.  I take it for acid indigestion and heart burn.  Just a 1 tsp in a half glass of water and it's gone.  I use it to make my body more alkaline"
1;"""I bought these back in January and never got around to reviewing them. I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out. Just like the description states"
1;"""I had bought Pocky when on vacation and enjoyed it but living where there are no Asian stores I have to shop on the internet. The guys in the family seem to like it better than the ladies for some reason. For a bit of insanity"
1;Great taste. Great ingredients. Great texture. Absolutely delicious! They are a little smaller and you may still be hungry if it is for a meal. I give one to my 5 year old son for breakfast and he is still a little hungry for more. Either that or they taste so good he wants more.
1;This is the best coffee we've ever had.  I run The American Pavilion in Cannes and Weaver's was by far and  away our most popular coffee sponsor!  Hundreds of people come to The Pavilion every day looking for American coffee and they were not disappointed.  We did a booming business this year!  Buy it!  You'll be so happy you did!  Julie
1;My son loves the rice and lentil jars.  It's not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice jars.  I have it on order with subscribe and save + amazon mom and it always arrives nicely packaged.
1;The Rice and Lentil dinner is our son's absolute favorite. I don't know why but he gobbles this up every time. He enjoys most of the Earth's Best foods and we have only found a couple he doesn't eat (anything with too much apple) which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination. Some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar.
1;"""This tastes so good that apparently our cat thinks so too -- he's constantly poking his furry face around every time we pop open one of these. There is absolutely nothing bad to say about these. I know some people have complained about the poor packaging but I believe that must've been fixed b/c I've not had any problems at all -- in fact"
1;My son loves the Best Earth's baby food and his favorite seems to be the Vegetable and Turkey. He smiles at every mouthful.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for healthy feeding the organic way. All the food I feed my son is through Earth's Best.
1;As a child my facorite memory was drinking Sassafras tea made from fresh sassafras with my Granddad. I have never seen it in a tea bag before. I found that to get the taste I remember I needed 2 bags per cup. The bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that I will buy again and again. Plus the shipping time was great.
1;I heard some great things about Sassafras and wanted to try it.  I was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated.  I'm actually gonna order the 4-pack and continue drinking it over time.  Don't trust the FDA!!
1;Nothing easier. Nothing better. Even beats grandmother's white gravy recipe. Already peppered for you. You do nothing but mix it with water. Takes only a minute or two. I highly recommend this gravy mix. It will not disappoint.
1;"""I am a coffee fanatic but have always stayed away from these because I never liked instant coffee and my assumption was that this would be similar.  I really enjoy the Starbucks VIA instant coffee - but I drink so much"
1;"""My primary point with this review is to note that this packaging is less expensive than the other size offered by Folger. You get more coffee for less money.<br /><br />  I recently started drinking coffee again after a lapse of many years. Since I didn't know how many cups a day I would use"
1;"""I gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit. And I'm glad I did. It has a somewhat sweet and almost minty taste and a wonderful aroma. It has a nice reddish color. This tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green matcha tea I've had"
1;"""I previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price.  I decided to give Pure Matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive.  The quality of Pure Matcha's products surpasses that of all others I have tried- stays fresh"
1;This is my favorite hot sauce! I liketo use it to give anything some extra flavor. I have loved going out to some of my favorite resturants in town and seeing that they are offering this great product.I really enjoy putting on my my breakfast burritos!
1;This is my favorite hot sauce. I buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have. Hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy! My favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far. Thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce!
1;So far I have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing. My fiance and I use them nearly daily and I just picked up 3 more. It goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kick.<br /><br />The sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears. It is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use. We love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice.
1;I have a whole box of peanut butter dog cookies and she wont touch them. She loves these and begs for them so it was a good buy. She is a little chihuhua and they are not too big for her mouth. About 20 per box.
1;"""This cereal is difficult to find in the stores so I appreciate being able to purchase it through Amazon.  My husband really likes it and looks forward to the delivering of it every month.  Seems like an unlikely thing to look forward to"
1;The Kellogg Mueslix Cereal was ordered one evening and just a couple of days later it arrived. The item was well packed. Contents were fresh. Encountered no problems<br />and plan to use this resource again.
1;"""If you like Shortbread you will really like these. Walkers always makes the best Shortbread.<br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCVLXG >Walkers Shortbread Highlander Shortbread Portion Pack"
1;We love these sugar cubes in the office.  They aren't your grandmother's sugar cube.  They have a rugged appearance (can sugar cubes be considered rugged).  And we combine them with the white sugar cubes from La Perruche.
1;"""You will not find a better loose green tea for the price.  I was able to get free shipping as well since I bought it with something else that totaled over $25.  This is the tea used by many Japanese people.  Do not fall for those high-priced  organic  green teas produced by American companies.  They are good...but you are not getting anything better than Hime Ban Cha Tea."""
1;"""I love this tea!! It is so flavorful yet there is no cut grass or off flavor as with some green teas. It is so mild that even left steeping it does not become bitter.It has a very mellow flavor that my kids enjoy too.It's great without sweeteners.<br /> It is a loose leaf tea and when steeped the leaves unfurl"
1;"""I have been drinking this green tea for sometime and was purchasing it when I was going to Syracuse every summer.  This year I stopped going there and didn't know where I was going to buy my tea until I spotted it on Amazon and purchased it.  I was so pleased  that I could get it"
1;"""This is the real deal. Genmai Cha. Loose green tea and roasted brown rice. Not in bags. Originally known as the  Peoples Tea  for those who couldn't afford better. Very popular because of its mild flavor. You can drink it all day long (like I do). You won't be disappointed."""
1;"""I am from Michigan but have a vacation home in Canada. I have always been a fan of the primarily Canadian product  ketchup chips . Uncle Rays is a brand I've seen around there frequently. Since this is such a hard to find product I expected to pay big bucks to buy it online. Imagine my surprise when I found these chips on Amazon for a little over a dollar a bag- CHEAPER than the retail I would pay in Canada. Unbelievably delicious! Ps. The dill pickle chips are really good too :)"""
1;Mine came with stickers to sell them for $1.59 but they cost more like $1.25 so if for retail that is not much of a mark up. I bought these for myself so that doesn't really matter and they are cheap. Similar to Lay's but cheaper. Unlike other knockoffs these seemed to taste fresher and the convenient size minimizes stale chips. Great product. Great price.
1;"""These chips are really good. They taste better than other name brands. They're cheaper too!!  They aren't too salty like other brands. The flavors blend really well. Just the right amount of sour cream and onion flavor with a little salt mixed in. Once I start eating them"
1;"""I am very acustom to spicy foods and this has a very rich flavor. Half the bottle was devoted to given people my  not so hot salsa   reactions amazing . Worth the money! as for me eating it the title says it all"""
1;My two cats love this cat food more than the kirkland signature brand.  It's also very cheap and affordable cat food at walmart. I would recommend this cat food over meow mix or friskies any day.  Get 9lives dry cat food.  It's one of the better brands out there.
1;"""This stuff is great if you're looking for a non-alcoholic vanilla extract...yes this is really a vanilla extract not just a flavor like the essence stuff. I read somewhere on the net that the only reason they can't call it an extract is because it wasn't extracted by alcohol so legally they have to call it a flavor.<br />The smell and color are gorgeous plus its fair trade certified"
1;I have used your product for years and find myself in a town where they are sold only in very small bottles.  I am used to buying your product by the half gallon and would like to make my purchases online.  I have tried using other products which pale in comparison to your Original Barbecue Sauce.
1;I used these and a bunch of other colored lollipops for a friend's birthday and she got a kick out of it.  She had been complaining about feeling old so we threw a kid themed party.  She had a great time.  I don't think it's possible to eat one of these spiral lollipops without feeling like a kid!
1;I used these lollipops for a candy princess costume for my daughter. They came in perfect condition and exactly like the picture shows. They do come in a group of 16...such a great value! I was extremely satisfied!
1;"""I had purchased these to go along with a Candyland costume for Halloween.  They shipped quickly and were packaged securely with bubble wrap.  None of the lollipops were broken in transit.<br /><br />It turns out the costume I ordered (from another seller) didn't fit at all and was made of very cheap material so I couldn't even alter it to fit.  Since I had to return the costume"
1;I got these for my sons 3rd birthday. I got it because I am doing a candy station for his birthday & I wanted to put colorful lollipops as part of the candy station. So this is just perfect for my idea.
1;"""I ordered the lollipops for party favors at my son's 1st birthday party.  The lollipops are 2 inches and I used 1.5 inch  thank you  stickers on them.  So cute!  The description states that 16 lollipops are included in the order.  I ordered 2 boxes and only received 12 lollipops in each box.  I contacted the seller's customer service.  I received a response and apology right away.  They promptly corrected the order.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive another full box of 12 and not just the 8 I expected.  The lollipops are wrapped in bubble wrap.  Out of three boxes only one lollipop was cracked.  Not a big deal to me since I did receive an extra box.  Great lollipop at a great price."""
1;comical that this is considered a 'toy'.  I bought these as a decoration for a circus themed baby shower and they arrived in perfect condition. I used them in vases surrounded by colored crinkle cut paper and used as centerpieces on the buffet table.  Lots of compliments.  I have kept them and plan to use again for future parties.  these will  not be consumed so no idea how they taste...
1;"""I love Salsa and have tried many on the market. I served Dippin Fiesta at a recent Sunday football get together and got rave reviews. Maybe the best Salsa I have ever tasted and served. If you want to taste the best"
1;Since being gluten free I've tried all types of GF breads and they are all very expensive. Who knew that the brazilians had the bread game on lock with this inexpensive tapioca version of cheese bread! It's custom which is probably why they are all so skinny! lol But I loved it and will be ordering a whole lot more!
1;ENERGY BITES F'ING RIP YOUR FACE OFF WITH MOLTEN LAVA ENERGY.<br /><br />INFINITY ENERGY TO THE F'ING MAX.  I ATE A WHOLE BOX ONCE AND THREW A CAR AT A BABY.<br /><br />F'ING RAVE.<br /><br />SERIOUSLY THESE ARE GREAT.
1;"""I had heard about their prickly pear tea in a forum and decided to try it since I hadn't had any since I was in Arizona.  It was better than I remembered!  I tried it first hot and then used the remainder for ice tea and both were really good.  The company delivered super fast too which was great.  I recommend this tea highly"
1;"""The normal 15oz can is too much SPAM for one person.  The 7oz version is perfect for me to make two sandwiches.  I cut the block in half.  Each half I cut into 4 slices.  The 4 slices are perfect to lay on top of a toast.  With some salad green and 2nd toast"
1;Our family loves SPAM and Amazon makes it so easy and such a great deal to buy in bulk.  The 7-ounce size is perfect for our use.  Amazing what you can use SPAM for.  Add it to all your favorite recipes in place of other meats!  Super convenient to have it come in automatic shipments without having to give it a second thought!
1;Well worth the price.  Very large chocolate truffles that taste amazing.  Can't wait for Amazon to get them again.  1 January 2012. Just browsed to the truffle page and had a mini heart attack when I saw the price.  They were $12.00 when I purchased them in 2011.
1;Excellent product.  Crab Cakes made with lump style crabmeat has been a family tradition during Christmas holidays for over 40 years.  Local grocery stores do not carry lump style and only offer fancy/minced crab meat which is OK but not as satisfatory as lump style.
1;I have three small dogs and these are one of their favorite treats!  I don't have to worry about them choking and I feel I am giving them a healthy treat!  Please don't ever stop making them Pet N Shape.
1;I am from England and I was raised on this custard. If you like vanilla custard/pudding you will love this. It's rich and creamy and has lots of vanilla taste.  I love that it comes in a big canister and I can make as much as I want to. I would never make a trifle with anything else.
1;life without bird's custard has been hell ! i've tried other varieties-sthg from holland if i recall correctly-just not up to snuff...i ordered 6 to ensure i never run out ! better than ice cream and not half as fattening.
1;I purchased this product because I have previously used it and it is not always easy to locate on store shelves.  I prefer it to other powdered custard(pudding) products for ease of making and taste. It's wonderful in trifles or just about any pudding type dessert you want to make. Amazon gets the product to you almost immediately and at a reasonable price.
1;"""Our dog named  Big Red  loves your liver biscoti and the closest store was 54 miles round trip. I am not too keen on driving that far so I found your mail service on the internet. Now our 8 pound poodle gets his treats again!"""
1;Our four dogs love this stuff! This bite size treat is a perfect size for training. The dogs like the crunch - it's shaped like a small square crouton. There is enough in this huge bag to make little gift bags for friends with dogs.
1;Some reviewers must have a short memory. I've been eating Beer Nuts since childhood and the ones I ordered tasted like they always have (sweet and salty). Bought them locally until I couldn't find them anymore. Great product and price for 6/12oz cans.
1;this is the second time ordering beer nuts....i can not find them anywhere in local stores.  the shipment came (6 cans per order) and 2 cans were damaged.  called amazon customer service and the next day another 6 cans appeared at my door.<br /><br />the nuts are always great (unless can is damaged and nuts are stale) but the customer service was the shining star.  thank you !!  will order again
1;It's always wonderful to be able to give chocolates as a gift and to receive them.  It's great to know that you can send someone  some chocolates with the guarantee that they don't arrive all melted.  Good Service and Excellent chocolates!
1;This was my first time ordering raw cacao powder and I was pleasantly surprised!  The item was packed and shipped professionally and I love the resealable bag.  I initially tasted the cacao by dipping my finger in the bag and I didn't taste anything.  I then placed two tablespoons in my homemade vegetable/fruit juice which normally tastes like bananas...  I was pleasantly surprised because it now tasted like a bona fide chocolate shake!  This is one of the best deals you'll find (online) on certified organic raw cacao and it tastes great.  This is one of the healthiest foods in the world and I recommend this seller if you're looking to purchase it.
1;"""Raw Cacao Powder differs greatly in taste than processed Cacao Powder. Commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted. Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isn't. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste"
1;These ginger cookies are it...I don't have to look anymore ...I have found THE cookie ...I ate the entire box and did not share...so hubby said when I order more I have to get 2 boxes cause he would like to have some..:)
1;We received a box of these at work and the whole package was gone moments after opening it up!  Great biscuits and now I am ordering a couple boxes for a few gifts for people I can't figure out what to get...
1;I love these Wild Cherry Tic Tacs and they are impossible to find in stores.  I am so glad that I can get them from Amazon and the price is excellent!  They are a great low calorie treat and I will keep buying them from Amazon.  Highly recommend this purchase!
1;My sister is alergic to wheat so I make her a lot of Gluten Free foods.  I searched local stores and could not find Sorghum Flour.  So I looked on Amazon and finally found it.  It was all packed wonderfully and arrived perfectly fine and I'm already using it.
1;"""I love baking with The Bob's Red Mill 'Sweet' White Sorghum Flour. I use it in many things but I tend to lean toward sweeter treats such as Cakes and Muffins. I make a crumble topping with this flour that my family and guests beg for! I would highly recommend this flour to any baker"
1;I am a big fan of Sorghum flour for my baked goods. It gives everything a bit of sponge (especially cakes) and adds an extra bit of sweet to the baking. I highly recommend this for baking flour mixes - you may not want to add it to savory recipes though because of the light sweet flavor.
1;Great product!<br /><br />The Stevia powder will not raise your blood glucose level and it is all natural.<br /><br />Use very sparingly since it is much sweeter than sugar.<br /><br />Tastes more natural than artifical sweeteners and is healthy to use since it is an organic natural sweetener.
1;"""I started using NuStevia several years ago.  Back then I had to purchase it from a health food store.  Thanks to Amazon I can now order and have it within a few days.  I never run out!  As for the product"
1;I love this stevia! I have tried MANY different kinds over the years and this one is my FAVE! Goes great in my coffee and tea. I have this one on auto ship and get one a month (makes it pretty cheap too!)
1;"""The first time I tried this product  was 2 years ago at the Venetian spa restaurant in Las Vegas  having  a cup of tea with some friends. We all remarked how delicious and tasty it made our tea.  We've been using it ever since. A little goes a long way and I use it anytime I would ordinarily use a sweetener.  Since the artificial sweeteners are so unsafe and unhealthy and I have a sweet tooth"
1;"""Because they brought bagels to America without which we never could get maximum level of enjoyment out of this delightful low cost caviar.  Caviar for breakfast!  We use the small soft plain bagels cut in two upon which we smooth a bit of cream cheese then a nice ring of caviar in the center of which is colorful and delicious cut up hard cooked egg then add a perfect cup of coffee.  This is is best done on a week end so it can be savored ever so slowly--no stress involved--pure luxury.  Yes"
1;"""Not knowing what to expect I decided to take a chance since it wasn't that expensive.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the caviar.  I put this stuff on just about anything I could and it was amazing.  I don't know too much about caviar"
1;My husband and I fell in love with Cafe Britt coffee while we were in Costa Rica.  Upon our return we were delighted to see that we could order it through amazon.com!  The coffee is easy to drink - not bitter or harsh and is a great way to start your day.  Highly recommended.
1;"""I used Super Gold Luster Dust to create the most exquisite chocolate aspen leaves for the groom's cake at my son's wedding. By using an artist's paintbrush to lightly coat the molded leaves with Luster Dust"
1;"""This product allows me to make some really big splashes when providing spiced nuts at gatherings.  The fact that the gold spreads so easily allows me to use just a little but  show off   People are amazed that this is edible gold"""
1;This is a very tasty item. My wife doesn't eat meat and had to stay<br />in a hotel for 4 weeks during a training she attended. I had this shipped<br />to her and she raved about the great flavor and wanted more!
1;"""As I was growing up my mother always made apple sauce cake for every birthday and special occasion.  After I was diagnosed with celiac I began trying to make a cake that was like the one my mother made.  After 6 years I gave up trying.  Then I saw this mix in the store 2 years ago and got very excited with the prospects.  When I make the cake I tweak the mix recipe a little. I add to the dry mix 1/4 cup coco"
1;"""Just a quick note... a very good friend of mine who also battles weight issues and love pasta turned me on to this product.  We bought a box at Whole Foods and I was impressed by the taste but especially by the low calories and high fiber content.  Amazingly it's about 40% cheaper at Amazon than at Whole Foods"
1;"""Wow ... this pasta tastes just like the real thing unlike the brands labeled as whole wheat pasta. I tried them many times and simply could not get the same pasta-eating experience.  I eat half the box at a time"
1;I am on a low carb diet and have lost 25 pounds.  I was so tired of eating meat all the time but too nervous to splurge on pasta until I came across this product on Amazon.  I cook it a minute or two longer than the directions and top it with full fat Greek yogurt and parm cheese and one serving is so filling and yummy.  Definitely cures my cravings and am now on subscribe and save.  My hubby and son love it too!
1;So many different flavors to choose from.  I ordered this brand for the first time and the taste is wonderful.  It was the only decaf french vanilla I could find.  I have decided to switch from my old brand to this one.
1;We've been searching everywhere locally for this putting.  I was so elated to find it on Amazon.  This is the only pudding my mother made her chocolate pies with and now the tradition continues.  Thank you so much Amazon!!!
1;i followed the easy instructions and these turned out delicious. i ate them all. there were only 6 of them. i mixed 1/2 cup of milk into the dry mix and slowly mixed it together. i poured the mix into my sprayed cast iron 6 cup muffin pan. i cooked them in my small convection oven and they cooked up nicely. they were moist on the inside. the mixes were very fresh smelling and had a freshness date well into 2013. the pouch is a nice tough plastic one and will keep the mix fresh. it is very easy to open also.
1;"""WE LOVE LOVE LOVE these muffins. They are moist and delicious !! We like them best the day you bake them. The 2nd day they do dry out a bit but are wonderful if you pop them in the toaster oven for a few min to warm them up"
1;I really like this soup.  It is mild and I don't like anything that is to hot.  IT is just right.  Has a good flavor and is something I can take to work and pop in the microwave. I would buy it again and again.
1;"""This is a great and delicious way to eat Thia food at home.  Just  melt  the entire packet (if you like it spicy) into two cans of coconut milk in a pan.  Then add your favorite meat and veggies.  I usually use chicken strips and a bag of frozen asian veggies."""
1;"""I totally love this tea.  It brews to a beautiful reddish color.  It is very aromatic and beautiful to look at.  It could be potpourri.  I love the sachets it comes in - very elegant.  I just bought my third canister of it this morning.  I have everyone at my office and my friends loving it"
1;"""My doggie really likes Newman's Organic better than some other dog foods pet and big-box stores sell. My budget doesn't like Newman's Organic as much as Harmony Farms. It's the compromise that keeps the doggie AND my budget happy.  Because he eats it heartily"
1;"""No more heavy grocery bags for me -- I've just ordered my first bag of Harmony Farms dog food -- and it was delivered to my door by UPS.  The food is excellent quality -- I bought this product based on its healthy ingredients"
1;Wish I would have known a long time ago what a difference this dog food makes. My 6 year old Jack Russell has always had the worst shedding problem and I recently read that excessive is a sign of poor nutrition (was feeding her P*urina dog chow). She's only been on this dog food for two weeks and I can noticeably tell a difference in the shedding! She loves the taste and I love the price for such a good quality dog food.
1;"""I have purchased this product once before from Amazon.  It was delivered promptly and in tact.  This is the only food our dog will eat and we used to purchase it at PetSmart in New York but in Arizona"
1;My dogs have been eating this brand for a few years now and having found it available through Amazon I am able to save money per pound and trips to the store. It arrives promptly and is the same quality as always. Harmony Farms is much easier to digest and healthier than most commercial foods. LOVE IT!
1;I just switched my 11 and a half year old Boxer to this food and it is awesome! She switched over no problems with no weaning off her old food. It has cut her gas down and has been so easy on her stomach. It also tastes so good to her that she will eat it without wet food mixed in. I wish I had found this food 11 years ago. It is great and we will switch our Boxer puppy to it when it is time. Also...very affordable:)
1;"""Just to give a little background - I ordered these because they were a great deal for a box of single serving chips and I thought I would give them a try.  The variety of flavors in this package was great and I enjoy most of them.  These chips leave a lot less mess than your average bags of potato chips and there are very few crumbs in the bag.  It is apparent these are not prepared like normal chips and the result is a differently textured chip.  It will be a personal taste as to whether or not you will like the taste and texture"
1;Got this item on a one-day-only sale on Amazon.  Love having the single-serving portion as I am following WW plan.  Only 3 points plus per serving.  Tasty and on the same line as the Special K crackers.  The variety is nice to have and the box will last for awhile.  Cheddar and BBQ are my favorites.  Try them...
1;"""I had only tried the barbeque and sea salt and vinegar flavors that were available at my local Target in 3oz. bags.  I am so glad that I bought this variety pack! Not only did I discover other flavors that I enjoy"
1;A while ago I got a bag of the BBQ at a store to go with my lunch and I loved these so when I was searching amazon and found these on subscribe and save I knew that this was something that I had to have for my lunches. I love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet I have not found a flavor I did not like. Being from England I am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as I would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors I can't complain. I also love the fact that 5% fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack. My only issue now is that I have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as I do. I have now had to go to a box a month but even then I am not sure I can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can.
1;"""I got these for my gf as she isn't supposed to eat any gluten.  All of the flavors taste great and they seem to be much healthier than regular potato chips.  If you are looking for a gluten-free snack"
1;I really enjoy these low calorie chips.  They have a good flavor with a good crunch and are crisp.<br /><br />I was wondering if when ordering a case of these chips one could order their favorites and not the whole 6 flavors?  Say just 2 flavors if desired??<br /><br />Its a great product. don't stop manufacturing them.
1;"""I have been trying to find healthy snacks that taste good and boy have I found a great choice in PopChips!  These are a great healthier alternative for regular potato chips.  I love Special K cracker chips"
1;Popchips is a new product for me--ordered after seeing an ad in Weight Watchers magazine.  Loved the product.  Packing was perfect.  Shipping went fine.  No complaints with this order at all.  Probably will order again soon!
1;This is a great product. I was a chip-a-holic and knew I needed to cut back on them. Then I was introduced to pop-chips.I have found my alternative. These chips are great! Low in fats but high in flavor. I purchsed a mixed case with multiple flavors and was not disappointed with any of them. Consider this product for your alternative to the high fat chips available everywhere. I am sure these will catch on and become a big hit.
1;"""We received our assorted single serve packs today. This is the first time we ordered Popchips. They taste so good. We are already down by 5 packets between adults and kids.<br />Please bear in mind that these chips will in no way compete with  regular  fried potato chips. The low calories per bag is very much a part of why they deserve 5 stars. I'm sure we will be ordering more. Yay to finding a new healthier snack alternative."""
1;The BBQ chips are great.  We liked them better than regular chips.  They have a nice crunch.  Hate Kettle chips which are so hard that they are like eating shards of glass.<br /><br />We will definitely be buying more of the Popchips.
1;These really are good I gave some to other people and they liked them too. The plain flavored ones take well to using them as scoops for your own dip or salsa. When eating the BBq flavored ones brings back memories of yester years when I would eat BBq pork skins while riding in the back of the truck on the range. I think the pepper ones could use more pepper but they are all still good and make a good snack or side dish to lunch at 100 Cal per pack.
1;"""i am trying to eat healthy and could not really find any good tasting low fat snacks. my friend told  me about pop chips that she bought from amazon. she said she loved them and i should give them a try"
1;"""I bought these when they were on a Gold Box deal...thinking that it would be a nice inexpensive toss in for a month of lunches...and then I'd never buy them again.<br /><br />Not so...<br /><br />They're actually really tasty!  Exceptionally crunchy!  And the flavor is similar to kettle cooked chips.  Definitely going on subscribe and save for a while.<br /><br />I don't think they're any more salty than standard potato chips...but they're by no means  low salt. """
1;I received my box of assorted Popchips a few days ago to support my Weight Watcher meal plan.  I absolutely love them and find that they fit in with my plan.  Without hesitation I recommend all varieties of these chips.  What a great idea!!!
1;We absolutely loved the chips and after ordering them from Amazon we were able to find them in Target.  They have a really good flavor and we would eat them even if we weren't trying to loose weight.  Recommended by weight watchers.
1;"""I was very pleased with the popchips.  MY first order was before the chips hit the stores.  The taste is delightful.  No greasy taste. In fact the variety in flavors will keep your palate very excited!  Amazing how it is made.  Calorie count is great too! I went further to send the chips to my family they too were very pleased with them.  My third order I placed for a gathering of 12 friends.  They too"
1;I love Popchips. They are delicious and I can't believe one bag is only 100 calories. The flavors are great although I am not a fan of salt and pepper. I would highy recommend as a way to try the different flavors. I am sure you will love them too.
1;"""I'm trying to eat healthier and one of the things I really love is chips and salty snacks of all kinds!  These Popchips really do the trick of satisfying my craving. Though I don't really care for the pepper flavor"
1;"""These are great - my entire family loves them.  It is a great addition to my son's school lunch - and I have the satisfaction of knowing it is a better alternative then the normal  chip  out on the market.  Great flavor - BBQ and Sourcream & Onion are our favorites!  Love the single serve bags - wish you could buy them at the store - but for now I will continue to purchase on Amazon...  because of the great service and varieties!"""
1;"""I agree with reviewers who enjoy this alternative to the regular salty snack options.  The texture of the chips is great and they're very flavorful!  I can certainly taste the sodium but if this isn't a problem for you"
1;"""These are the best alternative chips I have ever tried. I have shared them with friends and relatives and they all agree. You get enough in the single serve packs to be truly satisfied and if you are a weight watchers customer"
1;The popchips are a nice alternative to potato chips. They are not greasy and only 100 calories per bag. Great for dieters. Fits in with a low calorie diet. Definitely would recommend trying at least once.
1;Totally amazing and very delicious.<br /><br />My favorite flavors (from best to worst):<br /><br />1. barbecue<br />2. sour cream and onion<br />3. cheddar<br /><br />4. salt and pepper<br />5. original<br />6.  vinegar and sea salt
1;I expected..idk..maybe tasteless cardboard...but these are really good..i have only tried the bbq so far..but it packs a lot of flavor and you get a lot of chips in a single serving bag!  I will update after my family beach trip because i am taking the 24 pack with us for some moderately healthy snacking..my only caveat is..these could prove to be addictive..i am looking to watch my weight..and these are definitely a temptation!  Very happy with this product:)
1;I am very impressed with the flavors. ALL OF THEM! There were a few flavors I wasn't sure I was going to like....but they are really good also! The flavors are very intense. You are not getting a bland chip. I'm on the monthly plan but I've already had to order them ahead of schedule twice!
1;"""My son and daughter-in-law told me about these chips and they purchased a few bags at a store and I will say they are higher in stores then you can get them online on Amazon. They brought me a bag and I was hooked! So I ordered popchips online and they are the  BEST  chips!! There wasn't a flavor I didn't like or that my family didn't like. I am a (chipaholic) and these are better for you and a great tasting chip. I highly recommend these to anyone that can't do without eating chips either with a sandwich"
1;"""I liked most all of these except for the cheddar ones.  These are packed with flavor and are a great alternative to regular potato chips as well as being just 80% just as good.<br /><br />The best way to describe these is that they are like rice cakes except make from potatoes.  I hate rice hates but loved these (just the texture is compared to rice cakes not the flavor)and I will definitely purchase them again in the future.<br /><br />I recommend giving these a chance"
1;"""The reason why I ordered this on-line is because the only Pop Chips they have in my store are the regular and salt and vinegar & barbeque.  I LOVE the sour cream and onion ones - actually I love ALL of them"
1;I love these chips...and my husband does too. He wipes them out before I can get to them. The variety pack is a great way to determine which flavor you like. They are packaged well and always fresh. The bag contains a generous portion. I've purchased many times and am never dissapointed.
1;Pop Chips are the best chips I've had in a long time.  I'm a Weight Watcher and to satisfy that salty craving I get now and then these chips are the ticket and they are only 2 points.  And when I buy a case of them they average I think about .94.  Not bad.
1;"""I love these chips. They are excellent! On the Weight Watchers plan they are only 2 points per bag which is GREAT for potatoe chips. LOVE the single serving bags for portion control. Also love Amazon.com for selling them. Can't find them in the stores. I will be ordering these forever. Great product.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVFDOO >Popchips 6-Flavor Variety Pack of 24 [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]"""
1;"""I love these chips and they are a perfect low fat snack to keep me held over through my day.  The only thing bad about the Amazon price is they are about $20 for a 24 pack.  That is 80 cents each.  Sadly I discovered this great snack at work in the vending machine - for 75 cents.  I would expect to buy them for .50 a pack if I have to buy 24 and not from a vending machine.  I highly recommend these chips"
1;These are the best chips ever and what a great swap for all the fat and calories of regular chips.  Not to mention that they come in single servings so when you eat the WHOLE bag it's ok!!!  Great product and I would highly recommend it anyone.
1;I originally found these at a Target out of my home town. I fell in love with them as part of my Weight Watcher's plan. They are a good snack alternative when I crave something salty. I could not find them where I live so I purchased them from the Pop Chips web site which took me through Amazon. Yummy!
1;"""I really liked these chips.<br /><br />They came recommended from my friend and I really like them. The variety pack is great to try all of the flavors - although there were some I wasn't so fond of.<br /><br />The cheddar"
1;"""I love Popchips!! They taste great and they do not have all of the fat that regular chips contain.  I was introduced to the wonderful world of Popchips several months ago and I have not looked at regular chips the same.  I do not consume copious amounts of potato chips"
1;"""I heard of these through my weight watchers magazine. They a had a $5 coupon code so I figured  what the heck! . WOW -- pop chips are amazing - every flavor is AWESOME! I particularly liked the salt & pepper. If you want crunch and flavor - these are for you!!"""
1;I HAPPENED UPON THIS ITEM IN MY LOCAL DELI AND BEING CURIOS I DECIDED TO TRY.  THEY WERE FABULOUS BETTER THAN THE REGULAR CHIPS BY FAR.  I GIVES YOU SATISFACTION OF CRUNCH AND FLAVOR IN A POTATOE CHIP.  GREAT GREAT FIND.
1;"""I have been on weight watcher's for about 13 months.  I have lost 60 pounds.  The most important part to being on weight watchers is too find food items that let you feel like your not giving anything up.  Popchips do that for me.  They are only 2 points plus on weight watcher's.  They go great with every meal (salad"
1;"""I had seen these advertised on the Hungry Girl website but was not big on buying an expensive potato chip.  I was given a free bag at some event & found them to be tasty.  The single serve bags in the grocery store were $1 for a 0.8 oz bag.  Buy them from here and they are $21 for 24 1 oz bags. (Same amount of Weight Watchers points.) If you get two cases"
1;"""Love these chips.  They are perfectly seasoned and of course have no grease at all.  There is also not the cardboard taste of a baked chipped.  The popped texture of the potatoes is nice and light. They are only 100 calories a bag"
1;"""These are the greatest potato snack products I've found.  Only 2 points for Weight Watchers.  Really crispy and tasty.  All of the flavors are great.  My only complaint......it's difficult to open the little bags.  I need a pair of scissors"
1;These are my favorite chips! The BBQ and Salt & Pepper are the best!<br /><br />The texture of these things ROCK!<br /><br />All nicely packaged.<br /><br />Gluten free if you care. I don't but some have commented on that.
1;"""Love these popchips.  They are all great.  Do not care for the salt & pepper flavors.  I wish manufacturer would come up with a variety pack that didn't include that flavor as that flavor is just wasted with each purchase I make (and I've made alot!).  The BBQ"
1;"""My subscription of popchips arrived on time and not damaged.  I love the fact that I receive a great variety of chips which are healthier and at the same time very tasty and satisfying. The way the chips are packed for shipping is perfect! Having a subscription is the way to go and of course the price is so right!!!<br /><br />Thank you"
1;"""Tried the BBQ Popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors. Loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which weren't that great. Good healthy snack without giving up the taste. So glad I discovered these! Salt and vinegar are my favorite! 100 cal/bag"
1;"""This product works great for me.  I hate spending money on herbs just to use a little and have the rest go bad shortly after.  I put some herbs (mostly basil) in here and they were fresh for a few weeks!  No leakage probs either"
1;I've had trouble storing fresh basil because I learned a long time ago not to put it in the fridge.  My cat is attracted to anything in the plant family (with disasterous results).  This keeps my basil fresh and the cat ignores it!
1;"""I am a college student who loves to cook and this was given to me about 4 months ago. I am so impressed with its ability to keep my herbs fresh for such a long period of time. It not only gives more options when I am cooking by having fresh herbs available"
1;Actually saves my basil and cilantro for an extra week or two. Thats enough reason for me to buy! Before my basil and cilantro would last only a couple days and I would have to toss them out. This saves me money and a trip to the market!
1;"""I was amazed at how good this is for canned fruit (which I normally won't touch).  In particular I adore papayas and mangos.  The fruit juice instead of syrup is also very nice.  The easy pull-top on the can makes this a great item to stash in my desk drawer at work"
1;This is an excellent product.  We always ran out of olive juice before we ran out of olives when making dirty martinis.  Now we have a terrific source for great tasting olive juice and our dirty martinis have never been better!
1;This stuff is outragous. It is simply the best olive juice on the market. I tried another brand and it did not come close to Boscoli. This stuff is actually better than the olive juice that comes from the jar of olives. I would highly recommend this product.
1;I used to buy these at World Market however they discontinued them :(<br />So I am forced to buy them online!  The rose and violet flavors are good however I did not like the anise flavor because they were too strong and licorice tasting for me.<br /><br />I carry these in my purse to freshen my breath and they are really good.<br />Also the tin is very cute.
1;"""A family favorite.  These are really unique treats.  The wonderful taste of flowers.  The violet and rose are great.  Orange blossom wasn't to my liking.  The company that makes them have been around for hundreds of years.  They are made in a small French town that was featured in a movie called  Chocolat. """
1;I use these for training treats.  I have a large and small dog and this works for both of them.  They are all natural and my pups love the taste.  I highly recommend these!  I also tried the Three Dog Bakery Apple Oatmeal Woofers and those were a big hit.
1;I received this mix along with a waffle maker as a gift.  It's so good that I keep buying this same brand mix when I run out.<br /><br />I cut the Farmhouse Waffles recipe in half (so that's 1 cup Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix
1;Nothing can compare to the waffle mix delivered by Stonewall kitchen.  My mom complained about the price but I think the quality deserves the higher price than the regular pancake/waffle mix.  The waffle comes out golden and crispy.  I was using the Presto 03510 FlipSide Waffle Maker.
1;"""I have been making Belgian waffles using the Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix for over three years.  My waffles are undoubtedly the best ever!!!  I like my waffles light and crisp - I can't stand a heavy soggy waffle. These just melt in your mouth.  I have made homemade waffles"
1;"""I have to laugh at the reviews that said it was too much work.  So you have to add an egg & a little butter!  It is well worth it.  I am not a cook at all and these come out perfect everytime.  They are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. My family loves"
1;"""We use the Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix to make delicious Belgian Waffles in our <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BXM2LU >Waring WMK300A Pro Professional Stainless-Steel Belgian Waffle Maker</a>. We have tried waffles using <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BQPZGE >Krusteaz Waffle Mix Belgian 28-oz</a>"
1;These pancakes just hit the spot and make me feel like I am eating a restaurant breakfast at home for a lot less money. Splurge on this and the good maple syrup...it really is cheaper than going to Denny's or IHOP where a meal for two will be $20 minimum.
1;"""I bought a Belgian waffle maker sort of on a whim and I was then confronted with the question: What waffle mix do I use? Somehow  Hungry Jack  felt like an afront to such a sublime kitchen appliance. I read the reviews here on Amazon and concluded that despite the rather high price"
1;This is great pancake and waffle batter that was recommended by Amazon so I bought it and have been very satisfied with my purchase.  It makes the best waffles every time I have used it and that being said I am sold on this product.  I will be ordering more as we really like how easy it is to make.  I would highly recommend that everyone try this who likes pancakes and waffles it is delicious and very economical.
1;I have been using this pancake and waffle mix for about 5 or 6 years and I have to say this is the best.  The waffles come out crisp on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  I've tried other mixes but they do not compare to this mix.  I use the Waring Pro Waffle Maker and my waffles come out beautiful everytime.  I follow the directions on the canister and never have a problem with the results.
1;"""I purchased this mix to use with my new Presto FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker and am very pleased with the results.  It took 3 cups of this mix to make 6 large Belgian Waffles and they cooked to perfection after only 4 minutes!  The flavor of this mix is slightly sweet but there is no aftertaste to it like you get with cheap commercial brands like Bisquick.  I'll be buying more"
1;I received this as a gift a few weeks ago.  It is by far the best home made pancakes I have every had.  The taste and consistancy is excellent.  Blueberries mix very well with this product and the container is desinged to keep the product fresh and not let moths in.  You pay a little more but it is worth it in my opinion
1;Bought this mix along with the Cuisinart waffle maker.  Delicious.  We followed the directions and it made only one Belgian waffle.  The next time we doubled the recipe and it came out the right amount.  Good flavor and easy to use.
1;I have a Waring belgian waffle maker and was looking for a good batter to use. I tried this based on reviews and with add my strong recommendation for this mix.<br /><br />It was very easy to make and the waffles had a wonderful flavor ... loved the malt flavor that came through.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying more when the current mix runs out.
1;Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix is our favorite.  Consistently excellent with a nice malty flavor.  The 33 ounce cans are a Good value for the quality. I highly recommend this product.
1;We first had Stonewall Waffle Mix when we received it in a gift basket about a year and half ago.  We have been using it ever since.  The flavor of the waffles are absolutely out of this world.  We won't ever go back to Bisquick for our waffles!
1;"""This was the best pancake/waffle mix ever! Wonderful for breakfast or dinner. It was a great price and worth it! My husband and boys kept complimenting the waffles I made and ate them fast--I could hardly keep up. Definitely recommend Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse pancake and waffle mix! You do have to add a few ingredients"
1;We made this purchase based on our daughter's recommendation and it is as good as she promised. We have a new flip-style waffle iron and this mix provides us with a wonderful breakfast. We add fresh strawberries or blueberries to the top along with syrup and it is scrumdiddlyumptous!
1;"""This is a GREAT waffle mix! I have allergies to preservatives and to find food in general that is great tasting without the preservatives is a huge challenge. I have tried several other mixes and this one is by far the best. I totally don't understand the reviews about the bad taste and  all the chemicals --read labels of other mixes and you will see this one is not full of all those ingredients. There are certain kinds of ingredients that these mixes need"
1;"""I originally received this mix as a gift from a friend in a gift pack.  When my family tried it as a gift they loved it immediately.  It is super yummy waffle mix.  The waffles turn out tasting so delicious you do not need to add any toppings or butter to them.  Here I am on amazon.com placing yet another order for this Waffle mix"
1;"""I bought this on a whim because I found some jam made by the same company and absolutely loved it. I didn't expect much more than basic waffle and pancake mix. This is so much better.<br /><br />It's easy to use and makes moist"
1;I found these at a super Gold Box pricing one day otherwise I would not have looked twice at 16.00 pancake mix.  Now we are hooked - nothing compares to this mix.  I've tried every box in the store for our belgian waffle maker and these top them all!<br />Waffles are nice and crisp on the outside and super soft on the inside. They are so dense they don't absorb syrup or toppings.  I will buy this over and over again.
1;I love these crackers!  Perfect snack for when I need something salty/crunchy instead of potato chips or other greasy snack.  I eat them a lot to hold me over between meals.  The price on amazon is great compared to my local markets.  Highly recommended!
1;I too have begun to drink only Penta water unless absolutely neccessary to drink the other water.  I find that the price of the water is cheaper from the actual website [...] and I get free shipping.  I feel better overall and wish I could get this stuff by the gallon.  Great Product and well worth the price for the improved feeling of well being.
1;"""I bought bottles of this stuff because of its purity.  I have a VPI record washing machine to get the gunk out of the grooves in my record collection.  You basically scrub the records and vacuum the glop off using a mix of water and detergent.  This water is so pure it ever sinks deeper in the grooves and is a visably better penetrating fluid compared to distilled water much less tap (OH NO!) water with all its impurities.  You wouldn't believe how great my records play once they are deep cleaned.  My wife can always tell when I am playing vinyl instead of a CD  It just sounds more alive ---she says.  This water is highly recommended for this purpose.  I may even drink some of it sometime to see what all the fuss is about."""
1;I love this candy and ate it a lot as a kid. It has been very hard to find in any stores. I am so glad I found it on Amazon. The shipping was fast and the product arrived in excellent condition. It still has the same flavor after all of these years. Try this candy if you love coconut. You will love it too!
1;"""My 17 month old can easily eat the whole can in one day if I'd let him. He LOVES these puffs! He just munches on them like they are chocolate (or something that one really loves!). I just lay a bunch on his little table and he will just pick them up so fast and as soon as he is done he'll start whining for more. He does not do that with any other snack! It's insane! I have tried them and I must confess they are good"
1;Baby loves to feed herself and these are a great on the go option. We have tried other brands (Gerber) but this is her favorite by far and I don't feel bad giving them to her as I know that they are high quality. Hubby tries to steal a few away here and there as well :)
1;These are a great alternative to chips.  I wasn't sure how they would be based on other reviews but I am glad I bought them and wish I would of found them sooner.  I have twin 18 month olds and they can't get enough of them.  I like them too!
1;"""My daughter will start school this fall and i was concerned about lunches and fruit-to-go choices. We've bought several different fruit pouches at a local organic store and she and I loved these the most. It it not overly sweet (and a strawberry variation as well)"
1;My son loves these and they are great to throw in your diaper bag or take with on trips.  A lot of time I can't find fresh fruit while we are out and about that my son (he is 1) can eat.  These are great because it is actual fruit and he can eat it straight from the pouch.  Just make sure you help them the first couple of times or else you might have a bit of a mess.
1;"""I bought this for my 15 month old son who has become a very picky eater as of late.  I wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and veggie servings each day.  This does the trick!  He loves them and he can feed himself.  What more can I say?  (Oh"
1;These are awesome and if you know where to find the discount codes they can be super inexpensive.  I love the all natural ingrediants and I actually find them to taste great.  I actually put a little in my older kids oatmeal and they love it too.  I make 90% of my daughters baby food but this great for on the go or as a supplement.<br /><br />My twin niece and nephew who are 18 months old love these as a snack and my sister says they are so great for car rides or trips to the museum.  I highly recommend these over any other baby food product.
1;"""this is perfect for babies and toddlers on the go! we started using the baby version when my daughter was an infant--it is so easy to throw a pouch and a baby spoon into the diaper bag. now that my daughter is older"
1;I am just passing along the 5-star rating from our three Miniature Schnauzers. This stuff is a big hit at our house. We give them each an easy to digest kibble that's good for them and put a tablespoon of Pot Pie on top. No more turned up noses now - they wolf it all down. Be sure to mix it up real good before serving.
1;"""so happy we found this online for a reasonable price.  my two dogs love this stuff and it doesn't upset their stomachs.  Plus I love that it's not made in china or something.  when you look at the food"
1;I give Merrick canned food as a treat and mix it to my dog's dry kibble (and the cat even gets a taste) every now and then.  The Chicken Pot Pie smells better than any human chicken pot pie I can remember.
1;"""I switched to Merrick dog food several years ago (2007) when all the dog food seemed to be tainted with the rat poison - specificlly Aminopterin - and was getting worse by the day.<br /><br />My dog is my life and I would have been devastated to know I had fed her something that would have caused the suffering and anguished death and illness that many of these pets had been forced to endure. So"
1;Now let me start by saying I did not buy this tea as a diet supplement. I bought this because I tried it from a local store as I was looking for a tea that had some peppermint in it but not so much it was over-powering like a full peppermint tea. This has just the right amount of peppermint combined with a green tea. Overall it is a pleasant taste that I could drink all day.
1;I got two bags from my friend who got it from his friend who said it was primo. So I chucked them in a zip-lock when I got home. 3 mos. later I opened it and had some today. I am online trying to find more.
1;"""The pomegranate molasses arrived on time and in good condition.  I encountered this as an ingredient in a Mollie Katzan cookbook and it did not disappoint.  We thinned it just a little with warm water and used it as a side sauce for roasted asparagus at a barbecue"
1;"""Pomegranate molasses is my mother's  secret  recipe for great meatballs. She adds a couple teaspoon of molasses to the meat and the taste comes out incredible.<br /><br />Once I set-up my own household she gave me a present - Pomegranate Molasses of my own. I learned to use it in variety of recipes from deserts to meat sauces. It has a wonderful taste both tart and sweet at the same time. It has deep red color"
1;"""This product is indeed fabulous and you can get it at many grocery stores for a lesser price.  Overall a great product and makes awesome red sauce!  TO SQUISM:  I find it very disturbing that you casually refer to hitting your wife"
1;"""I have two terrier mixes and they love this product. I mix it with their dry grain free dog food and they just gobble it up like no tomorrow. I am happy that Amazon has this product on Subscribe and Save. It's one less thing to worry about since I know it's going to arrive every two months.<br /><br />When I know I'm going to be out of the house for a long time"
1;I am fairly certain this is the same tea sold by Caribou Coffee.  I think I could be considered an addict! The flavor is so good - lots of cinnamon and slightly spicy because of it.  Price for 50 is good and less than I have been able to find it elsewhere.
1;A co-worker gave me a couple of the Harney & Sons Fine Teas Hot Cinnamon Spice Sachets to sample. The cinnamon spice flavor is wonderful. These teas are not available at my local grocery stores. I was glad to find them for a reasonable price on-line.
1;better then I expected. I notice there was some complaints that the muffins were dry.<br />So I sprayed the mix before cooking with a butter flavored publix spray which is canola oil.[same as pam butter spray].<br />This did the trick& they were great
1;"""Awesome little snack treat for your favorite pup/dog.  My two pekeingese just love these.  You can use them for training as well as just a treat.  They come in a variety of flavors.  My pups like the liver the best.  For senior dogs"
1;"""<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002Z9BF8 >All Natural Dog Treats by Charlee Bear - Cheese & Egg - 16 oz resealable bag</a> These are absolutely great treats for training and for use with overweight dogs. At only 4 calories per treat"
1;I am a middle aged runner and take this cherry concentrate to help my recovery time between long races.  This works better than Ibuprofen and is all natural.  After each long run I take a couple tablespoons with my Gatorade and my muscles recover quicker (I experimented with not taking it).  I love this stuff.
1;"""Juice consentrate is very good. I like it as much as the Tart is Smart and with the price increase it is considerably cheaper even with subscribe and save. This will be my staple tart cherry juice from now on. """
1;I am training for a half marathon.  At the start of my training I wasn't taking cherry juice.  As I increased my long runs each week my knees and hips were so sore.  I started to take this cherry concentrate and ever since then I have felt pretty good.  I take the juice every morning with my breakfast.  It has a very strong flavor but mixes well with apple or orange juice.  The half marathon I'm running in is this weekend and I feel ready for it thanks in part to the cherry juice helping reduce the pain.  This stuff works for me.
1;"""I have pain and numbness down both arms from a pinched nerve at the bottom of my neck.  I started drinking this juice three months into what will likely be a four to six month recovery.  Because my doctor has put me on a long-term anti-inflammatory medication"
1;"""I am a long-distance runner and a belly dancer.  My back objects to the dancing and my knees object to the running.  I was having a lot of trouble managing my pain and still doing my activities with ibuprofen alone.  I read about tart cherry juice in my running magazine"
1;"""I have managed to find these crackers in other countries on our travels but had run out. I love that they are individually wrapped small packets in a stay fresh container. This makes them great to carry in my purse"
1;"""This is the best tasting cracker I've ever tasted.  It may cost less in a Filipino or Asian store ... which is all well and good unless you don't live close to one (I don't).  Note that the box says 1 pound 14 ounces - but the description on this page says  28z  (whatever a  z  is).  If they meant  oz"
1;This product is a quick snack very light and tasteful with any spread or just like it is. Takes up hardly ay space if a couple of packets are placed in your bag. Individually wrapped crackers makes it stay fresh for longer periods.
1;"""My family has been in love with Baci's ever since we lived in Europe.  When my daughters were small they coined the term  Baci Pill  for whenever they were hurt or not feeling well.  They are a wonderful treat"
1;My Dogs love this natural kibble.  It's simple (only rice and protein) yet tasty.  They maintain a healthy weight and have regular and healthy bowl movements.  Wellness is a fantastic product for dogs because they keep in mind the many ingredients that are not natural to a dog's diet and keep it out of their food.
1;"""I have a dog with severe allergies we have been fighting for years. The vets always recommend mass produced allergy formulas like science diet.  I can't stomach feeding my dog that type of garbage. But simple is a good alternative"
1;I love this organic raw honey!<br /><br />When using it in my tea I don't need a lot and the taste is great.<br /><br />Honey is also helpful with moisturizing and healing so other than consuming it I also use it on my hair and face often. The darker the better.
1;I absolutly love these candies that are only put on the market at Christmas and Valentine's Day. I would buy them all year if they were available: SO you can imagine how excited I was tao be able to get them for a while through Amazon.I can wait untill Christmas when they will be available again.
1;The local merchants quit stocking this. Was pleased to buy this on line so I can make French Canadian pea soup again. 5 stars for ability to obtain since quality is not that much of a factor. All of Bob's Red Mill products are 5 star.
1;I've tried all three new 'Dark' offerings from Gevalia and I think this is the best one from the three. Gevalia finally came up with coffee worth serving to your guests.<br />Coffee has an earthy bold taste with little to none bitterness and no metallic after taste
1;"""I was looking for some nutritious snacks - with fiber - and came across these.  I've tried this variety and the oatmeal/flax ones and both are very good. They have a dryish texture but are full of flavor.  Wouldn't say they're like home baked"
1;This is one of my favorites.  It's smooth and rich and not too strong for morning but also bold enough that if I like a cup in the afternoon it will do for that too.  My only problem is that I can never find it locally - I almost always have to get it online which is usually more expensive.  I've tried the Obsidian as a substitute and I don't like that one quite as much as the Mahogany.
1;"""my wife and I are avid Keurig coffee fans (with three brewers between the two of us). We started out ordering all the flavored pods and soon learned than are likes were back to the basics ..... we each have a couple of  full  strength and then go to the  de-caf  for that last cup.<br /><br />Mahogany is my choice for the full blend.  It's smooth ....has an excellent taste and aroma.<br /><br />We are totally satisfied with this order ....."""
1;I have tried about every k cup brand....Caribou Mohogany is my all time go-to brand.  Flavorful yet not strong and no jitters.  You get the same great flavor whether you make a small cup or a large one.
1;"""i have this strong flavorful mahogany coffee by caribou in my Keurig.  I love the taste.  I do like strong coffee and this seems to be the right blend of strong to medium.  I use a vanilla diet supplement in the coffee every morning with a splash of torani sugar free syrup and there is breakfast on the move.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474VPY0 >Caribou Coffee"
1;"""My favorite blend of my favorite coffee.  Used to have to smuggle a few pounds of the stuff back in my suitcase everytime I went out to the midwest! Now I can get in k-cups.  Yay! Good price on amazon"
1;"""I decided to try this although I am not a big fan of flavored waters.  It is quite refreshing and the flavors are quite vibrant and not weak as in some concoctions.  I happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be distinguished in the mix.  The one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition"
1;I have tried all the different brands of coconut water and O.N.E. is my favorite and O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pineapple is my favorite flavor. I wish the price would come back down I absolutely love this stuff!
1;"""I feed my dogs Sojos as part of a mixed bowl of quality kibble and quality canned food.  I recommend Sojos.<br /><br />But I had a problem with the Amazon purchase.  Amazon stored the Sojos bag in the original mailing box Sojos sent them.  My order was picked from the shelf and the box containing the Sojos was placed in another box and mailed to me.  The bag of Sojos was almost one year old and there was no way Amazon kept track of that.  I got a refund from Amazon with no question and very quickly"
1;"""I was introduced to these very small doggie bones at my Vet.  My 14 year old Springer who has never been much into doggie bones LOVES these things!!  They make great pocket stuffers to carry around for incentive and motivation.  My old guy has a hard time waking up to go outside and one wiff of one of these bones does miracles.  I have a younger Springer who also loves the bones but she doesn't need much motivation to do anything"
1;Mrs. May's Pumpkin Crunch is the best of the bunch.  If you like pumpkin seeds this is for you.  The slightly sweet cubes make me think I am eating cake.  These are great for snacking and even dessert. A truly wonderful product and gluten-free into the bargain!
1;"""I normally bake from scratch but when I saw this pink lemonade cake mix with matching frosting I just had to try them both. This cake can be made two ways: with or without egg yolks. I recommend with as the cake will be nice and moist as a result. This cake would also be just as good with plain white icing or just a dusting of powdered sugar. You can make it as a layer"
1;"""I have been plagued by white flies for over a year. Neither chemical nor natural treatment has gotten rid of them completely. I decided to try this as it's made by a respected international brand & I thought a systemic product might work.<br />A week after the first application there was no reduction in infestation but by the second week I started to notice less & less of the little vermin. By the time I was ready to do a third application there was not even one white fly or any other insect on any of my roses or any other shrub. I had even used it on potted plants which were also infested & it worked on everything.<br />Remember"
1;This is the best mustard. my husband loves it on his sandwiches for work. it has the right spices and taste to enhance what you are eating. Have been looking for it in bigger tubes with not much luck but any size is great.
1;"""This is the best I've ever eaten.  If you like mustard and you like<br />horseradish this is the product to try.<br />My first experience with Thomy was several years ago when my Son lived<br />in Germany.  He used to send it home"
1;"""There isn't much to say about this mustard other than  Ummm Ummm Good!!!   I tried this for the first time at a BBQ on a salmon burger and it truly brought the flavor out of the meat...now I use it on everything from chicken burgers to homemade Caesers dressing!  You'll love it!!!"""
1;We became acquainted with this mustard when we were in Switzerland and really enjoyed it. That was our reason for purchasing it. Great find!! We have liked this as much as the one that we bought in Europe!
1;"""I've been taking flaxseeds for several years due to the health benefits. I was excited to see such a great price on these from a reputable company. These are the best tasting flaxseeds I have ever had. To get the maximum health benefits you have to finely grind them in a standard coffee grinder. We usually grind 2 tablespoons per person twice a day and then add them to lemonade"
1;"""Flaxseed is a great way to get fiber in your diet and this brand delivers.  It has a mild taste (I put 3 tablespoons in my morning smoothie) and gives you 36% of your daily fiber required intake.  Flaxseed also contain Omega 3 so you also place a powerhouse of nutrients in your diet with this little seed.<br /><br />An excellent source of protein"
1;This is funny I bought the flax seed to make  a neck warmer  I made said to use Flax seed and warm in Microwave for 2 minutes.  Bought 4 bags only needed 2 so decided to make use of the rest. Grind and put over any food the benifits are great.<br />I put mine in Yogert and Cereal. Will diffently keep useing. After this last bag will be ording again.
1;"""I've recently started drinking green smoothies to get healthier and had read that flax seeds have terrific health benefits such as lowering your blood pressure and cholesterol. I add a tablespoon of chia seed and flax seed to my smoothies every day and since drinking my fruits and vegetables I feel better"
1;We are VERY happy with these Organic Golden Flaxseeds.  We grind them and put them in so many things plus they make a great topping for yogurt and cereal in the whole seed form.  These are now a staple in our house.
1;These are excellent quality flaxseeds! I just toasted them a little on a pan and even that made a great snack! I also powdered them in a coffee grinder after toasting them a little and the powder is delicious too :) Delicious + Nutritious = Awesome! :))) Planning to have it in my cereal tomorrow and maybe sprinkle some on my veggies. I think I will also try out Bob's Quinoa and Museli.
1;"""This is the 2nd order i have placed for Bob's Red Mill Organic Flaxseed. It is a good quality whole flaxseed. We grind it a little at a time and sprinkle it on cereal and in yogurt. It keeps a long time in the freezer. I have been using this flaxseed for about a year now "
1;"""There ought to be a recovery program. But the good side is that a Mrs. Mays addiction is healthy. I already have a stack of boxes in the garage so I won't run out. And here I am stockpiling more (in case of nuclear holocaust).<br /><br />Almonds have always been my staff of life -- raw"
1;I have long searched for a great linguine and spagetti and this is it! Just made linguine with clam sauce and each time my husband remarks how terrific it is.  I buy in packages of 5 for both spagetti and linguine and will reorder when close to being out.
1;I ordered this item because it was on sale and because of the health benefits of green tea.  I wasn't certain how good it was going to be but I was pleasantly surprised.  It tastes refreshing and fruity.  The flavor isn't overpowering or fake.  I mix the powder in a sports bottle along with cold water and splenda.  The powder dissolves easily and the drink has a nice green tea and blueberry taste.  I was so impressed that I have signed up for automatic delivery.  It's a great product.
1;"""If you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder. The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild"
1;If you like the flavor of green tea and like your beverage iced you will enjoy this beverage.<br /><br />I like the taste of green tea and I also like the health benefits of green tea.  I mix this with ice water and splenda.  It is a refreshing summer beverage.  I like that it dissolves easily and is packaged in small packages.  It is convenient and easy to use.
1;"""Drank an instant green tea from a major producer for several years. Then they changed production and began using sucralose which I don't tolerate well.<br />Tried several different teas before I found Stash's instant green tea. I like it best with a little fresh lemon lime juice. I can drink all I want--don't even need sweetener. Plus as I understand it"
1;"""This product is great. I have been searching for an easy to use and non sweetened green tea. So many of the teas are sweetened with Splenda type sweeteners and I prefer to use Stevia. The Jackie Chan green tea appears to have been discontinued.<br /><br />I mix this product and love the taste. A little lemon and Stevia and I have the perfect evening iced tea. It provides all the benefits of green tea"
1;I am hooked.  This is a great way to get more fluids into my day without making it seem like a chore.  This powder tastes great without any additional sweeteners.  It is just what I have been looking for.  Also try the Blueberry version.  Delicious!
1;"""I liked the flavor and the ease to mix this tea.  I use a few packets and make a pitcher to keep in the fridge.  Very good COLD and needs NO sweetening as is lightly sweet already.  Doesn't look pretty"
1;I used to always go to Jamba Juice for the Match green tea shots...after trying this iced green tea powder I was hooked.  This flavor is lightly sweetend and the raspberry and pomegranate flavors are just subtle enough to not mask the true flavor of the green tea.  I don't mind the funny green color...after all it's green tea.
1;"""i have never liked green tea but i knew it was good for me so i have been drinking it for a lot of yrs. i grew up living in the western usa and our neighbors were japanese. they were sweet and gave us tea from japan. my father enjoyed it every morning and added a tablespoon of honey and a little cream to it. he smoked all his life and died at 92. anyway"
1;"""This is my first exposure to rose tea. I purchased it because of the previous review. I have to concur. This tea is delightful. The aroma is fantastic and makes you believe you are in the midst of a blooming rose garden. It is a perfect tea to sip in the winter months as it fills your senses with the scents of summer. I bet it would be refreshing as an iced tea with a sprig of fresh mint. Too cold to try that now"
1;WOW!  I am a PEPSI-holic and was gaining weight as you can imagine. A little 85 year old woman introduced me to your tea HOT.  AND now with just A LITTLE bit of honey and ice I have a nice cool refreshing drink!!
1;"""I really like this flavoring. I try to stay away from sugar and artificial sweeteners so this was perfect because it contains absolutely no sweetener so I can add my own (mostly liquid stevia).  I also love vanilla flavoring in many things I make so I sometimes use this in place of extract which can be pricey if you use it a lot. For example"
1;"""We like the much harder to find  white  popcorn over the more common  yellow  popcorn and Amish Country Baby White is our absolute favorite.  We usually order 3 of the 6 lb bags 'cause we go thru it so quickly."""
1;I love this popcorn. Only downside is the shipping and packing. Cost almost as much as the popcorn. Need to pack it better. Bag split and a bunch of loose popcorn falling out of the box when the guy brought it to my door.
1;This is the best popcorn i have ever ate. I use a Whirley Popper to pop my popcorn. When you eat this baby white hulless you will never go back to any other popcorn. I gave my Orville Redenbacher's  and Walmart popcorn away..To many husks. You just can't beat this popcorn. It tastes sooooo good even my puppy loves it.
1;OVER THE YEARS I HAVE BOUGHT A LOT OF POPCORN FOR POPPING AND I HAVE FOUND THIS SMALL BABY WHITE HULLESS TO BE THE BEST FOR POPPING AND NOT A LOT OF THE SO-CALLED OLD-MAIDS I ALSO HAD TO RETIRE MY 20 PLUS YEAR OLD WABASH VALLEY FARMS STOVETOP POPPER IT WAS A GOOD ONE SO IF YOU LIKE POPCORN AND WHO DOESN'T THIS POPCORN AND POPPER COMBINATION IS THE BEST AND THE POPPER COMES WITH A 25 YEAR WARRANTY AS WELL MONEY WELL SPENT YOU WILL NOT DISSAPOINTED WITH EITHER OF THEM SO ENJOY
1;This popcorn is really great!  We enjoy the taste and the smallness of the actual popcorn.  Its not like the popcorn that is big and fluffy its small and really great to eat.  I eat only this popcorn now and order every three months. Highly recommend to the popcorn lovers of the world.
1;I bought this popcorn as a gift for some dear friends. The have commented back several times that it's the best popcorn they have ever had. They love it!  They had shopped in the DC metro area to find white popcorn and could never find it so one look on Amazon was all it took to find this -- the best popcorn ever!!
1;This is the best clam chowder ever. Come originally where this is produced and was so happy when I found it on line. Keep this in my cupboard at all time. Being an old Maine girl this is my favorite chowder of all times.
1;"""This is clearly the best canned clam chowder I have tasted. It is refreshing to have a canned soup without all the unnecessary preservatives and artificial flavoring. The can is supposed to be  Condensed "
1;"""I used to be a buyer at a natural/organic grocery.  This is the best soup I have ever had in a can.  I am very picky about my clam chowder soup as my favorite is The Ritz Carlton's clam chowder.  Just add butter"
1;Pineapple is hands down my favorite flavor of Vita Coco! It not only serves a great electrolyte replenishing beverage (aka the PERFECT hangover cure) but it can also be made into a pinacolada if you just add some rum :)
1;"""I tasted the pineapple flavor yesterday at a friend's cocktail party. She used it to mix with rum to make pina coladas. It complimented the drink so well!! The bottles are really pretty to set up and hand out at a party as well =)<br /><br />I have been drinking Vita Coco for a while now and usually drink the 100% pure"
1;I like this product so much I have it delivered monthly!  So happy to be drinking this at work while my co-workers are stuck with pop!  It's so refreshing and revitalizing!  The only coconut water flavor I like is pineapple!  Transports easily and stores easily with the screw-on top.
1;"""I tried quite a few varieties of this brand and the pineapple is the best.  Light but refreshing.  I am not sure if I think it is a miracle elixer or anything but I did purchase a case and look forward to drinking this on a regular basis.  Thank you for the great value and convenience"
1;I love buying these and drinking them after my workout.  You lose not just fluids but minerals/vitamins and this helps replenish you.  Water is good too for you too but I just love these post-workout.  They are also good for anytime when you could use a sweet but natural drink (like you don't want milk or soda or water but want something tasty and refreshing).
1;Love the pineapple flavor. Makes me feel like I am on vacation drinking a pina colada. (You probably could add a little rum and.....)Really tastes better than other pineapple coconut waters I have tried!!
1;IT SAYS ON THE BOX EACH DRINK CONTAINS: THE POTASIUM OF 2 BANANAS & MORE ELECTROLITES THAN A SPORTS DRINK. THEY MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE HIGH PRICED BUT GO TO GROECERY STORE BUY 2 BANANAS & 2 SPORTS DRINKS AND YOU WILL PAY MORE TO GET THE SAME NUTRITION YOU GET FROM 1 JUICE BOX OF THIS COCONUT WATER...
1;Great real coconut young coconut taste. Not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks.  Good on the environment. Made in Brazil. Even better.  You can really taste the fruit labelled on the product besides the coconut water taste
1;"""High quality coca products do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bags.<br />Organic coca tea bags do not contain preservatives or additives"
1;"""Wrigleys' 5 FLARE sugarless gum is Wrigleys' sugarless replacement for their  Big Red  cinnamon gum. 5 flare seems to be difficult to find in stores. Thanks to Amazon I always have a supply. 5 FLARE is also the longest lasting gum I have ever experienced both in flavor and durability. It is positively the best cinnamon flavor currently on the market."""
1;I love this gum.  It is very dishearting that it is so difficult to find.  I was hooked on the Cinnamon Extra until that went away.  Now this item is not available.  This world needs more Cinnamon lovers.
1;"""I tried this gum after Trident cinnamon became hard to find a couple of years ago.  (Trident told me that they were overhauling the plant that made the gum so it was in short supply but it would be back.)  I quickly discovered that the Flare 5 was far superior to the Trident and I haven't looked back.  It does last a long"
1;"""French roast my green mountain is my favorite every day K-cup. Its a good coffee... bold yet smooth. NOT BURNT (I hate Peets and Starbucks because they taste like the burn the beans). If you like the nasty burnt taste"
1;"""I enjoy them a lot and so does my son. I have to say that this kind is one of my favorites. It is full of peanut butter flavor that you forget that it is only 100 cals. As for the amount you get in the bag"
1;"""One reviewer writes that these are Oreo crackers without the creme--and they are right! These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories"
1;My little ones love seaweed and rice and this seaweed did not disappoint.<br />other brands are too oily or salty or not enough.  This one though is just right.<br />I would be buying it again... and again.
1;I added 3 tbsp of sugar and half tsp of pure vanilla and a pinch of alum  free baking powder and  coconut oil for oil  and it came out soo good. My son loved it . I liked it too. The fact that it's all the major allergens free makes it better.
1;This tea makes me sleep better than sleepy time tea. The taste is also pretty good. I make mine very concentrated<br />with less than 3 ounces of hot  water and I cover the mug top with a plate and wrap a towel around the whole thing<br />and let it sit for as long as I can before I drink it.
1;I began purchasing this tea years ago and looked forward to it each year. For the past two years I was unable to locate it in my local stores so I was elated to find it at Amazon. It tastes like cinnamon and red candy apples to me. I love it!
1;My daughter's Kindergarten class celebrated Chinese New Year and we were in charge of providing the fortune cookies.  This company had a prompt delivery and the cookies were a great success.  Her teacher commented on how funny the fortunes were for the kindergartens.
1;"""I ordered these fortune cookies as rewards for my students each time they passed a multiplication test (to go along with the theme  Fortunately we know our math facts ).  The majority of the cookies arrived still in tact.  I understand that with shipping there are bound to be a few broken cookies.  I am very please with the product and the customer service.  I will definitely be ordering again in the future and will make sure I refer my family and friends to this business."""
1;"""This product is both effective and convenient. We were able to assemble it and have it working within 30 minutes. It worked great as a  maternity ward  for our alpaca millay and her new cria. We were able to give them some private time while not feeling as though they were separated from the herd. I highly recommend this product and will have many uses for it in the future! Please view our pictures we have provided in the customer photo section!!"""
1;"""I bought this color for a cake replica of the Stanley Cup that I made.  I was using this color for the very first time and I have to say that it was perfect!  I was afraid that the silver would be too dark or matte"
1;"""This is the first time I have found a US produced truffle oil that actually contains real truffle. A lot of other  truffle oils  just have  truffle aroma  (whatever that is) and a lot of chemicals that sound less than pleasant. You can definitely taste the difference as well."""
1;This gum is my absolute favorite. By purchasing on amazon I can get the savings of large quanities at a very good price. I highly recommend to all gum chewers. Plus as you enjoy the peppermint flavor and freshing of breath you are whitening your teeth all at the same time.
1;"""I was starting to think that Snyder and I just didn't share the same idea about what's good in snack flavors. I have tried several of their other pretzel pieces flavors (Buffalo Wing and Honey Mustard) and was very disappointed. I have to say"
1;My celiac daughter loves the gluten free animal pasta.  It is by far her favorite.  We make macaroni and cheese with it and she asks for it several times a week and takes the leftovers to school for lunch the next day.  She loves that the pasta is animal shapes and different colors and the horse is her favorite.  A must have.
1;"""I really like this brownie mix.  Unfortunately my local grocer has stopped carrying them - hence buying them from Amazon!!  They are easy to prepare and bake up very nicely.  Very moist and I think it has just the right amount of chocolate flavor.  Yes"
1;If your not into healthy and into flax seed DO NOT buy these.  They are healthy and they taste like it!  I love them...they are very good.  My husband loved them too.  It's all a matter of taste.  If you're looking for a Dunkan Hines brownie these are not it.
1;"""Exceptionally fresh quality and quantity and shipped much faster than expected. I was able to make great Tom Yum soup.  Thank you!<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P151AI >Fresh Thai Produce Kit</a>"""
1;With all herbal treatments it is important to understand that the earlier in ilness one will start using them the better.<br />I love to use herbal teas and find them very effective when used properly.
1;"""I always start my son on this tea when he starts a cold. He actually now asks for it. I prepare it and put it in a thermo for him to drink during the day at school. It works wonders when he starts drinking it right away when the symptoms are obvious. The throat does heal from this tea. If he starts it after the illness has taken full course"
1;These are a delicious guilt free snack that I always have handy. They are so convenient and last a long time. I also get the corn and mixed veggies which are also wonderful. You can get them at Whole Foods but not at this price.
1;"""We first tried this because our toddler went through a picky-eater phase. She loved these! They are crunchy and small enough for her to pick up. I love them because they are organic and a veggie that she actually asks for. I mainly give them to her right out the package but I've also mixed them into scrambled eggs"
1;"""I haven't been able to drink coffee for over 5 years due to gastritis and indigestion with even a few drops of the stuff.  Coffee is my favorite and reaching desperation I gave Puroast a try.  This stuff is a miracle- not only am I symptom-free"
1;I decided to try puroast over a year ago because of stomach problems and mouth swelling.  Puroast did the trick!  Plus it tastes great!  Couldn't be happier with it (although I wish they would bring the organic decaf back!)
1;This is a great company.  And the first I have ever seen to offer a low acid option. You can absolutely taste the difference. It's coffee without the bitterness.  Makes it possible to enjoy the purity of the bean without the bitter taste. They also have very cool black mugs.  Love them!
1;"""I love fresh bread and Hodgson brand is awesome. i usually just use the dough cycle on my bread machine and then form the dough in buns and stickss so i can easily take them on to go. even if the brand is not organic all the ingredients are natural and processed without chemicals. but most of all they taste great. all it requires is some water and shortening(butter"
1;I recently purchased a bread machine and I tried  this potato bread mix.  I have made it three times now and it has come out amazing each and every time.  The other great thing about this particular mix is that I have experimented with altering the amount of Butter ( in the last batch I actually doubled the butter amount but then added less water) and it came out buttery and yuuuummmmmmyyyy!!<br /><br />I encourage everyone who has a bread machine to try this particular mix.
1;"""UPDATED: 12-02-2010 - Finally have found a perfect 'match' in taste to my IRISH grandmother's potato bread. Loaf pictured w/dill added. Very Tasty -<br /><br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDKQCY >Hodgson Mill Wholesome Potato Bread Mix"
1;"""I have tried a few of this brand of bread mix in my bread machine and while all have been good I must say to my family and I that this is the best! I have made potato bread from scratch in my bread machine and this is right up there with that. Nice flavor"
1;"""I am extremely satisfied with both Hodgson Mill Bread Mixes that I purchased online.  The potato bread mix actually rose and stuck to the top of my bread making machine and became entangled in the mixing blade"
1;I love these bread mixes. There is nothing like making your own bread. I admit I use a bread maker - not clever enough to use my hands- but I still enjoy the experience. I have tried 2 different Hodgson mixes and they are both excellent.
1;I recently tried this line of breads on vacation and loved the one we tried. I couldn't find the European Cheese & Herb flavor that we had locally so I went to order from Amazon.com. As happens from time to time the seller was out of that flavor so I picked up the Potato Bread instead and it was also very good.  I still need to get the Cheese & Herb because that one was awesome.
1;"""i thot i was satisfied with the spring water i have bought elsewhere UNTIL i bought this brand! best i have ever tasted. no chemical aftertaste.  i have 2 cases a month delivered since i also use it for all cooking needs and ice cubes too. it is soooooo delicious when making a glass of lemonade from fresh lemons with the aforementioned cubes with agave sweetener. mercy! as others have stated"
1;"""Love this water.  Feels silky smooth and clean when you drink it.  Really love the bottles.  Nice and sturdy.  No squishy plastic.  And since I had hard time buying and carrying from the grocery store"
1;I tried this milk chocolate with hazelnuts for the first time recently after reading a review that this brand was the best chocolate in the world. I had to try it and it was worth every penny. I am a dark chocolate fan normally (70% is my favorite) but I have to say I would order this again and give it as a gift. It melted like butter in my mouth and was beyond delightful.
1;These are great spices to use on all food types giving a great flavor.  The bottle sizes are twice the size of that found in a supermarket and about the same price.  So you get more of what you would normally pay for.
1;"""Surprisingly tasty. Thin and crip. Very Cracker like and good for snacking. I got these for my husband who is on a very low sodium diet. These are great for when we travel.  It isn't easy finding prepackaged low sodium foods that taste good"
1;"""Crisp/crunchy and thin- very low in sodium. I usually prefer mine plain but shared a package with a friend who enjoyed these with a tuna salad topping. A great alternative to the expensive styrofoam varieties sold at most stores. Excellent product. The rice cakes for this brand are also wonderful and for those on a no salt diet"
1;"""I'm glad my 45lb cocker/standard poodle puppy loves the stuff because I trust the brand and its superior nutrition. Compare labels! My previous feed (Pedigree) was mostly corn. My little dude is healthy and happy and high energy and has a glossy coat. Also"
1;"""They have some really good hot chocolate. I got a single pack before and it was so good that I reordered some more. I like to make a mocha by brewing one of these and then one coffee (use a big cup).<br /><br />One thing to note: these dont have a strainer inside"
1;Husband and Grandaughter LOVE this cocoa... Make it for them all the time as I drink my coffee.. My husband is a very picky person but for some reason he really likes this one product and wants me to keep it in stock here at the house.. Loves it at night after dinner on cold evenings.
1;this hot coca tastes pretty good when brewed on 8oz setting however its not the best I've ever tasted nor the worst. its hard to rate this because everyone has different tastes so its ether you like it or you don't. I my self happen to like it and will buy again unless I find something better.
1;This is a great buy.  I love this hot chocolate because it is very low in sugar and has a good taste.  It isn't messy like regular hot chocolate as it is all dissolved before it hits the cup.  Would buy again.
1;I really like the flavor of this hot chocolate.  The kids love the flavor too.  I always keep a box of this in the house as my kids and their friends are avid coco drinkers.  This makes it easier and less messy even for the younger ones.  No more powder spilled on the counter tops this way!
1;My family really enjoys Grove Square Hot Cocoa Milk Chocolate and we keep a supply on hand.  The excellent price is what made us choose this brand but the taste is what makes us continually renew our order.
1;I have tried different brands of hot cocoa from dark to milk and the Grove Square milk chocolate k-cups have by far been the best.  They're big critics in my family and they have given two thumbs up.  I would recommend anyone who enjoys hot cocoa to purchase this brand.
1;"""I bought this because it was a very good price.  It was really good though.  I love mixing a peppermint with a dark chocolate and having a double sized up of hot cocoa.<br /><br />Will keep buying this until they don't sell it anymore. It is really creamy.  I like it best with 6 ounces of water"
1;I've had many hot cocoa K-Cups and I must say this one is the best by far. The Green Mountain one has a half & half bitter aftertaste while the grove square is very pleasant and is as close as you can get without actually using milk.
1;The hot cocoa is delicious and is strong enough to make the larger size. I find all three flavors delicious with my favorite being the dark cocoa.  The best bang for the buck I have so far found for hot cocoa.  I tend to use my coffee maker for everything but coffee.
1;All three flavors have a nice aroma and rich chocolate taste. Peppermint is our favorite. We enjoy a cup after dinner 'flavored' with a bit of creme liquor nearly every night. It's become a tasty habit.
1;"""These Grove Square Hot Cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the Keurig. We took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good.<br /><br />Dark Chocolate - My favorite"
1;"""Everyone in my family likes hot cocoa. I was running plain water through my k-cup maker and using hot cocoa from a canister but my kids didn't really get the right measurements and more often than not we would have overflow. So I decided to try this for my kids and it makes a perfect cup every time. No overflow. The taste is good"
1;My box of Grove Square Hot Cocoa arrived today and I've just tried it. Delicious. Made a big cup [by mistake] but I'm happy with the flavor and consistency.  No off tastes that I can discern.  A little disappointed at high sodium content. Nice to have as fall starts to chill.
1;"""I love these hot chocolates. I think they're way better than the cafe express hot chocolates. These and the Swiss Miss hot chocolate are my favorite K-Cups. And the price of these are the best I've been able to find. My girlfriend and I have already gone through about half of them in about two weeks"
1;I really enjoy this hot chocolate with a little fat free half & half for creaminess. Being that I am not a coffee drinker these k cups offer a nice change from tea. The local stores sell this as well but it's half the amount of cups and almost the same price. Buy from Amazon.
1;You can't beat this deal! 3 Boxes of 16 K-Cups for little more then $20. No other store can even match that price for Hot Chocolate K-Cups. Your normally going to be paying around $12-$16 for 16 K-cups alone. This package give you 48 K-Cups for a great price.<br /><br />The Hot Chocolate itself is great tasting and can be used on mostly all settings for the B70 except for the travel mug. Low in calories and great tasting. Defiantly a must have if you own a Keurig brewing system!
1;"""Grove Square is the best k-cup hot cocoa I've tried.  And I've tried a number of the other brands.  This tastes like  real  cocoa used to taste. And if you add a little milk it's even better. It's so hot from the Keurig that the milk helps cool it down anyway. If your looking for a real chocolate-ly flavor give this a try."""
1;"""This is the absolute best hot cocoa for the Keurig Brewers. All of the other Hot Cocoa's that we have tried we had to  doctor  to make them taste good. We had to add more cocoa and more sugar. I was pretty much making my own cocoa"
1;"""Oh so good. The first cup I had was on the medium setting. It was too sweet. So I had my second on the larger setting and it was perfect! This is a creamy hot chocolate. Add a little milk and and whipped cream"
1;"""I'm giving this product 5 stars because I think it is great considering that it is made with water.  The hot chocolate is best if you shake the cup and then brew using the smallest possible cup size.  If you want a large cup of hot chocolate"
1;Grove Square Milk Chocolate Cocoa k cups are great! I usually make hot cocoa from scratch with milk over the stove. I thought this was easier and delicious. To add creaminess I put in either a splash of milk or a shot of whipped cream--perfect!
1;"""I bought a box of Grove Square Hot Cocoa because I love their Cappuccino French Vanilla.  I used the medium cup setting and added some whipped cream...it was to die for.  Very yummy and almost as good as homemade.  I never noticed an aftertaste like other reviews"
1;"""Fantastic cocoa.  All the flavors are excellent but my personal favorite is the dark chocolate.  I received my Keurig as a Christmas present and I am loving cocoa at the end of the work day...no mixing"
1;This is by far the best hot cocoa I have found yet for the Keurig. I love the assortment and the peppermint is my favorite. I would give these try for sure if you are looking for some hot cocoa K-cups. All the other selections for hot cocoa that I have tried were just okay tasting. These are AMAZING!!!! LOVE THEM! I will order these for sure again!
1;We had previously tried another brand of hot coca k-cups. We bought these since they seemed to be a pretty good value. We actually like the taste and flavor of these more than the other brand we tried. They have just the right amount of cocoa and sweetness. We like the variety of flavors in the pack also.
1;I've heard over and over that people are having a difficult time finding a hot chocolate pod to enjoy in their Keurig K-cup brewers.  The search is over!  This Grove Square Hot Cocoa received four big smiles from my sons. They just went on and on about how delicious it was!  I love having this new coffee pot where it's fast and convenient for all of us!  Super happy with this purchase.
1;"""I mainly use my Keurig for coffee but thought I'd try this one since I love dark chocolate and it was getting mostly good reviews.  I've tried some other chocolate K-cups and had given up on them since they all seemed pretty watery.  If I can taste water I don't consider it real hot chocolate.  I was pleasantly surprised that this tastes much better than the others I've tried.  (I must admit there are many I haven't tried"
1;This is really great Hot chocolate. The price is right too. Usually I find that hot chocolate k-cups are weak or watery but not this one. I was impressed. The dark chocolate is really yummy! I will be ordering more.
1;"""Whole family liked all three flavors.  We've had some of the other brands of hot chocolates and they were good also but just couldn't get myself to pay that much  for hot  chocolate.  The  price was right on these for sure but I was skeptical after reading reviews on the coffees made by this brand.  But it's just hot chocolate so I figured what the heck.  All three are actually plenty chocolaty on the biggest size serving.  Honestly"
1;What I really like about this selection is the choice of three different hot cocoa chocolates.  My favorite is the mint chocolate for it not only tastes like mint chocolate but it has the aroma of a hot mint chocolate.  The milk chocolate and dark chocolate are equally flavorful as well. The price through Amazon is very reasonable.
1;"""I love these! The price is VERY good...all the flavors are really good! The peppermint one is my favorite and I would gladly take more of that before the others. Though the others aren't lacking at all"
1;"""I like this hot cocoa very much it has a very rich taste compared to the others I have tried.Just bought some more of these.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q1VI >Grove Square Single Serve Hot Cocoa Cups"
1;I was skeptical about buying this because all of the other hot cocoa items I've purchased for the Keurig have been awful. I was pleasantly pleased with this!  It is simply delicious!  I will definitely reorder!
1;"""Best one in K cups todate not watery like several of the others I have tried. Will now join the subscribe and save group!<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q64K >Grove Square Hot Cocoa Cups Variety Pack"
1;"""I've ordered most of the cheaper Tea's Etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor AND value. I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ3ZUA >Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug"
1;We bought 2 cases of these. Expire date was 3 months out. Plenty of time to eat. We have 2 boys and got these for them as a snack in lunches etc. I was worried that the product would be stale as stated in other reviews. We've ate 3 boxes and all were fine so far. Kids loved it and I did as well. Prizes were not as good as they used to be but they didn't know the difference. A few were educational and that never hurts! We'll probably order another couple cases. At 40 cents per snack you can't go wrong!
1;a great deal. it arrived with no damage. the taste to me is the best. i have tried most other brands and really got fed up with them. they just don't taste right to me. but this one i can eat right out of the bottle and enjoy it. it tastes so good. i am very happy with this purchase and the price is great also.
1;I prefer jerky with a dry texture but always have a hard time finding a good one.  They're usually moistened soft chunks of meat instead of hard strips.  If you like old-school jerky then I highly recommend this product.  Delicious!
1;"""We live in an area that does not have a lot of stores that carry organic at reasonable prices. That said I found the product to be a good value and convenient not to have to sometimes wait for local stores to restock"
1;"""Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review"
1;"""I have tried many many many different brands. I also did my research on what's the best for my Dane and most of it is expensive. I found this to be very good quality and a good price among Chicken Soup and Canidae.<br />My GD loves this he eats 7-8 cups a day and he would love to eat more. He has a shiny coat"
1;"""It's amazing how little popularity that Diamond Pet Foods seems to have considering the quality ingredients their foods contain!  I worked at a pet store for about four years. Our number one recommendations on foods were Natural Balance and Wellness- two EXCEPTIONAL foods that are pretty expensive.  But for those owners who have multiple dogs or even one large breed dog"
1;My 8 year old Great Dane was itching a lot with the Lamb meal from the big box stores. I started buying this (for cheaper) and he stopped itching. His coat is also looking shinier. I wish I would have discovered this years ago. It saves me trips to the pet store and money also.
1;Mackerel is a tasty alternative to salmon with nearly the same Omega 3 content. My local grocery store hasn't been able to get tinned mackerel for several months. No one can explain why. So I ordered a case of these and have been pleased with the quality and value. I'm reordering.
1;"""i have ordered mackerel several times on amazon and most pleased with SEASONS brand than any other. seems to me the fish are smaller therefore less mercury.<br />packed in olive oil is also a bonus. they are not as  fishy  as others that i have tried. i eat them to get a healthy serving of omega 3. my 11 year old boy has taken a liking for them as well as my 14 year old daughter. we put a small chunk on a cracker and top with a ring of hot banana peppers.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDMW9M >Season Fillets of Mackerel in Olive Oil"
1;I ordered these a while back off of Amazon. The mild flavor and firm texture is great. When they are available here they are about 2/3's the cost of my local super market. They are always good no matter where I buy them. I just wish Amazon kept them in stock all the time.
1;Ordered 2 cases on different dates and got them within 2 days. Cant find these in the stores so please keep them in stock. Make for a great meal with some veggies or a salad...and this type of fish with omega 3's is good for you.
1;We had candied chestnuts that came in a box in France many years ago and have since looked for them in the states.  This year I searched the internet and wa-la there were some products to try.  There were some products more expensive and because the product would be shipped we did not want to be spending a lot for something not that good.  These came in a can with syrup which was different than the ones we had had in France but they are excellent.
1;I used this flour in my usual pizza recipe. I noticed the difference with regular bread flour right away. The dough was very elastic and easy to work with. The pizza ended up being lighter and crispier than usual. I will only use his flour from now on!
1;"""I don't know why this flour isn't available in grocery stores in the Midwest.  Typical grocer flours have a protein content much too high to give an authentic taste to such foods as pizza crust and homemade pastas.  And after years of making homemade pastas and trying to find that perfect recipe that would result in those served in the best Italian restaurants in the US and Europe"
1;"""So this stuff is a must have for making true pizza napoletana.  I'm really thrilled that it is so accessible here in the USA.  This flour makes the most silky smooth dough I've ever had the pleasure of getting sticky with"
1;By faar the best dried mangoes i have purchased. Fresh and full of flavor. The 2 pach 20oz is probably the best value. Order a lot because it will be done before you know it. Trust me it is heartbreaking when you reach into the bag and only find mango crumbs.
1;"""Love this tea...especially love triangle bags more flavor & the tea is what I remember it to be...Happy<br />Came right on time in great shape...Happily enjoying my PG TIPS!<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5JLE >PG Tips Black Tea"
1;I baked my first batch of these muffins and was pleased that they were so easy to make and tasted so good.  Then I stored them in the refrigerator since gluten free home baked goods are notorious for molding.  I ate one straight out of the frig and it was great!  I guess the flavors melded together after being stored a few hours.  I finished the batch one at a time out of the frig without re-heating any of them.  They were so good that way I couldn't bring myself to try them any other way.  :)<br /><br />Our family has been navigating the area of gluten free eating for over 10 years.  The choices just keep getting better as more companies are becoming aware of celiac disease.  I have created an astore through Amazon that has the gluten free items we have had the pleasure of trying. [...]
1;I started giving these to my daughter when she was 9 months.  She loved them so much her first word was cracker (while signing more)!  They dissolve in her mouth so I don't have to worry about choking.  And they are healthy too.  I highly recommend it.
1;"""I love these snacks because they are whole grain and organic. I also love the fact that they do not spill everywhere out of the snack cup like cheerios. I have also noticed that they do not leave a lot of crumbs"
1;This is a very good snack that I feel great about offering my 10 month old.  She can easily  pick up the small pieces and definitely enjoys the apple cinnamon taste.  My 5 year old loves them as well!  I would definitely recommend these to anyone with small (or larger) kids.  :)
1;"""We have a Golden Retriever and had been feeding him the Wellness dog food.  He ate it begrudgingly so we decided to find something else.  I read the ingredients on the Evo red meat and was really impressed.  I gawked at the price but decided cheaper dog food isn't really a bargain if your dog won't eat it or get any enjoyment out of it.  The first time we fed it to him he pretty much inhaled it- and will literally go sit by the bag and look at it like it might just open if he stares at it hard enough!  I agree with the first reviewer that loose stools are a factor but believe with time that will clear up.  He is just so happy that we will keep on buying it for him"
1;I have been feeding my GSD the red meat formula for about 6 months and all I can say is WOW. Before I started him on this food he had problems with skin allergies and being picky about food. Although the price for this food is a little daunting it is worth the price! You feed about half the amount you normally would since its so nutrient dense so one bag lasts us almost a month where a bag of purina would last us about 2 weeks. His skin allergies also cleared up in about month and his coat has never looked better and the dandruff is gone too. The only down side is when you first switch over it can cause some loose stools-but it gets better once their digestive system gets adjusted. All in all if you can afford to feed them EVO its well worth the investment!
1;We have two Great Danes and it is very hard for us to keep the weight on them.<br /><br />EVO is the first dog food that both of them enjoys.  I dearly enjoy not having to chase them down and make sure that they eat.<br /><br />I have also notice that our older Dane is more active since he has been eating EVO. We feed them a mixture of the Innova EVO Red Meat and Innova EVO Large Bite Dry Dog Food.
1;My wife switched our dogs to this food about 4 months ago and she has virtually gone from vacuuming daily to once a week.  The dogs hardly shed at all anymore. No more brushing needed and their coats are very soft and shiny.  We have used other grain free foods previously and liked them but this one is definitely the best we have tried.  It's pricey but we are able to feed them 1/2 of what we were using on the other foods and still maintain the same weight.  This food is well worth the price and the dogs love it.
1;These cookies are delicious. My grandaughter ate a whole package the first time she tried them. She has several food allergies and finding a delicious sweet treat is almost impossible. I will be reordering soon because she has gone through the whole box already and has requested more. I am so thankful to have found this product.
1;"""I read the nine reviews that preceded me and wondered how a product depending on a person's taste could consistently receive five stars.  Is something suspicious here?<br /><br />Nope!  Here's the tenth five-star rating in a row"
1;And I don't mean just for Asian sauces.  This is easily the best sauce ever!  I put it on everything.  It's gotten out of hand.  I go out of my way to see what else I can have it with.  My latest thing is pouring some over peanuts and coating the peanuts with the sauce.  Then I eat the nuts with a spoon to keep my hands clean.  Sounds gross but it's so delicious.
1;"""My whole family loves this sauce. I use it primarily to recreate a dish we had in Maui. It adds a wonderful sweet and spicy flavor to just about any sauce. Service on this order was spectacular. Several bottles arrived broken and replacements were received within days. Amazon service was fast"
1;"""What I like most about this product is its unique taste. Just enough spiciness and sweetness to make it different but it goes with virtually anything. I haven't tried cooking with it but I can imagine it would add a lot to stews"
1;I love Geliva coffee.Its not bitter like some of the brands and it set well on my stomach.I have too say its the best coffee I every had and I tried a lot of expensive brands as well as the lesser expensive this is mid price and I love it.I will continue to buy this frm Amazon every three months
1;I received a box of this for Christmas. It is really good. Not overly strong like most black licorice. It is indeed soft and it has a very simple ingredient list with NO High Fructose Corn Syrup like most candy:<br />Molasses<br />Wheat Flour<br />Licorice Extract<br />Natural Flavor (Aniseed Oil)
1;I have been eating Panda Licorice for a number of years and it is hard for someone who loves licorice to eat any other brand.  This is all natural (which is what makes it taste great) from the licorice root.  Fresh always because of the unique packaging and the most flavorful.
1;This is what black licorice should taste like!  No artificial off-flavor.  No nasty artificial black dye to coat your tongue and teeth.  Wonderfully soft and chewy.  I took a box into work and everyone agreed that it was the best black licorice that they had ever tasted.
1;My daughter and I were looking for some real licorice and after reading several reviews about different brands of licorice we ordered the Panda licorice. We are very happy with Panda and will order again soon.
1;"""Just received these boxes rather than buying the bar type that I did before.EXCELLENT! They are small bite size pieces that are soft and flavorful. Really fresh. I did the subscribe and save and am happy that I did. My husband and I really enjoy this brand. The boxes are larger than I realized"
1;this product comes from finland and is an all natural product that is always fresh and I have never tasted better licorice in my life.  This product arrived fast in a protective box and the price is great.  I will purchase another case now.
1;Panda licorice is great. It is always received fresh and is much better tasting than the Red Vines or Twizzler brands.  I highly recommend a standing order (approximately every 3 months) which reduces the overall price per box.<br />  Amazon is a very reliable and communicative mail order company. ALOHA!
1;"""I visited a winery/vineyard in Tuscany where they sold Leonardi Balsamico vinegar as well as all the wines.  The flavor of this balsamic is so difficult to describe but it is smooth! I was used to grocery store balsamic vinegar and some  specialty  store balsamic vinegars.  It's like comparing skim milk (yuk) to cream - which would you rather put in your gourmet dishes?"""
1;"""Coffee has a great flavor and is not too acidic. Fits perfectly in out  Juan Valdez  pod maker that was purchased at Target several years ago! So hard to find these so was glad to find them on Amazon!"""
1;"""My mom has the Hamilton Beach single cup coffee maker and was using Senseo pods in it. They were too strong / bitter for her and I was searching for something else.  Found these and Wolfgang Puck's and decided to get both for her.  These Melitta Breakfast Blend pods are her favorite! She says they have a smooth taste and great flavor. Granted"
1;Melitta Pods are an inexpensive alternative to k-cups  that also save in the amount of material you have to throw away. Buyer Beware: Pods vary GREATLY in the amount of coffee they have in them. These allow for a good size cup of coffee.
1;"""Though London Fruit and Herb Company's Blueberry Bliss tea is one of the best teas I have ever had I cannot understand why Amazon has not begun shipping it out to customers who ordered this item months ago! It IS now available through other Vendors (i.e. Wendell Tea Company in MA) but not at the Amazon price.  If is's available to them it should be available to Amazon or they should take it off their inventory as an offering.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004A85G52 >London Fruit & Herb Company Blueberry Bliss Tea"
1;This really is the only choice when it comes to soy and dairy free baking (unless you want to use lard).  The Spectrum shortening uses palm kernel oil and has the consistancy of regular Crisco (perhaps a little stiffer).  It seems to bake just fine and if you need to be soy and dairy free I highly recommend it.
1;"""gave these as a gift to my brother. we are both fans of hot sauces so i thought i'd give this a try.  the wooden packaging looked nice and was sturdy enough that it could be used for storage/transport of the sauces.<br />my brother says that he liked the sauces"
1;These eggs are soo good i think im addicted they are so yummy and i cant eat just one i was very satisfied with this product and it was shipped to me so quick said it would take a week only took 3 DAYS!!! im very pleased and will always buy my goodies from this seller.
1;These sausages have become difficult to find locally.  I was hesitant to purchase these online as they are in glass and are very heavy.  But when there is no other option...  So I ordered 3 jars and they arrived quickly and were extremely well packed.  Not everyone has a taste for the sausages so reviewing that is pointless.  But the company is great to do business with (and they do sell other foods).
1;These chocolates are a welcome find.  They taste the same as regular chocolate but they don't spike my blood sugar.  I treat myself to a couple at a time when I have a sweet tooth.  It's great to be able to satisfy my craving without the extra sugar.  And fortunately the Maltitol doesn't seem to bother my digestive system.<br /><br />They're a little pricey but I found a great bulk deal at another online source.
1;It was shipped in a very nice package and I have no complain with the seller. My plant growing bigger and now I am looking for a bigger pot to transplant. It's good....if you are looking for a a workspace plant that needs minimal maintenance this is the plant you might need.
1;"""Best coffee ever. Still haven't found anything I like better. I have never tasted coffee this strong that wasn't bitter at all. Kind of pricey when you start working out what it is costing you per pound but cheaper than buying directly from Gevalia. If this company started opening stores"
1;I was given a pack of this coffee as a gift and it had been sitting around for quite a while (over a year) when I decided to try it.  It was without a doubt one of the best coffees that I have tasted.  Very smooth and flavorful.  I would highly recommend this.  After that I ordered a supply from Amazon. They are vacuum packed (I believe much better than store bought coffee).  I may try the decaf version of this to see how that tastes.
1;I love this coffee but I am not sure what has happened to the price lately I used to get this exact product on average for about 15 dollars and the price has skyrocketed to $40.  I am hesitant to buy this product again for this price
1;I bought this for my husband who has been drinking espresso all his life. On a recent trip to Italy we bought the lavazza rosa espresso and I was able to find it and order it on amazon. I bought the gevalia just to try something new and based on the reviews I thought it might be a good idea. My husband loves it and actually prefers it to the Lavazza.  I just bought another 3 pack. we use a stove top Bialetti and this is fine for that type of maker. Highly recommend!!!
1;"""I have been ordering Koeze nuts over 20 years now.  The quality is as good now as they were when I was given my first jar.  I gave these to my son in law the first christmas we spent together and when he opened them his comment was  these are wallhangers .  They really are the best nuts I've ever had.  Enjoy!!!"""
1;Koeze Colossal Cashews are most delicious  cashews I have ever tasted and they are HUGE.<br />They aren't kidding when they call them jumbo.  They  are so very flavorful.<br /> Order these and you won't be disappointed<br />(expect you'll wish you had ordered a larger size).
1;I ordered personal items for the first time from Amazon and I was very satisfied.  The product came shipped securely and the description of the product matched perfectly.  I will order again going forward.  Amazon has not disappointed yet.  I love the DOVE Body Wash!  It smells very fresh and clean and really keeps the skin moisturized well.  I have combination skin.
1;My wife uses this and she has no complains. It makes her smell nice and clean and it foams well. great moisturizer inside. I personally don't care for it because it feels slimy on my skin after use. I guess that is the moisturizer working. Very good smell though.
1;Very pleased this stuff smells so good. My roommies LOVE to sniff the shower after ive been in there. the first one got lost in the mail but customer service sent me a second one and upgraded to overnight delivery. So it gets 5 stars from me.
1;"""Needed the soap b-4 weekend. Ordered on Thurs and paid the extra next day shipping (even though I'm Prime) because no delivery here on Sat). Stuff came s promised on Friday and in good package. The price of the soap"
1;I've been using Lourdes Chimichurri for years - The stuff is awesome. I use it mostly when cooking fish but have recently started to put it in my family's sandwiches. We're also big fans of the guava and mango spreads. Highly recommend these products if you're looking for great taste without the preservatives.
1;"""I like this product much better than the canned sardines I am able to find at my local grocery stores.  I buy Rolland and Seasons ( both sold by Amazon ) and in my opinion they are superior in both taste and texture.  It is a toss up for me as to skinned and boneless opposed to the skin on with bones - I like both - there are probally more nutrients in the ones with bones"
1;"""Sardines are rising in popularity as people discover more about their health benefits... and that they aren't so stinky after all (especially less so after cooking!).<br /><br />I've used numerous varieties of the Roland sardines: olive oil"
1;"""Just had my 1st can of these sardines and I am delighted!  Big sardines in the can with a most excellent mild flavor.  Made a tuna salad...but used sardines.  Wonderful!  I have to say that I really didn't notice that they were low sodium as far as affecting the overall sardine taste.  Love the ones without oil as I don't really like that greasy fish taste you get with some sardines.  I just got diagnosed with hypothyroidism"
1;I've eaten a lot of sardines in my life and by far these are the best. The extra cost of boneless/skinless is worth it cos there is more to eat and less waste.  Love the water packed instead of the gooeyness of oil. Excellent
1;"""I buy skinless sardines packed in water to keep my intake of sodium and chloresterol down.  For about $2 a can including tax and delivery I feel I am getting my money's worth.  I cannot get these kinds of sardines at the local supermarket.<br /><br />Sardines are somewhat tasteless.  I put the sardines on salad and top the salad with olive oil and red wine vinegar.  If I eat the sardines as a sandwich"
1;"""I was looking for a low calorie cocktail and mixed a Rose wine with the Fresca Peach and it was delicious and I am not a regualar soda drinker and don't normally drink Rose wine. Make sure to get a Rose that is not sweet or you might as well drink Kool-aid. Look for off-dry or bone dry Rose's"
1;"""I was looking for a healthy alternative to regular wheat grass which is becoming harder to find in health stores... and this is not just for me! I also grow this in trays for my 2 cats who live indoors"
1;"""I have a very bad habit of snacking that I can't get rid of. So I purchased this to make snacking a little less bad. The first time I tried it I was like UGH it's gross! But soon it started to grow on me. It's very crispy"
1;"""Put simply this is a brilliant piece of kit... does exactly what it says on the tin... converts any XLR mic to USB  - including phantom power supply.<br /><br />We have an Neuman professional condenser mic here at Blockhouse tv and I kid you not  - it sounds amazing with this piece of kit.  Have plugged into our mac and thrown the signal into Audacity and/or Final Cut pro and it sounds the business - no hum"
1;"""ive heard mixed reviews of this.. yeah it feels cheap... but so what?! just take care of it like you would anything like that! and it sounds perfect! i use it to record vocals on logic studio (i get others to sing"
1;I use this with my Audio Technica condensor. Works great for home recordings hooked up to garageband on macbook pro for rough recordings. Its super simple to use and has a dial for the gain. It's not bulky which is a nice.
1;"""Bought this because i didnt want to pay 100 plus for the alternative. Found it to be extremely reliable. Very crisp sound with little to no background noise. Before i bought it other reviews stated it seemed a bit cheap. I disagree"
1;"""I use this to record in GarageBand on my MacBook. It works unfailingly and sounds as good as it should considering my primitive setup. I love the level knob and the quality construction. If you read the instructions and use it correctly"
1;This product works just as advertised!! Guitar center told me the only way to connect my mic to my computer was either an expensive converter box or a usb mic. A-HOLES haha. I love this little gizmo and would definitely recommend it to a friend!!
1;"""I bought the ICICLE because I have been doing a lot of hip-hop vocals and I was using a Samson C01U and the thing with that Mic you can get close to studio but with so much work and you can always tell that you messed with it alot.<br /><br />Well I always wanted to buy a expensive Mic but didnt want to spend $200 more on a USB Pre-Amp so I see this on here the other day and went to Guitar Center and after deciding for a while I went with it. I also already had a MXL V-88 which is a pretty high end condenser mic"
1;I needed the Icicle to provide better audio quality for recordings I was doing on my PC. I wanted to use my high quality XLR mic for this purpose and found that the Icicle provided far better performance than any other USB mic that I currently owned. I didn't have any problem with the trim pod on the Icicle as reported by a previous review so maybe Blue Mic has corrected that issue.<br /><br />I have and do recommend this to anyone that wants to use their current XLR mic on their PC. The product is great and the price is right.
1;"""Finally a gluten free mix that tastes great! I have used this mix over and over and I have never been disappointed. It works just the way the regular mix works and it has opened up a whole new world for me. I thought I would never be able to find a mix that I like"
1;"""I have now served Gluten Free Bisquick Pancake and Waffle Mix to several of our friends and relatives. I usually make waffles and have even done a taste test with regular Bisquick and 5 people. Everyone liked gluten free best!  I am so happy that I can buy it on Amazon as it is twice as much in the grocery stores.  Thank you for carrying this great product.<br />Alice Miller"
1;"""Wow... it's delicious!<br />The kids Love it!<br />We made it for breakfast this morning... the pancakes were eaten in no time at all!<br />The only complaint was that there wasn't more!<br />(actually"
1;It's great! I actually used this to make gf donuts the other day. I love how convenient it is. It's so hard being gluten free so this is god sent for how many things you can make with this. I have celiacs and I haven't had any sort of negative reaction to this. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who can't have gluten but still wants things like pancakes and waffles and donuts and other fun things.
1;"""We use this mix for pancakes and waffles and it's perfect. We have had a terrible time finding a good all purpose flour that is gluten free (the popular brands taste terrible!) so we tend to use this pancake mix as a base for a lot of our recipes--- including breading for baked chicken and other things. It's definitely best as a pancake mix of course"
1;I recently went gluten free and this is one of my favorite mixes.  I used it for biscuits and pancakes and it's very good.  You can also use it for pizza dough and to make fried chicken - it's about average for that.
1;"""If you only knew....<br /><br />Bisquick Gluten Free(GF) is by far one of the best options out there for people with Celiac or Sensitivity to Gluten.<br />I honestly don't know how healthy it is for you. What I do know it that it is a great option for people trying<br />to eat as normal as possible. This GF option has been a great meal saver for my wife who this last year was diagnosed<br />with Celiac and got sick in tired of tasting gross tasting GF options or super simple meat and vegetables options for meals.<br /><br />We have made all types of breakfast items"
1;I find it really hard to believe this is GF because it tastes better than any GF product I've EVER had. I made waffles with it this morning and I didn't even want butter or syrup! It was THAT amazing! I want proof that this truly GF...
1;So grateful for this!! What an amazing mix. It can be used to make some of the best gluten free products out there. What a break through for us gluten free individuals who miss REAL mixes. Some of the other ones on the market just dont do the trick like this does :)
1;"""Thank you thank you thank you.....I have an intolerance for Gluten and Bisquick is my hero. I have tried some of those other packed product and invested in loads of ingredients to make my own mix but  Bisquick  has saved me from myself. Again thank you thank you thank you"""
1;I love this!  Such a great product for all us gluten free folks!  It works the same as the regular Bisquick. Their website has tons of gf recipes too!  This makes delicious pancakes and 'magic crust' pies. Yummy!
1;This is great as a pancake mix.  It almost has a corn texture to it.  I rate everything by if my son will eat it.  He is super picky and loves the pancakes.  I tried making biscuits with the mix that didn't turn out very well but as far as pancakes it rocks.
1;I have this on auto ship because I use it so much. I have gone to every grocery in AZ and the cheapest place is Amazon! This is a great product and whatever you make using this flour will taste great. My son has Celiac and is allergic to gluten. I have tried every pancake mix and this one is the one I settled for!
1;"""This is a product that is delicious and easy to use. I made the pancakes with buttermilk and the recipe on the box just said milk. The buttermilk helped make the pancakes light and fluffy. I am a little disappointed that the box will only make one recipe that calls for two cups of the mix. I doubled my recipe for the pancakes which made 14<br />4 inch pancakes.  The recipe says it makes 10 pancakes with 1 cup of the mix. Those 10 pancakes must be silver dollar size.  I am looking forward to making the biscuits so I will have to open a second box to have enough mix. The recipe calls for eggs for biscuits and I never used eggs in my regular biscuits.  I am wondering if buttermilk would make these biscuits rise sufficiently? I have family members who can't eat eggs or milk so I must adapt recipes for them. It is a product I would purchase again. However"
1;I use this to quickly make gluten/egg/dairy free pancakes.  I use rice milk and EngerG egg replacer to make pancakes. They taste pretty good and are a good snack to make for later and store in the fridge.  They're especially good w/either apple butter or peanut butter on them besides the usual maple syrup!
1;I have so many food allergies it's ridiculous! I am so happy that they made this product and that is available at a decent price. I was able to expand my meal plans and make stuff I thought I couldn't have anymore. I made a pizza with my family all in town using this and then a pizza using a different crust and the whole family liked my bisquick crust better. They said it was lighter and had more taste! I really enjoy finding things that make my crazy diet easier to deal with. Thank you thank you thank you.
1;"""I do a lot of  from scratch  gluten free cooking but there is nothing that can replace Bisquick. From the ease of morning pancakes to using it in other reciepes in place of other mixes there is simply nothing that I cannot do with this little box."""
1;"""Gluten Free goes mainstream with the addition of gluten free Bisquick.<br />General Mills does a good job making the gluten free version of their famous brand!<br /><br />Are you gluten free? Do you know someone that is? An estimated 12 - 50 million Americans are affected by gluten"
1;Hubby had to switch to gluten free because of gluten intolerance so we tried this and made pancakes. They were great and had sort of a corn bread texture to it. FYI: i made cobbler from an regular bisquick recipe (not gluten free) and the measurements do not transfer. The proportions are different with the gluten free mix so make sure you have the right recipe for what you're making.
1;"""It was wonderful.  We made chicken nuggets.  It was light and coated the chicken very nicely.<br /><br />I highly encourage you to purchase this.  Taste pretty much like regular bisquick.  Has many uses flour"
1;This is a blessing to those of us who are GF.  There are so many things we can make again now that we have Bisquick!  Not to mention that pancakes finally taste like pancakes again!  How nice to be able to have a biscuit with dinner again!  Since GF products are so expensive the best place to get it is at Amazon on the automatic shipment plan.  It's great!
1;"""Our family has been wheat-free for 3 years and gluten-free for 1 1/2 so we've tried just about every mix out there.  I just found that Bisquick has a GF mix while in the grocery store and decided to give it a try.  This is DEFINITELY the best mix that we have ever tasted: smooth"
1;"""The best gluten free mix I've tried.  Of the recipes on the box I can vouch for the pancakes and the waffles- the biscuits were edible if not enjoyable.  The pancakes and waffles also freeze well.  I also recommend Betty Crocker's  Glutenfree Recipe Collection  magazine for extra recipes to try with or without this mix. From the magazine I have thus far made the chicken and dumplings (the dumplings disintegrate a bit too easily but are still good) and the fruit swirl coffee cake (I used a full can of pie filling per 8X8- I used apple and lemon pie fillings.  I thought the cake tasted rather like a cobbler or dry danish pastry).  The mix is quick"
1;"""We cant say enought about the Gluten Free Bisquick.. My husband and all three kids are allergic to Wheat and we are on a strick Gluten Free diet in our house.. I have tried every product out there to make pancakes"
1;"""This Bisquick Gluten Free mix is amazing.  I haven't had a biscuit or banana bread in over a year and now I just can't stop making things.<br />I just made Banana Bread (for the 3rd time with this mix) and my family loves it.  I use it for everything"
1;"""I absolutely LOVE this product - being able to have pancakes was my original goal - however - I made the pizza with it & was absolutely thrilled about the pizza<br />These are small boxes (makes two pizzas per box)"
1;WOW!  Thank you BISQUICK for coming up with a gluten free product.  I tried it and it works wonderfully.  So far I have used ot for waffles (recipe on the box) which were excellent and a baked chicken and SPIKE recipe which was also wonderful.  Anyone needing gluten free products will like this.
1;"""It was recently suggested to me I try going gluten-free to battle an autoimmune thyroid disorder.  I bought the Gluten-Free Bisquick hoping the pancakes would at least be edible.  The Bisquick has far exceeded my expectations!  The pancakes are light"
1;"""We just bought this the other day because for about 2 years we have found that biscuits are a very hard wheat/gluten free item to make...I LOVE IT!!! I even went further and put holes in the middle of the biscuit dough"
1;"""When I first found out that my 4 year old I had to go Gluten free I was a little worried about how she would handle it. GF Bisquick has made it a lot easier. I have been able to make her favorite foods such as chicken fingers"
1;I just recently had to go gluten free and have been disappointed by the gluten free flours and baking mixes.  I bought this and it's amazing!  Just like the original Bisquick.  Although it is cheaper at Walmart.
1;1 cup gf Bisquick<br />1 cup soy or almond milk<br />3/4 cup sugar<br />cinnamon to taste<br /><br />Pour over your favorite fruit and bake for for a quick delicious cobbler.<br /><br />Gluten-free Bisquick isn't quite as fluffy and crumbly as the original but it is definitely worth it for the GF crowd.
1;I was able to use this Gluten free product and make it taste better than any restaurant by bringing the buttermilk to room temperature and separating the yokes from the whites and adding additional baking powder and baking soda to the recipe. I love it. Served with pure maple syrup brings it out of this world.
1;I tried this today with a recipe from my Bisquik cookbook for a chocolate chip cookie recipe. They came out great! My son who has Autism and food sensory issues came back for seconds. My 16 year old daughter stated they tasted like regular cookies. The recipe was easy but took my whole box of mix. They stayed puffy as I like my cookies that way anyway. I experimented with one tray and refrigerated it. It did not matter other than taking another couple minutes of baking. Will definitely buy this mix again.
1;My daughter that is 16 and allergic to Wheat refuses to follow the diet. Until I bought this. Now I make her Waffles and freeze them every few days. I usually get 7-8 waffles out of a box. They are excellent.
1;I just recently bought Gluten Free Bisquick for the first time.  It has been wonderful.  I have to admit that I am addicted to their pancakes. They are so light and thick and fluffy (unlike homemade gluten free pancakes).  They are absolutely delicious!
1;"""I was happily surprised with this product. I read other negative reviews and was honestly disappointed in Betty Crocker gf cake mix so I didn't feel the need to try this. I finally bought it at a whim when I saw it at my local market and I am happy I did. I am a baker at heart and love to spoil my family with homemade deserts and pancakes on the weekends. I have adjusted my cooking and baking to primarily gf for the past year now and am happy when I find a gf alternative that cooks & tastes like  the real thing . Another plus is that I can buy this at my local market (which does not carry too many specialty foods) and don't have to make the extra trip to the higher end store.<br /><br />I made pancakes today and they were a hit with everyone. Will definitely use it to try other recipes.<br />Only downside is the cost and size of box"
1;Extremely happy with Bisquick gluten free!  I had no idea what to expect and was very pleasantly surprised.  I always preferred Bisquick pancakes over other popular brands through the years.  I am happy to say that I can eat my favorite brand of pancakes again without any health repercussions (gluten intolerant).  My next objective is to make the roll recipe on  the box.  I wish all manufacturers would take note of the rising gluten problem in this country!
1;"""My wife and daughter are Celiac but my son and I are not. We have been using Bob's Red Mill GF pancake mix and it's pretty good but you can tell it's gluten free. The pancakes we made today with this Bisquick mix were amazing. My mother"
1;I have purchased San Francisco Bay coffee before. I have always found that the quality of their coffee is excellent. The beans are always well chosen and slow roasted. A very high quality coffee at a reasonable price.
1;"""What a steal!  I make a lot of Gingerbread Cookies during the holidays - large ones - over 6  long - and I bag them in florist corsage bags.  They look like you bought them at a fancy store.  These decorations are the best and they are so cheap."""
1;"""I love this sampler of Ghiradelli Chocolate Intense Dark Squares especially now that nutritionists recommend you have an oz. of dark chocolate each day that is over 70% cacoa.  Chocolate is a vegetable a friend reminded--it's a bean!<br /><br />These chocolates are affordable"
1;"""Thank goodness for MexGrocer. We love this Pico Pica sauce. I cannot find this product in local grocery stores anymore.  Internet shopping makes living in a podunk town bearable. No more long lists saved for the occasional trip to the  big city . I am on a first name basis with the UPS and FedEx drivers. USPS shipments are hit and miss"
1;"""This is a very different sauce - nothing like anything you'll find in the grocery store. It's closer to the  botique  salsas that have recently appeared with the new  taco restaurant  trend. It's a little smokey. My picky 3-year old will eat a burrito with this on it. My family always had this (mild) on the table in Southern California and now that I've been transplanted in South Florida I am happy to mail-order. You can get the little single-serve pouches directly from the company"
1;I ordered this salt collection for my husband as a Christmas gift. He absolutely loves it and has used it every night since. This is a great gift for anyone who enjoys cooking. I will be ordering the second collection for him soon.
1;"""Last year I gave this along with <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845979125 >Salt: Cooking with the World's Favorite Seasoning</a> to my foodie friends and family. They all loved it! The salt tubes were well packaged and I ordered 10 sets and had no broken tubes. The package also came with salt samples which I really appreciate. I have Collection Sets 1 and 2 on my counter and get lots of comments about them when people visit."""
1;"""On Sept.12 I posted the following seller review:<br />  3/5 stars:<br />   I'm sorry to say that this item arrived with some slight cosmetic damage. On the top front edge of the rack there is what I would call a dent"
1;"""These french twists are delicious.  I am on Weight Watchers and 2 of these twists have a ONE Points Plus value.  All the flavors of these are fantastic.  You can eat cookies and still be healthy.  Please Barry's Bakery"
1;"""I saw these in our local commissary one day and decided I *had* to give them a try.  I was only looking for something that might be a better for me choice to satisfy my sweet tooth.  I had no idea how much I would like these and have to have *more*.  I got one bag of the Raspberry and one bag of the Maple and I love them both!!!  I'm thrilled to see that they are a much healthier alternative than most baked goods"
1;You can't beat the price and taste of this coffee. It will always be my first choice to buy. My husband brought it home one day because he liked the price and thought the the can looked neat. Little did we know it would become our new favorite.
1;"""Can't  go wrong with this.  Remember its jingle:   Better coffee a millionaire's money can't  buy!   Always priced right and in this economy that's  not always easy.  Frankly I prefer it over Starbucks where one can easily spend the same amount on ONE cup of coffee!"""
1;I love this tea.  I have issues with added flowers and flavorings in other teas and Revolution teas tell you exactly whats in it and there are no additives!  I have been ordering from them ever since my first box of tea.  I take it to the office and I have a travel container and take it with me to restaurants.
1;"""I've been using this tea for for about 6 months and drink it as iced tea daily.<br /><br />I microwave my water on high in a pyrex 2 cup glass container for 2 minutes on high and then pop the little white mesh bags in for about 5 - 15 minutes. I use about 3 - 4 bags for a rich taste and since I'm going to be pouring it over ice. I put my ice cubes in a large glass and pour my hot tea over the ice"
1;"""My wife and I both thought this is a nice cup of coffee. The bag has a one-way valve on it to keep the air out and arrived virtually flat. When brewed in our Cuisinart drip coffee maker it has a  nice aroma. I take mine with cream and sugar"
1;Smooth with no sacrifice in taste and does taste as good as regular coffee.  I usually don't have any coffee after dinner and never really cared for decaf but I now have an after dinner alternative and no sacrifice in flavor.
1;I've decaffinated a few times and always find myself returning to caffinated coffee for the flavor. With this product I won't have to do that anymore. The flavor of this coffee is exceptional. It's as full and rich as any off the shelf coffee I've ever tasted. Highly recommended.
1;"""Soon as I got this bag of decaf I made a big mug and it filled my house with the wonderful aroma of high quality fresh brewed coffee.  It is very finely ground but I still used the same amount I normally do and it turned out great.  I added some soy milk"
1;If you like to have a cup of coffee after dinner with desert then this is perfect.  I love it especially for the fact that I don't feel like a live wire all night from having caffine and the flavor is amazing.  Nothing like a good cup of coffee to make you feel warm and fuzzy after a wonderful dinner.<br /><br />I have tried many different coffee's and have to say this one has a wonderful full flavor without the bite of some of the cheaper coffee's.  Melitta is a great brand and well worth the money.  I also use this to make latte's and it's great.  It's a really fine grind and great for which ever way you prefer to have you cuppa java.  You get what you pay for and this is well worth every penny.
1;"""Was glad to find this procuct on line as it is not sold in stores around here.  Found a jar at a grocery outlet and decided to give it a try.  Sure glad I did.  I researched this company and they have been in business since 1898. This is the only preanut butter I really like. It is made with peanuts with no sugar and chemicals added to make it taste better.  It doesn't need to add anything"
1;"""This product is very good but I have this feeling that it is rather highly priced. I don't know why gluten free products in general are very expensive when they are made from easily available ingredients.People with Gluten problem are not just  eating Healthy  but are sick and should not be exploited. I like the muffins particularly when they are toasted."""
1;"""THANKS TO AMAZON FOR CARRYING THIS WONDERFUL PRODUCT . MY LOCAL GROCERY STORE NO LONGER CARRIES THIS PRODUCT AND GENERALLY PROMOTES THIER PRIVATE LABEL HOUSE BRANDS .<br />FOR THOSE FOLKS WHOM ENJOY FETTUCCINE ALFREDO "
1;I highly recommend this product.  Can't beat the calorie count.  My favorite use is putting natural crunchy peanut butter and blackberry jam between two pieces.  Also great with cheese.  Healthy product.
1;This stuff is AMAZING!  Fast shipping and most of all the best tasting sugar free low calorie item on the market.  Bravo!  I use it in my coffee and its a real treat.<br /><br />THANK YOU!  Will be ordering more very soon.
1;"""<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VMBDI >WILTON 13 PC GOLF SET 1306-7274</a><br /><br />I am very happy with this product I purchased this item for my collages retirement celebration. I have received numerous comments! WOW everyone wanted to know where I purchased these Items"
1;The BEST sugar substitute at this time. Swerve is virtually replacing sugar in our home. Bakes and measures the same as sugar with no aftertaste. Can't wait for it to go mainstream to be able to buy in our supermarkets.
1;We have had trouble in finding dog food for one of our small dogs who obviously has a very sensitive stomach.  We have tried several kinds of dog food for her and Newman's Own Organic seems to be agreeing with her. So we will continue purchasing this product through Amazon as long as it does.
1;We have been feeding our dog Newman's Own since she was very young.  She was a finiky eater and I was a determined owner who insisted on organic food.  Both of our needs were fulfilled when we found this great product.  It's the only dog food that she has eaten and she is going to be 9 years old next month.  The only reason she ever has gone to the vet is for her shots.  I highly recommend this food....I am SOOO glad amazon carries it now because we had to drive quite a distance to buy it before at a organic pet shop.....
1;"""I switched my dog to this food and watching him truly enjoy eating and the taste of his food is worth anything.  He has eaten Precise foundation formula for the almost two years since I adopted him.  He often goes off his food and/or vomits from time to time.  I've tried switching him to Wellness and Blue Buffalo with no positive results.  I can't tell you the immediate difference in him from the first time he ate the Newman's...and he looks forward to every meal"
1;We've originally bought this as our dog's first food and then switched to Wellness. Dog had runs for a few weeks hoping it would go away then went back to Newman's own and now our dog feels a lot better. Never switched his food ever again.
1;I have two English bull terrier with bad allergies. One of which is very picky and quickly stopped eating any type of dog food that I bought. They have been eating Newman's advanced dog formula for active or senior dogs for 18 months now and have not tired of it. Their skin and mobility has improved and they love it. I buy it by subscription so we never have to worry about running out and it is the cheaper way to purchase. My local stores only sell small bags which is an expensive way to buy.
1;I feed my 10 year old toy breed this food and she hasn't complained yet.  Was feeding her Eukanuba her whole life before the dog food scare.  Switched then to only organic brands like Wellness.  This product has been the best deal on organic dog food I have found and with the subscribe and save...perfect!!
1;"""This is a great product. Very comforting for owners that it is all natural (and mostly organic) with no by products and preservatives.<br /><br />We gave our dog (a 7 year old lab mix) PetPromise before. After the transition it took a couple of days for her to get used to it"
1;"""I adopted a rescue dog who had an allergy to corn. I checked every bag in local stores but all main fillers were corn. I thought I would have to drive to nearest pet store (120 mile round trip)to find a corn free dog food. Then I found this brand on Amazon which listed all the ingretents. No corn! My dog loves it so much"
1;"""I've always given my dog what I thought was high quality dog food since she was a puppy.  After the pet food issues of a few years ago I switched to only organic dog food for her.  Since she is only 10 lbs the price difference isn't too bad.  I am a free feeder which isn't ideal but means my dog basically has access to food any time she wants it.  Because of this she only gets really excited when  people  food is offered to her.  Well when I open this bag she comes over and eats asap.  Good enough for me!"""
1;This large bag of dry pet food is highly recommended for you adult dog. It's also worth purchasing this larger sized bag (or get two of them at once) in order to stock up on this food for a greater length of time.
1;"""I signed up for the monthly subscription for this item. The price is great especially without having to pay shipping charges. I love the fact that I can manage the subscription by skipping a month or ordering it earlier than scheduled. Amazon has been excellent getting my shipments out on a timely manner. <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK33C6 >Newman's Own� Organics Adult Dog Food Chicken & Rice Formula"
1;"""I originally bought this as a replacement for Science Diet's I/D as it was always much more expensive than anything else out there. I/D was also more expensive than Newman's at my local vet's office. I have had a ton of issues getting my dog to accept other dog foods in the past. We tried pretty much every brand that you can buy in pet shops and always had problems with my dog scratching or having her ears get bright red. We found out the problem after one of the cases where she almost went into renal failure after eating her Milkbone treats. We needed something organic without a lot of beef in it. While this one does have some bi-product for protein"
1;"""I adopted my dog about 6 months ago and he had digestive problems that the vet could find no cause for. He would get diarrhea with mucous in stools regularly. His stools would vary from constipated to unformed soft stool. I decided to switch him to a better quality food and did a lot of research. Newman's Own had all the qualities I was looking for"
1;"""I subscribe to the 12.5 lb bag of Advanced Dog Formula for Active or Senior Dogs - it's a great value. We have a small border collie mix and she absolutely loves this food. I feed it to her in a <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006G54OU >Buster Food Cube Large Size (Colors May Vary)</a> and she can't wait for mealtime every day!<br /><br />We got her from the shelter where she was on Science Diet. She had a ton of skin issues (formerly had fleas"
1;"""since we began using this several years ago our senior dogs raely need to visit the vet. When we were feeding a well know premium petstore brand  we were there at least 1 time every six weeks. they love the taste of newmans it keeps their tummy in tip top shape. NO more food alergies. No more vomiting"
1;"""I switched my mini-Schauzers over to Newman's Own Organics a month ago when they came off of their puppy chow.  I've been looking for a good quality dog food (rated 4 stars by dogfoodadvisor.com) without going into debt purchasing it!  I was feeding them a different brand that was  breed-specific  food"
1;My cocker puppy 4 mos threw up castor and poullex and Natural balance and had loose motions. SO i tried this and he did great ! even the red streaking from his eyes have almost cleared up after a month along with similasan eye drops. which is great.
1;"""My new Yorkie came from a puppy mill. She was clean and well groomed. She was not ever in a house. When I got her home she was so scared and nervous from the strange surroundings. She would not eat or drink and had horrible watery mucous bowel movements. After a visit to the vet that showed no  parasites we put on the bland diet. I researched organic dog food and was very impressed with the reviews of this food. No one in my area"
1;"""I have been feeding this to my Standard Poodle for quite some time. It was recommended by a local dog day care/grooming/training center called Great Dog Shoppe in Seattle. They are VERY specific about which foods they suggest and sell. It must meet certain standards of nutrition or it's no-go. My poodle loves it"
1;"""I have a 10 year old Aussie shep/heeler mix with chronic skin allergies -- I tried him on every premium dog food including grain free protein only formulas -- and none helped.  Other organic dog food also make him itch miserably.  But on the Newman's Own he's stopped the itching and shedding"
1;"""I bought this for my miniature schnauzer who is about 17 pounds and I feed her a heaping cup everyday. Also sprinkled on top is glucosamine pills <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028ZLL8 >Nutramax Cosequin Regular Strength Capsules - 180 Count</a>"
1;"""It's all organic and it's on PETA's (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) list of  CRUELTY-FREE  brands.  Did you know that the leading brands of dog foods conduct horrible and cruel tests on laboratory dogs?  Plus it is delivered to my door and no shipping charge (Super Saver Shipping)"
1;"""I have a two-year old Jack Russell Terrier and she loves Newman's Own Dog Food! She ate Beneful for a year before switching. This goes down much easier. She doesn't each eat it  just because she's hungry "
1;My two small dogs took to the food immediately so well in fact I have had to move up the subscription for the 12 pound bag. Since they are young its not immediate if they look healthier or bouncier as they seem to be that way all the time. What I have noticed is there business is allot more controlled and any problems such as regurgitation which I had in past products have gone away. If your a prime member I would suggest setting up a subscription and be rid of of the chore of last minute runs to buy dog food and also know you are giving your pets a quality tier of dog food.
1;The best dog food ever for my dog. He has a sensitive stomach and not only does he love it but it totaly agrees with him.  My vet also feels it's a great product. Even my dogs teeth are cleaner since being on it.
1;My dog loved this food and he was a very picky eater.  I felt I was giving him healthy food with no fillers.  I also loved the convinence of having it sent to the house monthly.  Not having to shop and drag a big weightly item home was great.
1;"""My Dog is really  Picky  when it comes to his food and I usually have to mix his old with his new for a few days  Until he will eat  his new food. I opened the bag when my Order arrived and gave my dog a taste...... He loved his new food & this is his second 15 pound bag!"""
1;I adopted a dog from rescue shelter who has an allergy to corn. I live in a small town and found no dog food that didn't contain mainly corn. This was perfect and my new pet is doing very well on it and loves it. It's an added bonus that it comes straight to my door.
1;My dog is allergic to most dog food.  I have used Newman's Own  dog food  for several years now and I am quite happy with it.  I live in a small town that is 60 miles away from the nearest big city and I am unable to obtain the dog food locally.  It is a real convenience for me to buy this from Amazon and the price is equitable.
1;"""We were looking for an organic food after the melamine poisoning of pet food debacle. Newman's Own dry foods for cats and dogs are manufactured in the US per their corporate veterinarian. Newman's Own is up front about their ingredients. For an organic food it is affordable. Also it has been great at keeping skin issues under control. Lastly Newman's Own is listed as a  More Responsible Pet Food Company  on several websites."""
1;"""Our family loves these tasty and healthy sesame honey almonds by Trader Joe's.  You get the crunchy flavor of the sesame seeds combined with the subtle sweetness of the honey and almond flavoring.  Wow--it's a great snack that you feel good while eating.  It is my favorite of Trader Joe's almond snacks.  Almonds are good for you and a handful of these in the morning with a fruit smoothie or as a snack at lunch is a great way to get protein"
1;I gave this a try when it was on special and I totally Love this product Iam as fussy coffee drinker this product is just a lovely as those higher priced coffee's that tend to break my bank account ..GIVE it a TRY
1;I'd rank Toffifay as tied with Ferrero Rocher for the greatest chocolate candy ever. Sadly Toffifay is impossible to find depending on where you live. I thought ordering 24 packs would be overkill but I'm going through these things like nobody's business. At this rate I'll have to tack on an extra mile onto my daily running regimen
1;This candy has gotten harder and harder to find.  It was down to a couple convienence stores in my area that sold it and they stopped.  Now a year later I typed in Toffifay into Bing and up pops Amazon.  Great price for a great candy and I'm well stocked up for the next 6 months.  The hard part is not eating it all the first week!
1;I am from Colombia and I was looking for a coffee that tasted like back home. Everyday when I make coffee and the aroma is in the whole kitchen .. It feels like home and it tastes just like it. I love this coffee.
1;"""I used it for a sinus infection where I lost my voice completely and had a sore throat. I found this product on yelp and went to an herbal Asian store in Chinatown in Phila. I only paid $2.50! the only difference is that I didn't get tea bags they were dissoluble cubes you place in the hot water. It worked great. It took a few hours to work but it worked!. The next day I had my voice back completely and no sore throat. One night I woke up from terrible post nasal drip cough"
1;Its allergy season which usually means large amounts of sudafed.  I don't particularly like the side affects of sudafed and have tried tons of different decongestants.  This is the first thing other than sudafed to actually work!  I have not tried it during a sinus migraine yet but for moderate congestion it works wonders.  Smells a bit off but the taste is just fine.  Make sure to seep it for 10-15 mins or it won't work.  Give it about 10-20 mins to kick in.  Seems to last for 3-4 hrs.  No side affects that I can tell.  So glad to be rid of the racing heart side affect and dry mouth/ sore throat that comes with sudafed.  It works great paired with a sinus rinse or netty pot.
1;I bought this tea based upon some research I had done into the ingredients and by reading the reviews posted here.  This tea has a wonderful flavor and smell.  I have enjoyed it very much and it helps me at bedtime with my sinus issues.  Great Stuff!
1;"""I am so please that I was able to get the tea from Amazon.  I was pleased with the service.  Sinus Buster Herbal Tea is very helpful and it gives me great relief with my allergy.<br /><br />I have been suffered with Hay Fever Allergy for the past 20 years or more.  First time I find a medication which is natural and no side affects compare to other medication for allergy.<br /><br />I discovered the tea at a farm market in PA on a bus ride with my church.  At first I was hesitated to purchase the tea"
1;"""I absolutely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from sinus headaches.  My brother had given me a couple of bags to try a few months ago. In the past I have had serious sinus headaches.  After drinking this tea"
1;"""I learned about these from a co-worker after he made a bulk purhcase of several kinds of beef sticks a year ago.  He spread them around and so I got to sample a variety: I've ordered the Honey Stung four times since then. Two other co-workers have also ordered them on several occassions this past year and they're  believers  too.  Additionally"
1;"""I like this product very much. The Honey flavor makes them taste very good and they are bigger and thicker than most others I've seen. The saddlebag package is ingenious. why open and expose to the air all 100 when you only have to open half at a time. leave one half (50) completely sealed. One package of 100 thick beef sticks can sustain someone for a very long time. Use for emergency shelters"
1;I love this product and order it quite often for my big boys to take hunting. Just wish the seller would take the time and money to change the label to say Mild instead of spicy. It isnt spicy and they have at least put a sticker on the package but have not changed the discription on line so I thought I was actually purchasing spicy this time. Still a wonderful product.
1;Beef sticks and honey - what a great combination! The Ole Smokies beef sticks are full of flavor. Adding honey gives them a little twist of sweetness that just puts them over the top. The Honey Stung Ole' Smokies are always a favorite with our friends
1;"""I have now made a few of the Amazon wine kits. The Cornucopia are all fruity flavored sweet wines. Within a month of bottling the Pear Chablis our 30 bottles is down to 6 remaining. We have given as gifts and taken to get togethers. My only negative comment is that the starting Specific Gravity is low therefore these are lower alcohol wines. I did add a couple cups of sugar to the fermenter at the beginning...but worried that adding too much sugar would throw off the flavor of the wine. Anyway"
1;I bought this kit and I have to say that it was a hit. It was originally bought for my wife but then she decided to trade off 15 of these for 15 of the White Zin that we were making for a friends wedding. At the wedding it went quick and many people were asking me to make it for them. MY answer was here is where you buy the kit and if you want to buy it and the bottles I would be happy to make it for you. I do not have a license to sell it since this is just a hobby for me.<br /> I did add one can of white grape concentrate after the F-pack was added and that added so much more flavor.<br /> I promise that you can't go wrong with this kit if you like a sweet chardonnay.
1;This is my 6th kit I have made and as usual it is simply amazing!!! I am truly hooked on all Amazon's wine kits as they have all turned out better then I have ever imagined for the price. i couldn't be happier with the results and will continue to purchase these kits to add to my wine cellar. I am in the process of fermenting the Barolo and am eagerly anticipating the end results.
1;"""The 6 hour power energy shot does just what it says.  A lot of times I only drink half the bottle to achieve the mental alertness that I look for.  It's one of the best energy shots out there when you figure in price"
1;"""I love these cookies. I am on the paleo diet right now and these cookies are what I look forward too. I do like the taste of the tropical one the best. They all have different taste but if you want something that is grain free and gluten free then this is the right place. I expected the taste to be different and it is. Other reviewers seem to expect them to taste like oreos or chips ahoy. Of course not.<br /><br />When I eat them"
1;i just started the paleo diet and i love it! lost 4 lbs in like a week! anyway i was so glad to find out there are paleo cookies out there and thank goddess they're good!! i loved the original and when they sent me them i got a sample of tropical and i loved that too! so i ordered the tropical and got a sample of rainforest! at first they're good but if you read the ingredients u'll see there is cayenne pepper in it and im really sensitive to hot spices and i could SOOO feel it on my tong! it was like an after taste. but if u enjoy a little fire with ur sweet u'll like rainforest flavor! really wanna try the alpine flavored ones they're a lot darker in color so it should be interesting :) good job caveman bakery! I LOVE YOU!
1;This is the best ever.  Just add HOT water and mix.  Yummy with anything can even add to cream sauces and soups.  Add some sausage and you are in Heaven.  Yummy Yum.  Cannot go wrong ordering this product.
1;my boys have been eating these for over 3 years now. Recently the box has been redesigned. I like it and it's much easier to open now. It used to have sharp edges and made it easy to get paper cuts. It seems the recipe has changed for the bar. it's softer than what it used to be. The boys still like it. They eat only this all day long if I let them.
1;"""I was so pleased with this purchase. A great value since I got them on a monthly sale!! I love to have these on hand for they come into play so nicely in so many recipes. Always a joy to have a good  crunch  in some recipes. One of my favorite ways to use this larger can is to wrap a piece of bacon around them and secure with a toothpick. Then I dip them in a Apricot Ginger marinade and put in the oven until the bacon is crisp. My family loves an appetizer dinner once in a while and this is one of their favorites. Be mindful that this is a larger can so have a couple of recipes in mind for them when opening"
1;"""Enfamil Premium Lipil Formula is the same as the previous flagship Mead Johnson formula--Enfamil Lipil--except that it has  prebiotics  added in.  Our son was on Enfamil Lipil from September 2007-September 2008.  He was breastfed and formula fed during this time.  Our daughter"
1;We had to move to formula when our baby was 8 weeks. We have found Enfamil Premium to mix easier than the regular Enfamil Lipil. Our baby has had no digestive issues from the formula. I love getting it in bulk from Amazon as it saves the weekly trip to the store for formula. The price (with free shipping) is comparable with local grocery stores in the Austin Area.
1;I have been buying  new Morning Graham Crackers since February of 2010. Never had a Problem with damage of the crackers in shipping .<br />Why Did Amazon Remove the Graham Crackers From Subscribe and Save?????  Why Did Amazon Remove The Graham Crackers From Prime ???The Crackers are a much Higher Price From a Third Party Seller. I will Purchase the Crackers From Whole Foods . Not Fair of Amazon to Take Away the Connivence of Ordering a Case
1;"""This soup is good. I really love this brand of soups..my favorite being the Chicken and Dumplings. Healthy Choice isn't always the best brand when it comes to frozen meals but for some reason they really knocked it out of the park with their soups. I love them"
1;"""This tea actually tastes the way a rose smells.  It's like sipping on roses when you drink it.  I'm glad it can be purchased on Amazon because I looked in every regular food store as well as the more unusual stores"
1;this is the best halal beef jerky i have ever tasted. also the company truly gives an Orthodox Muslim a good choice in buying because when you call them to ask about their slaughtering process they quickly give you the answer unlike other Muslim company's who try do deceive the consumer.
1;Never had jerky before because I've never seen a Halal version. Was a little apprehensive at first but found it highly addictive. Went through a whole bag in one sitting. I recommend all my curious Muslim brothers and sisters to try it.
1;"""I was reading a news story about how lab research suggest a thyme tincture to be one of the most effective ways to fight acne (better than a prescription). I got 5 quart jars (this amount is perfect for that many)"
1;I brought some of this back from a trip to Jamaica and wished I had bought it by the gallon.  It is very hard to find but WELL worth ordering in bulk!  It is a sweet but spicy sauce that takes me back to Jamaica with every taste.  I have attempted to duplicate it many times but can't seem to get it right.  I am ecstatic to finally have found a source.
1;"""What can I say about this flour that won't make it look like I was paid to say it?  I have been using this flour since I was diagnosed with Celiac disease six years ago. I have worked as a gluten free lifestyle coach for GF diagnosed people for years helping them to adjust to the diet and Pamela's flour is one of the first things I steer them to.  It is a great all-around gluten free flour.  It is not too light"
1;We go through Pamela's like crazy.  Fantastic for pancakes (we like to add a little vanilla to batter).  It also makes great chocolate chip cookies and banana bread.  The 25 lb bag is definately the best way to go value wise.
1;What's not to like about Pamela's baking mix? I use it as a base for a number of baked goods. I have made biscotti - and a wonderful Lemon Ricotta cake with Pamela's  to name just a  couple of things.<br /><br />I got a little carried away with the last purchase - I bought the 25 pound bag -which means I won't have to order it again for a year!<br /><br />For those that area curious about the Pamela's Baking Mix - it's a wonderful tasty base mix. The waffles and pancakes it makes are delightful - I really cannot say another bad about the baking mix nor Amazon for bringing the larger bag option to us - the consumer.
1;I've tried tons of GF pancake mixes.  I could choke on most of them or just decide not to ever eat pancakes again.  These are so moist and delicious.  My 92 year old grandmother was just diagnosed with celiac disease.  She loves them too.  My wife and children who are not GF also love them.<br />m
1;"""Erin Baker's products are a favorite for my family.  The breakfast cookie mini's are great for snacks & coffee breaks and especially good for traveling.<br />This is a denser product than a regular cookie"
1;These are excellent. They taste great and are just the right size.  Two can make an on the go breakfast that is tasty and good for you.  The larger size breakfast cookies are just too big. 2 of these are perfect.  My husband had gotten out of the habit of eating breakfast- too much trouble- but since I bought these he is good about grabbing one or two on the way out the door.
1;"""Just an outstanding product<br /><br />An authentic dulce de leche ranked number-one in Argentina for its exceptional richness and depth of flavor.<br /><br />Made at a small dairy outside of Buenos Aires.<br /><br />(note that the web page or supplier indicates  Made in Spain  but this product is clearly made in Argentina)"""
1;"""I bought this for my girlfriend as she had been having tummy issues and she absolutely loves it.  Now it seems assumed I will keep her in stock.  That alludes to a completely different product review.  The point is"
1;I wasn't much of a tea drinker until I bought a 'Breville' automatic tea maker and a bag of Tummy Tea Fennel for my wife. She started brewing the first pot of this new tea and did it ever smell great- a little like licorice. We both shared that pot and have been hooked ever since. This is one of those teas that makes you just feel warm and fuzzy all over. It is a feeling you do not forget.  If I was stranded on a desert island and could only have one tea this would be it.<br /><br />  For those who enjoy drinking tea I would encourage you to look into the 'Breville' tea maker. Produced by a German firm it is without a doubt an indispensible tool for brewing tea. The price for this mechanical marvel is a little high but believe me it is worth every penny.
1;"""I have 5 house cats.  One was recently diagnosed with diabetes.  We got his diabetes under control with insulin but I began researching diet information to help us.  All of my research led us to try Felidae grain free.  I spent two weeks carefully switching Louis (and the four girls) from dry Iams to Felidae.  I was immediately able to decrease his insulin and by the time I had him totally on Felidae we were able to discontinue insulin totally.  All with our veterinarian's supervision"
1;I have the coolest different cats ever-with some exotic in them-and this stuff is amazing and really they seem to love it! It does not make the poo smell bad and the digestive system of some of mine-do not tolerate much grain or gluten so that is VERY much a PLUS!  The price on amazon is better for a large-can (amount / per ounce) than i can find at local pet shops or stores.  So when you can get the free shipping it is REALLY awesome to have pet foods at your door-service too! I hope Amazon will just continue to make pet food / supplies to your home affordable and at a top price!  Sometimes though when i go to try to re order cannot find (the same deals)available.  So I just lurk and watch and wait sometimes til it is Offered again to make it affordable. Not sure why -that happens but i know i have to (watch it) to make sure i don't end up with a high shipping fee in my cart-prior to purchase.
1;"""I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the time.<br />I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods"
1;"""This Yuban DARK ROAST is outstanding.  It is smooth with a chocolaty taste.  I find it as good as any far more expensive coffees.  I would also recommend purchasing the 11-ounce cannisters because the coffee is freshest when you can pop open a new can and use it up without refrigerating or freezing it.<br /><br />I do not like many dark roasted coffees because I don't like the burnt taste.  Yuban DARK ROAST has NO burnt or bitter taste.  Definitely shun the regular roast for this one.<br /><br />Also"
1;"""My husband and I are always searching for better coffee...and seemingly there seems to be something wrong with them all! LOL I have finally decided that Yuban is without fail MY favorite coffee...it has no aftertaste"
1;We had not been able to find the Dark Roast Yuban in any of the stores recently. When I ordered this they gave me a date of receipt. It actually came two days earlier. My husband was so excited when he saw what I had ordered. Thanks for the quick service on a great product.
1;I tasted this snack at my local pub and found it tasty... much better than chips or other mixes. I was told it was sold in Sam's club and Wegman's for $18 per 30 0z container. Bought it from Utz in a 4 pack for $41.00.<br />Each piece has a different taste and texture...Could not ask for a more delicious snack or a better price. Thank you Utz!
1;"""I found this mix at the Ft Myer Commissary.  I looked for this product last time I visited the commissary and could not find it.  So here I am online looking and found it here.  I could eat this all day.  I've tried several different snack mixes"
1;"""I use this to grow my cat grass every month or so.  Now that it's spring I can find the terra cotta pots at the stores again.  I just keep two and alternate so he always has grass growing.  He loves it"
1;I wanted to grow some cat grass for my kitty to distract him from my other plants in the house. I planted them in a large window sill box with potting soil. I had a large bunch of grass in about a week. My cat loves it and it looks great in my kitchen.
1;Our cat loves to eat this grass and it was so easy to grow too. I have never been much into growing plants but this was easy and actually useful rather than just grow plants around the house. Recommended product.
1;My cats really love this 9 Lives Seafood and Poultry cat food.<br />They prefer this pate to the slices or chunks.<br />They are a perfect weight and have beautiful shiny coats<br />and lots of energy.<br />It is good quality food and is very fresh.
1;Out of all the granola bars that Bakery on Main makes my 2 year old loves these the most. Maybe it's because she can still get the taste of a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich but in a snack bar :) We always have to have a box of this flavor in the house.
1;This is my favorite granola bar! Being vegan and gluten-free is difficult when it comes to finding granola bars that meet my  needs. This one is absolutely delicious! I love the ingredients and all the strawberries throughout the whole bar.  Highly recommend!!!
1;My husband and I love this product because it is naturally sweet without the taste of artificial sweeteners.  Most peach flavored teas taste like sugar and artificial flavors but not this drink.  It is wonderfully watery to quench any thirst.  I only wish that Amazon would always sell it because we would buy it on a regular basis.
1;"""This is by far the best Kona Coffee I've had. I use to purchase Trader Joes Kona Coffee but for the last several months they haven't had any and I've been unable to locate Kona any where so I thought I'd try Amazon. I saw this and although the price is staggering"
1;My son was on vacation a couple of years ago and brought back Hawaii Roaster Kona Coffee. They have a different technique the way it is grown then most coffees. I thought I would check to see if it was on Amazon. This is the best tasting coffee I ever tasted.  Well worth the money.
1;This coffee has a smoother and milder taste than a dark roasted coffee.  I like to have this coffee and a dark roasted on alternate mornings.  The daily contrast in taste keeps me appreciating the delicious coffee favors of each type.
1;I must say that Vitakraft has put life back into my dog. He is old and Vitakraft offers him more vitamins and minerals than what he was getting from his food. Now he has more energy and begs for these choco drops.
1;"""A superior dog treat with a chocolate flavor. These drops are not toxic to dogs and are vitamin enriched. My dogs just love them.  My grandchildren ate few thinking they were  Hershey kisses !! The children's mother who is a Pharmacist stated that the drops were not toxic to children or dogs!! The  product is excellent"
1;"""But I'll give it a shot.  Wow.  So far I have only tried (and intend to try) the Key Lime Pie and the Mint Chocolate Chip but they are both amazing.  They key lime pie is incredibly tart and delicious but unfortunately the flavor only lasts about 10 seconds.  The Mint Chocolate Chip is also incredible and the flavor seems to last much longer (or at least"
1;"""I did NOT expect this gum to be more than just your typical  lime  flavored  candy  type taste. But I was floored. This gum literally tastes like key lime pie. I swear I can even taste a graham cracker crust. The flavor only lasts a short time"
1;"""I've tried Wrigley's Apple Pie flavor of their Dessert Delights chewing gum.  It tastes EXACTLY like apple pie.  I can't wait to try the key lime pie flavor!  Everyone who has posted a review here on Amazon says it tastes exactly like key lime pie!  Wrigley Chewing Gum Co. appears to have hit yet another one out of the ball park!  John V Karavitis"
1;"""the extra dessert delights sugargree key lime pie flavored gum is an amazingly limey mouth party.  it has a zesty tartness tempered with enough sweetness for balance.  having a piece of gum taste so much like a food is a little disorienting and while i did not really think i would end up looking like a lime (a la violet beauregard from willy wonka and the chocolate factory movie)"
1;"""I have a hard time finding this up in New England - so glad to see this product here.  This is my favorite product in my spice cabinet.  I have tried many other so-called  Cajun  spice blends and find that they are too salty (although this is salty too"
1;"""I originally discovered this years ago on vacation in southern Maryland. Since then it's always been in our cupboard. We came home to PA that year with three cans of it and then resupplied each summer. After a couple of years it became available in our area"
1;"""My 6-month-old is a fanatic for these flavors!  She gobbles them up and we can't load the spoon fast enough for her!  We introduce new foods every 3 days and we always get the interesting blends as well"
1;I love Earth's Best. My son eats almost all of the Earth's Best single and combination foods. This pack in particular has two of his dinner/lunch favorites: Summer Vegetable and Brown Rice and Lentil. Some of the dinners and a lot of the first purees are very runny so we mix with some cereal to thicken.
1;My little guy loves to try new foods..so this variety pack is great.<br /><br />Feeding organic is the way to go. We trust and love the earths best brand<br />Ther formula is great. Amazon.com seems to have the best price around i checked.<br /><br />It is great to get the auto ships of babyfood..less trips to the store for dad !
1;"""I wasn't sure what to expect from this Jelly Belly flavor. I have eaten  red apples  before but they were usually in a fruit. This was a candied bean with  red apple  flavors put inside. Despite the obvious witchcrafts"
1;"""I love these foods my first son devoured them happily and now my second son also loves them. This fruit mix has a great variety my sons both love the peach oatmeal banana best. Overall a great product high quality ingredients and they don't taste half bad"
1;I'm not the one who eats these so I can't give the best review but my son gobbles them up so I'll take that as a 5 star rating from him and I give it 5 stars since I know it's organic and I don't have to worry about what he's eating.  Now if I were to review his vegetables I might have to deduct a star for him but that's just because he doesn't seem to care for peas much.
1;"""I bought this for my 8 month old grandson to try.  He loves it!  I'm so pleased that I am ordering it for my infant great-niece and also for part of an all organic baby shower gift.  This food is inexpensive"
1;"""We just started using these and my 7-month old daughter really likes them. I've tried a couple of bites and they are tasty with good flavor combinations. I love that they are organic. My only complaint not specifically related to the product is that when I got mine in the mail"
1;I like this one better than all the other ones by Earths Best. The variety is good and my son seems to enjoy them all.<br /><br />If i am going away for a weekend this is perfect for feedings. It is packaged well and again the variety helps!
1;"""I was reading the other day about which items you shoud buy organic<br />and fruits and vegtables were the top of the list. So dahh..it dawns<br />on me what have I been feeding my baby ? We changed to Earths best<br />I feel better"

1;"""Coriander is a spice many people pass up or simply overlook and very rarely use except when they might make a corned beef brisket every so often. Sometimes you will find a bit of it in popular seasoning blends as well but it's usually a task to find just a small bottle of reasonably priced coriander in grocery stores which deters folks even more from experimenting with this terrifically tasty and fragrant spice. The Frontier coriander powder is wonderfully citrusy and robust"
1;"""I Love Basmati rice and to get the Organic is the Best.  This product is great tasting and the aroma was amazing!  The only reason that I won't purchase it again is:  the amount in the package is very little and for as much as I steam rice (for not only my kids and me but our French bulldogs) it is just Not enough for the price you have to pay.  Way too expensive.  So"
1;"""Here is a great way to get that tast of your childhood without all the sugar.<br />Even without blood sugar problems i want to cut back on any excess sugar.<br />This allows you to have a drink option (other than water) with a perky taste that<br />is low calorie and sugar free.<br /><br />Parents dont tell the kids and just serve it"
1;My entire family and my extended family (Cousins) love the entire product flavor line. Why have they taken this product out of the stores? Several large food store chains have taken the products off their shelves. Why?
1;We absolutely love the sugar free cherry Kool-Aid but have a very hard time finding it in stores.<br />When we discovered it on line we bought a bunch. It is a wonderful product! Hope they keep making it!<br />Delicious!
1;"""I am glad to be able to get one of my favorite drinks again.  For some reason a few years ago all of the stores in my area stopped carrying the sugar free KoolAid.  I like the new pouches that are in the tubes rather than the old tubs that were stacked"
1;"""I'm so glad I found this seller.  I just purchased my Keurig about a week ago and wanted to try some different flavors without committing to an entire box.  It was fun picking out all the flavors I wanted to try.  If you go over to her website"
1;This hit my sweet cravings perfectly. Definitely keeping this around. Yum.  I would definitely reccomend this to anyone wanting a quick snack that isn't a lot of calories.  Get the 94% fat free and it's only 100 calories.
1;"""I know the price varies for stage 1 foods but sometimes they are a lot cheaper on amazon then in the stores. I wasn't sure how many were in the package so I decided to just buy one.  There are 8 packs of 2 in this package so for the price"
1;These prunes saved so many of my baby's uncomfortable constipation days when he started on solids. The puree seems to be easier to consume than prune juice and we used to give it to our baby with yogurt. It soon became his favorite food and eased his symptoms.  I highly recommend this product to parents who are having a hard time with their babies' constipation.
1;I ordered these gummi bears after first trying them at Yogurtland. I was a little weary about ordering them because of the last two reviews. But I received a perfectly packaged item. They were not melted and didn't have a powdery texture to any of the gummi bears. They are my husband's favorite! We have been enjoying them since we received them and I'll be ordering more for events that are coming up.
1;I bought these to add to my Easter favors. I love the colors for that reason - basic and pastel - all of which are different flavors.  I didn't eat any myself but my friends who received the favors LOVED them!  I have a Prime Account so the gummies shipped very quickly so there was no melting going on (other reviews mentioned this).  Can't complain about the price for a 5 pound bag. It was a great deal and if I needed buy gummies in bulk again I would definitely buy these mini bears.
1;"""My boyfriend tried these gummy bears at our favorite frozen yogurt place and said they were the best gummy bears ever. I sued them to tell me what kind they were and found them on amazon. Then bought a 5 lb. bag of them for him haha. He wanted to go get frozen yogurt every other day just for the gummy bears. Anyway"
1;"""When we lived in CA we found this packaged brownie mix at our local chi-chi grocery store. On am impulse we purchased them and made them that night. AMAZINGLY good. Made with a cube of butter so be warned! YUMMMY! We went back and bought all the packages on the shelf and had the owners reorder many times for us. We have since moved to another state and have been trying to hunt these down. What a pleasure to find them on our old haunt Amazon. Order"
1;"""This is the only flavor my cat will eat.  She goes<br />crazy over this flavor.  I think because it is easy<br />to eat instead of a big chunk.  This looks like little<br />square slices of beef.  It smells good too.  Whenever<br />I open a can of this"
1;i had these on the airline and was so excited to not have the juice! i spent a month in italy and bought the olives w out juice but they seem to be hard to find in the USA...these are great since there is no juice! you can take them anywhere and not worry about the mess. i have been super happy with these. the flavor is pretty bold so I only eat 1-2 packs a week. I am going to try another flavor. i definitely recommend trying them! i love olives and this is a great idea
1;These olives are delicious! They are not overwhelmingly spicy.  My 8 year old son just ate an entire bag today for a snack.  They are not packed in juice but are moist and flavorful.  The bags are small enough that they are perfect for tossing in a lunch box or bag.  The calories listed for consuming the entire bag is only 100.
1;I got a case of Yuban cans from Amazon for an amazing price and now that I've been reintroduced to Yuban I'm sticking with it.  It's Colombian which is the coffee I prefer anyway but Yuban  must have a special formula for roasting and grinding that results in such excellent coffee.  Cans have the foil seals that you can peel off so you don't need to use a can opener and of course plastic lids to reseal.  Sniffing this coffee as I scoop it into my coffee maker is half the delight!!  Just so excellent and suits my tastes perfectly.  Buying the case is very convenient too!!!!
1;And a great price from amazon. My wife and I had dinner last night at a very high end restaurant and while everything was magnificent we both thought the coffee wasn't as good as our Yuban. I often wonder about Starbucks whose coffee I find undrinkable. My son says it's an acquired taste.
1;"""While working as a busboy in a high end resturant in the 1960's the resturant ran low on coffee. The manager sent me out to purchase YUBAN and only YUBAN saying it was the BEST! I have been drinking YUBAN for nearly 50 years and have always found it to be an exceptionally rich"
1;We've been drinking Yuban since 1979 and find this the most convenient way to get it. The price is great and it faithfully comes every month.  If we are having guests we can bump up the order.  Fantastic.
1;My husband and I recently moved here from Las Vegas to Steeler Nation. We have tried ever coffee on the shelves at all the supermarkets far and wide. We had been drinking Yuban for at least 10 years in Las Vegas. We called the District Manager for Kraft and found out that East Coast people don't like it or were not accustomed to it. West of the Mississippi is where you'll find it. So we had to order by the case load to satisfy our drinking pleasure. We got the best deal from<br />Amazon
1;We just love Yuban coffee and there is not a store where we live that has Yuban for sale.  I was delighted to discover that I could order it at Amazon.com by the case and always keep it in our pantry.  The only thing that could be any better would be that I could get Yuban beans so I could grind it myself as I make a pot of coffee.

I am so glad they can be purchased at Amazon. WARNING!!! They will ruin your desire for any other kind of sunflower seeds! GREAT!"""
1;These sunflowers seeds are of a great quality in every bag and the flavor of the Salt & Pepper is very bold.  I love these and the shipping service from the company has been great every time I have ordered.
1;"""I started getting this Folger's Half Caff coffee from Amazon because our small town stores don't always have it.  It comes in one pound vacuum sealed packs so it stays super fresh and it just fills my canister with one bag.  I like not having to get rid of all those plastic cans and I have it automatically sent to the door so I don't have to deal with those last minute trips to the store and find they are out. What a boon for rural"
1;I love this coffee!!  I had always mixed my decaf and regular to get 1/2 caffeine and now I can just buy it!!  Perfect amount for me. I enjoy the flavor of coffee!<br /><br />These vacuum sucked packages make it easy to store and use. It keeps the coffee fresh!!  I use then to refill another container and it works well for me!!
1;This is a terrific deal for a coffee lover that needs to cut back on his/her caffeine consumption.  Great tasting coffee and great deal.  Can spend over $5 for it at the grocery store.  I get mine by the subscription plan for a little over $4 plus no tax.
1;"""These crackers are certainly Crisp and Light. I am a low-carb eater and am happy to have something crunchy to munch on while watching my carbs (4 net carbs per cracker for Atkin's followers). If you are used to buying different flavors in the grocery store"
1;I love these so much I'd give them a 10-star.  I love them so much I have an Amazon subscription so they get mailed to me regularly.  I discovered them at Henry's but they're the only cracker on the shelf that are always sold out so when I saw the 10 pack here I was so happy.<br /><br />I eat them as a bread substitute with everything!  Can't go wrong with the calories and they don't have a strong flavor to mask the food so really they can be eaten however way you like.  Endless possibilities ...
1;"""I bought Wasa Crisp'n light crackers at my local supermarket yesterday because they were out of the Wasa rye crackers I usually by - that I really like. This was the last box and I am so happy I bought it!  I love these!  I enjoy most of the crackers by this company"
1;Since I am counting calories I find Wasa crisp'n light very tasty. You can eat three of them and feel like you are eating a lot more than you really are. I think the taste is great and have told all my friends about them.
1;This mix makes a gravy that taste like your good ole southern grandmother made the gravy. No more lumps and everyone thinks you made it from scratch. If you are thinking about it you have to try this. It is the best thing since the invetion of peanut butter
1;We love this stuff!!! I use it in my heat and eat breakfasts I make in advance so I don't have to cook every morning. My wife uses it for all kinds of recipes including just as really good gravy. We used to buy it all the time in California but it's not sold locally so we have to mail order it. MUCH less expensive from Amazon even over the manufacturer. For us the larger 4.5 Oz size is much more economical than the 2.5 Oz.
1;"""Absolutely amazing! This gravy wins over any other hands down for that good ole down home country taste!<br /><br />My neighbor & I frequently eat meals together. Yesterday I slow-cooked pork chops in about 3 cups of water"
1;The Southern Mills gravy is  a very satisfying gravy for an easy fast topping for either bisquits or hashbrown potatoes.<br /><br />The mix is easy to use and there are never any left overs. It hits the table and it is gone.... everyone seems to love it.
1;"""Really good quality tea.  Much superior to Twinings as tea.  The releasable plastic lined paper bag is much superior to the tins to keep excess air out.  This is important so the tea won't oxidize.  The tins look nice"
1;"""This product is delicious.  I will say this upfront - Thou semi messy (why not place the peanut butter in the center??? Instead on the back?)  The taste is great.  So great that I started to eat them all day -- not good as it ruins the enjoyment!!!<br /><br />These are actually so good I had to stop eating them!!! (I guess I over did it!!!)<br /><br />Value:  Excellent snack for everyone (all my friends love them) / family.<br /><br />Shipping:  Fast (as always with Amazon Prime membership - 2 days)<br /><br />Packaging:  6 Boxes Total - each contains 6 individually wrapped granola  thins   (1/3 of granola bar but flat with peanut butter on one side [seriously).<br /><br />Also do not ruin the granola as I did by eating every day!!! Also I notice to avoid mess just open with scissors!!! (pealing makes a mess!!!)<br /><br />[...]  Exclusively"""
1;These are so good and also healthy for a snack. Only 2 weight watcher point and 90 calories. When I was in Girl Scouts in the 60's there was a cookie like this Savannah it was an oatmeal crunchy sandwich cookie filled with peanut butter icing. The first bite I took I was back there. It was so good. I love that they are wrapped one to a pack and not double. I eat one everyday. They range from $2.98 to $3.89 a box in my area so the subscribe and save is the way to go. I tried the dark chocolate and they are also good but the memories the peanut butter ones bring with the flavor are my favorites.<br /><br />If you remember those cookies you will love these. If you like peanut butter and a healthy granola taste then hit the add to cart button fast. You will not regret it. YUMMMMMMMMMMY.
1;"""My husband & I have always bought Lucini vinegar's but in todays economy we try to look for a substitution since Lucini is expensive. I hit the jackpot right off with Cherry Republic's Sweet Cherry Balsamic. My husband & I use the cherry vinegar straight up on our salad as dressing or on a plate of fresh sliced tomatoes so it can draw out the true flavor. This vinegar is even sweet enough to sprinkle on a bowl of fresh sliced fruit for an extra kick but tart enough to use as basting on your fried chicken or fish. You cant go wrong with this vinegar for the price.....so we say bye-bye Lucini's Cherry Balsamic"
1;"""My mother and I have been trying to find Ground Celery Seed for some time now.  We have not been able to find it anywhere locally so I decided to purchase this product online.  Hesitant to purchase food items online"
1;"""I first learned bout Tiki Cat while searching for responsible and healthy food for my cats. I tried many different brands of cat food before Tiki Cat. I knew I had a hit when even my finiky cat came running for Tiki Cat food time. They seem to like the Sardines best"
1;"""I wanted to give homemade vanilla extract as gifts and was extremely satisfied with these beans. They made very high quality extract and were much cheaper than at local grocery or organic food stores. I was mildly concerned by the size"
1;"""What an incredible price for this many high-quality vanilla beans!!<br /><br />I split them with a friend of mine and we've both been making our own extract with delicious success.  At first I thought I might not be able to find use for all the beans"
1;I was very happy with the quick delivery of this product and how fresh the beans were.  I am looking forward to my homemade vanilla extract once it is done brewing.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.
1;Having been a professional cook for over 20 years I try to seek the best ingredients.  I was very pleased with this product.  From the moment you open the box you can smell them and they are still sealed in their bag.  They are very pliable unlike most of the big store ones and the seeds are very moist and easy to remove.  I needed to make a new batch of vanilla sugar and this was the first time I had to put some crackers in with it as the sugar was clumping within a week.  Should make an interesting cracker too.<br />John
1;I received my beans quickly and they smelled great!  I used all of them pretty quickly.  I purchased three 1.75 l bottles of vodka and split the beans evenly among them. They were plump and looked great.  I'm excited to give my homemade vanilla as Christmas gifts.
1;I received these wonderful beans today through Amazon.  I have not opened the vacuum sealed bag yet but the fragrance is divine.  They are about 6-3/4 inches long and plump and soft. It looks like there are maybe 60-70 beans.
1;"""Arrived very quickly and packaged safely.  They are vacuumed sealed and then put within a thick plastic ziplock bag.  Even with the packaging I could smell the vanilla when I opened my UPS box.  There are so many beans in here"
1;Great price.  Wonderful product.  Everything was as described.  Shipped quickly and was priced great as far as I can tell.  I use these to infuse vodka. (slice the beans down their length first).  Wonderful!
1;I was amazed with how fresh these are and there are so many in 1/2 a pound.  My only suggested would be if you have another person that loves them as much as you do you could split the cost and the beans.  I have so many left over beans I've been giving them away to grateful coworkers but what goes around comes around so here's to awesome ingredients!
1;Great vanilla beans at a great price.  I recieved about 60 beans in my pack.  They are plump and perfect.  When I've used them all up I will definitely be buying them again!  I almost didn't order them because of the reviews talking about the bad smell to them. I'm glad I didn't listen to them.  They smell like all of the other vanilla beans that I've bought.
1;This is the buy of a lifetime.  $25 for about 50 beans instead of $10 for 2!  And the flavor was great.  Made ice cream that everyone raved about.  I vacuum sealed portions for future use to keep them as fresh as possible.
1;Recieved Vanilla beans in a nice bundle in a ziploc bag.  The smell was wonderful even through the bag.  My husband and I used the Vanilla beans to make our own Vanilla extract.  The beans were moist and easy to work with.  We were very impressed and would definitely buy the vanilla beans again. Can't wait to see how the homemade vanilla extract turns out.
1;These will last a long time the way we use them but could not pass up the deal..came sealed and you could still smell the vanilla...stick one or 2 in your favorite vodka and wait a few weeks...we also make our own extract from them.
1;I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase. Vanilla beans are $5 - $9 a piece if you can find them in the store. These work out to about 51 cents a piece and they are fresher and better quality than the $5 ones. They also come vacuum sealed and a zip lock bag is included for storage after opening. Good job!
1;Can't be the price!  The beans have a strong aroma and tasted GREAT in creme brulee!  Just be sure to have an air-tight jar and a vacuum sealer isn't a bad idea either to keep them as long as possible.
1;I was very pleased when I got these vanilla beans. They were shipped in a timely manner and arrived vacuumed sealed. There was a mix of some very plump beans and a few that were thin. I was very happy with my purchase!
1;I LOVED this . The beans where fresh and the smell heavenly. I most definately would buy this again. The more expensive ones in the supermarket are dry and way over priced. These were very juicy. Loved it!!
1;I'm a profecinal cat trainer and have used several different treats including raw/freezdried raw  home made and comercial treats over the last 10 years. These treats take the cake and run. OMG all cats/ clients cats love these treats. They are the onlything i will ever use for training again. Best cat treat on the market. just dont forget to cut them up in little pieces there to big for your average house cat.<br /><br />If you have a finiky cat that dosnt like to eat. well here is your god send. Just crush some up and toss there food in it. Its a garanteed way to get them to start eating again. Dont use a ton since its high in fat.
1;"""I have been drinking oolong tea for several months now. I find it quite a nice morning beverage instead of coffee. It is also a great pick me up in the afternoon. One of the benefits of oolong tea is increased energy"
1;I would have to say that my dog is a picky eater. I have tried all types of different brands of food and finally found one that she loves. She also suffers from skin allergies and even though she is on meds I think this food has helped a bit with her dry skin. I only have one issue her breath smells really fishy after she eats but thats not even a big deal anymore. Also the price is cheaper than other online stores like petco and petsmart plus free delivery. All in all If Mona's happy so am I.
1;I moved to Las Vegas from San Jose last year and have been missing my Peet's Coffee Jasmine Downey Pearls tea.  When I saw this product I bought a shipment right away. I was not disappointed.  I love the individual silken sachets of Jasmine Tea pearls.  It is fragrant and wonderful tea. I will be buying it again.
1;"""La Tourangelle Roasted Walnut is the best tasting oil I have ever had. My old favorite was Avocado oil but this is even better and keeps longer. I pour it on everything. Make a great mayonnaise. Spinkle on baked stuffed shrimp or baked fish. Drizzled on steak or chicken and as a topping for pasta and bruschetta with some garlic"
1;I ordered a set of three cans and they showed up yesterday in perfect condition (no dents).  So far I have made some boiled red potatoes and seasoned them with walnut oil and sea salt.  I also roasted some yukon gold potatoes and english squash with the oil and it turned out wonderful--the walnut oil gives it a great flavor.  I will be giving one can to my parents.  Since my mom is not a fan of olive oil it will give my dad a new flavor to play with in his cooking.
1;I love the walnut oil. It came in cans which i like a lot because you hardly see them any more. The walnut oil was better quality than any of the walnut oil I bought in my neighbourhood and cheaper even with the shipping charge. I recommend it to anyone.
1;"""One of my favorite salad recipes I make often calls for walnut oil.  I bought a small bottle from a local major grocery store and it was over $10 for about 6 ounces.  Steep!  I love walnuts so naturally I loved this oil from my very first taste.  But the price was not right so I searched on the Internet and found this.  I was a little reluctant to buy 3 cans as I thought they go rancid before I can finish but I am now on my last can.  I use it in place of EVOO to make other vinaigrettes too.  Or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and B&S (or seasons salt like Krazy Salt) over spring mix"
1;Love these crackers and all of the Dr Kracker products.  I use Subscribe and Save to save a little bit of money and to insure that I don't run out.  I pretty much eat one every day instead of bread.  My current favorite topping is goat cheese!
1;I like these crackers so much I just ordered a different flavor.  These are very crunchy and satisfying.  I put two crackers into a zip lock baggie.  Break them into bite sized pieces and this is my treat throughout the day and into the evening and they are very filling.  I do recommend them however I don't know how well they'd go over for those with dentures.  Because they are so crisp and because they have seeds of various sizes.  Very good find.  Love um.
1;These are delicious and filling. I first had them in Hawaii a few weeks ago but then couldn't find them when I got back home to Philly. Amazon had them and a good selection. If you are a seed and nut eater and like a crispy cracker you will love these. Enjoy!
1;"""I love these flatbreads. I smear mascarpone on them and then so many diffferent things on top of that to make a wonderful snack or lite meal. Their very crunchy and tasty. I watch my diet closely since I have Diabetes and these crackers are very low in Net Carbs in addition to tasting good. The other flavors are good too. I've twice now had to move up their delivery since I go thru them quick. You'll love em and will have fun trying different toppings for them. I really like them with Lox"
1;These are wonderful!  So crunchy and they're made from whole spelt as well as seeds and a big helping of tasty.<br /><br />I found them remarkably filling too.  They're nice and big.  It would be easy to make these the basis for a light meal adding just a few toppings.<br /><br />I ordered these sight unseen and never tasted so I had no preconceived notions.  I'm very pleased and will order these again.
1;This is the only oatmeal that my family will even consider eating.  I make it in the crock pot overnight and it is always ready when we are.  I use my small crock pot for the two of us.  I start with a 1/2 cup of oatmeal
1;We were introduced to McCANN's oatmeal a few years ago by close friends.  We were able to find it locally in a few stores near where we live.  However the these few stores gradually became fewer until the product was no longer available to us.  This left us with the internet as the only option for obtaining this product.  Hopefully this resource will not fade away.<br /><br />Joyce
1;Delighted with my first ever Irish Oats/Steel Cut.  As a Diabetic this should help me with my blood sugar -- natural carb with a slow release!<br /><br />Cook up a batch in the slow cooker and use left overs (microwave) for a couple of days.  Great . . . will be purchasing more.<br /><br />Thanks McCann's and Amazon.
1;I have been having Quaker Oatmeal for yesrs until trying this today! The texture and the taste are completely different from the pressed oat. It worths cooking for half hour. My son love it at the first bite! My 8-month-old baby is also love it! I uaually cook the portion which will be enough for 2~3 days. Drop one spoon or two into the worm milk every morning to make my breakfast much more healthier! This one is so good that it will be hard for me to go back to pressed oatmeal.....
1;"""I really like this product to add to water so that I don't have to drink so much Gatorade and sweetened/acidic beverages.  I use this because I have very low sodium levels and my doctors do not want me drinking  free water .<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that it didn't arrive when promised and I didn't have it in time to take with me on vacation."""
1;I ordered these for my upcoming wedding candy buffet. I am doing all navy and white and these go perfectly. They are individually wrapped and a true navy color. The packaging was great. Each lollipop is wrapped in bubble wrap. Love them!
1;"""This jar of baby food has 7 GRAMS of FAT and 110 calories - thats triple the fat and double the calories of most baby food!  I highly recommend for babies needing to put on some lbs - as well as picky eaters.  I have to offer my son a variety of 7-8 foods each meal (cheese"
1;My picky eater LOVES this flavor.  Each jar is 110 calories & 5 grams of fat so this momma LOVES this flavor as well.  I'm ordering more because it's the one flavor (besides green beans) that I know my son will eat.
1;We live in the middle of nowhere so we end up ordering a lot of spices etc. that can't be found locally.  This gives great chipotle taste with just a little sprinkled on.  I'm going to order a few more of these because I never want to run out of it.
1;"""Old Mother Hubbard biscuits (we've tried these as well as the puppy variety) are the only true biscuits my dogs like! They would eat the whole bag if I let them. The only thing I don't like is they contain wheat"
1;I never drank coffee in my life - received a gift of Ghiradelli chocolate flavored coffee for Christmas - searched on line and found this Dark Chocolate Decadence. It is the absolute best - have it on bi-monthly subscription order now with Amazon. If you are a fan of dark chocolate - this is a wonderful coffee - very smooth with just a hint a dark chocolate in the background. Delicious sweetened with honey and milk. Also divine with Almond Milk or Vanilla Soy Milk.  Coffee Masters make wonderful coffee.
1;"""Old Mother Hubbard treats are the best and at a reasonable price. Their treats come in a lot of different sizes and flavors. They offer a variety of products that all dogs will love. My three black labs love the peanut butter and Bac'N Cheez."""
1;"""Sounds corny but oh so true.  The aroma is pungent with the savory smell of coffee and the sweetness of chocolate.  The chocolate flavor is rich yet delicate so it doesn't overwhelm.  I purchased four bags of the ground coffee first for my daughter.  She insisted I taste it even tho I don't like flavored coffee or 'dark' chocolate. I enjoyed it so much I took back a bag and purchased 4 bags of the whole beans to grind when needed for that added freshness.  While I will not drink flavored coffee all the time"
1;"""I have really fallen for flavored coffees and I consider these to be some of the best-- so much so that I'm on the regular shipment list now.  I'm sure I drink too much of this but I love the flavors.  Try it"
1;We tried all flavors for our cats and the rabbit was the apparent favorite for all of them. Took a recommendation from catinfo.org for this food as it is closest to the diet that a cat would naturally eat. Coats are softer and glossy. Energy levels seem to be up. Quite pleased with the results so far.
1;"""This product is excellent! I HIGHLY recommend it... It has the balances of nutrients I was looking for but also non GMO... The product shipped quickly and is very high quality hemp seed oil. I'm extremely impressed! I can't wait to buy my next supply because of all the benefits! I've already noticed a difference in how my skin behaves"
1;"""This has been a boon for my digestive system! I take 3 tablets twice daily -- morning (after breakfast) and evening (after dinner). I haven't had any problems whatsoever for at least the last couple of months of taking the Hemp Oil capsules! I plan to continue taking them for a long time into the future!<br /><br />BTW"
1;I purchased the hemp oil for my mom to help with pain relieve. The Omega oils are suppose to help with join movement and pain. I have noticed that when she takes the vitamin her pain is less than the times that we are out and she has to wait.
1;"""I like to chew gum and I also like my teeth.  I am also allergic to most artifical sweetners and it is getting more and more difficult to find sugar free gums that do not contain aspartame.  This is why I purchased this product in the first place.  I like the flavor and it lasts quite a long time.  The packets are the perfect size to fit in your pocket or purse.  I always have some on hand at work"
1;Very tasty gum and the xylitol is wonderful.  My youngest daughter's dentist recommneds that she chew xylitol gum 3 to 4 times each day to help prevent cavities.  Her baby teeth had a cavity in every tooth along with three crowns!!!!  Her adult teeth seem to be much more cavity resistent and I believe the gum is helping prevent the cavities.
1;"""I'm into maximizing health. I don't use any artificial sweeteners or refined sugars in any form. Xylichew was a great find because its ingredient list is actually safe. This is rare for a gum. The gum has a great taste"
1;"""I sampled this cake as offered from Biscoff 1 month ago and fell in love.  It is extremely moist and is most delicious when sliced thin to accompany a cup of coffee. The ingredients are perfectly blended as no one taste is overpowering"
1;Raw is eating from your Organic garden of fresh grown fruits and vegetables.It is also all the nuts growing from the mountains that surrounds us through out the land from the forest. Although grown from a tiny little seed that the sun and rain helps in growth it is our heavenly father our creator God who truly makes them grow and should be appreciated for his gift of life to us all and for our home the planet we call earth .<br />I used to be a true vegetarian then I went to only eating Poultry and some fish and eggs through out the years.Now I will eat vegetarian soup made with some beef stock but I don't care for the meat itself and no pork.<br />I am still Organic Alternative and Green but I am slowly trying to go back to being that true vegetarian that I used to be however going raw will take a some time because I have a little hard time chewing with my teeth like my friend but after I get my dentures I will be able to adjust into it .Right now I am canning for winter storage.I have dehydrated my whole garden into green super power food that I added to my barley greens. note if you choose to cook get the Fagor Pressure cooker caner That I got it helps make the meals go quicker and is a lot healthier than baking and Broiling or grilling and never fry food.<br />Well I will let you know how the canning turn out and one day I'd like to make home made all fruit yes that's right not jelly or jam.<br />Hi Again so far so good I have canned 4 pint jars of my home made spaghetti sauce with 4 of Chili and 4 vegetarian soups with 2 red cabbages and they sealed and are ready for winter when things get rough as around here it is hard to get organics so when I do I get all that I can like I just got up at the farmers market this late fall and then I either freeze them or can them and even dehydrate them.<br />So I will keep you up to date but I need to try and get some organic fruits and that is hard to get again around here.<br />well catch ya later as I never say goodbye!Just get this wonderful organic fruit nut and seed mix it has no preservatives and is delicious and affordable and if I can get it you can too. Just remember to soak the nuts and seeds because nature puts some  protective coating on it and they need to break down this to be edible and fit for human consumption.
1;Put two tablespoons. in a large cup of fresh coffee and you have a great coffee mocha.  I have recently tried several others that have been recommended and got great customer reviews online.  None are as good as this one.
1;This is the best hot chocolate next to Cadbury bought in Europe.  Our 13 yr old would never drink her chocolate milk until we switched to this (unfortunately we don't have a steady supply of Cadbury's).  It's great!
1;Found this product discounted at a good price at slickdeals.net for about $10.<br /><br />First time drinking this stuff since I bought it.  I was blown away at how awesome it taste.  This was my first time trying something other than the Nestle brand cocoa (other than the few times I ordered cocoa at a cafe).<br /><br />Has a nice blend of mocoa/cocoa and doesn't taste too sweet like what I'm used to with Nestle.<br /><br />Definitely giving this a thumbs up.
1;Premium Ghiradelli chocolate mixed with just a hit of coffee makes this a great drink.  I've gotten to where I add a heaping spoonful to my Starbucks coffee every morning.  It gives it an extra coffee flavor and the chocolate for Ghiradelli far exceeds the 'mocha' chocolate you get at most barista stands.
1;I use this product with my home brewed espresso and milk to make a mocha latte.  It's terrific!  I ordered on the auto ship plan through Amazon and save about a $1.50 per can over buying it locally.  Plus I get the added benefit of having it delivered to my door instead of having to drive to a specialty shop to get it!  Great product and great service.
1;"""I used to drink Ghirardelli Chocolate Mocha hot chocolate as a treat on weekend mornings when I was working.  I'm now retired and started drinking it every day.  I was afraid that I would get tired of it drinking it every day instead of just as a treat.  Well"
1;"""I've been a fan of Ghirardelli Triple Chocolate brownie mix for a long time. And I also like Ghirardelli chocolate candy. So when I came across this chocolate mocha hot cocoa mix I wanted to give it a try cause I love cocoa and coffee. I'm glad I bought it because this stuff is delicious. I love the combination of chocolate and coffee. The coffee in it is very subtle and definitely not overpowering. It's rich"
1;"""I made this for my 12 year old grandson.   Grandma this is the best hot chocolate I have ever had in my whole life!   You can guess what he got for Christmas.  It really has a wonderful flavor.  Top it off with whipped cream."""
1;"""Great product! Love making this during the fall and winter months because the smell goes through the entire house reminding me of Christmas. Taste great too especially when warm and with cream cheese. Have made it for co-workers who always rave about it. It's easy to make up"
1;"""These potato chips are probably the best chips I flavor ever have. The spicy barbecue is the perfect mix of flavors! I have had tons of these chips and still they never get old. It fits one person per bag.  After a few chips"
1;"""I just love this Chili--it is beefier/chunkier than other no-beans chilis and the blend of seasoning is simply outstanding--much more savory and less of an assault to the tastebuds than Hormel's in my opinion.  Goes great on a hot dog"
1;"""Arrowhead Mills Organic Savory Herb stuffing has a very nice blend of herbs for a flavor that compliments chicken and turkey. I especially appreciate the fact that there are no transfats used in this stuffing so I and my family can enjoy it without worry! The stuffing is very easy to prepare"
1;"""My daughter loved the little tin that came with her Adagio tea set so much that I got her a cannister of this for Christmas.  I think it will end up being a regular gift as we all love it so much.  It really is delicious"
1;This carrot juice is the best.  I've tried so many other brands and this is the tastiest.  We love the Carrot/orange and the Super Veggie too. It's healthy and great tasting...can't get better then that.
1;"""I purchased this product for my goats initially. I like to give a warm drink of molasses water to my does after they kid and I also give a tablespoon full to any goat that seems to be feeling poorly. It seems to give them a good boost when they most need it. I bought an extra bottle for the house because I have always loved a bit of molasses on my biscuits. Much of the molasses"
1;My cat suffers from bladder cysts frequently since i have used this now since november 2011 he has not had 1 attack of not being able to pass his urine. i place a few drops in his food every week. btw he does not like it but tolrates it. at first i had to use eye dropper and place a few drops in his mouth but after time he got used to it. a giant thank you this has saved me so much worry whether or not he will be ok.
1;"""Great meal replacement drink that tastes great!  You get plenty of protein and other vital nutrients.  I prepare one of these whenever I'm on the go and I won't have to worry about missing a meal.  The best bang for your buck"
1;So I was doing my daily grocery shopping on Amazon and I was like awwww yeah there are some Rice Krispie treats sure can just make them in the kitchen but then you have to clean the spoon and wash the stove and then find some saran wrap in the kitchen to keep them more yummy for the next days....instead order these its simple a nice size treat that will give you plenty of treats for one day...high five to snap crackle and pop you guys rule. have a nice day k
1;This product is perfect for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy. His stools are very regular and healthy. My Vet was very pleased to know I picked this product instead of a regular store brand. It's all natural and my puppy loves it. :)
1;"""I make a lot of bread.  My family's favorite is my focaccia.  I had been purchasing a very  well known  flour prior to trying this.  I am so happy I did try it.  I thought my italian breads could not get any better"
1;really not much I can say abut this soup mix it taste great to us. we always bought the canned stuff when making pot roasts or whatever. then tried this well we will never go back to canned again. well worth the money will be buying more.
1;I am very happy with this tea.  I hesitated to order because of price but it comes in a nice tin with 50 round tea bags.  It is great tasting.  I add ginger chips to it and it really is great when I have an upset stomach.  I just recently received my second order.
1;I bought two types of edible glitter to decorate a plain cake.  This one was by far the most stunning.  The other silver went on grey (not that appetizing) whereas this one had tonnes of sparkle and really made a statement.  Highly recommended.  Nice fast delivery too.
1;"""It's true you also need a decent scale (I used <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OKR89G >Jennings CJ300 300g X 0.1g Scale</a>).  I tried the Caviar Cointreau recipe [...] and everything worked perfectly on the first try (it's fast too - under 20 minutes & I'm sure faster once you get the hang of it).  It's fun & very easy to make (a juice recipe would be a really fun way to do an edible chemistry experiment with kids).  The kit comes with large enough samples that it looks like it'll be good for 40+ uses."""
1;"""These chips are some of the best I've had--ever! They're so good I dare say that they're addictive from the very first time you try a few. The taste of the salsa is delicious and the fresh chips go with lots of other foods.<br /><br />The main ingredient is whole grain brown rice"
1;I LOVE these chips.  They are addictive...it's hard to just eat a few.  I tried the Chili flavor that has great reviews and I don't think they compare to the Salsa Fresca.  If you like a chip with a little kick...these are perfect.
1;These are great chips.  I have tried both the Salsa Fresca and Sweet Chili and love them both (if I had to choose one over the other would take the Salsa Fresca - just my personal preference).  Will be trying the Sea Salt in the near future.<br /><br />Can't go wrong with these chips!
1;I have been so called a hazelnut coffee freak for about 10 years and I have to say that I finaly found the match to the hazelnut coffee my father in law offered me whenever I was over visiting. He has passed away so I can not say if it was from Coffee Bean Direct. But darn it. It sure taste just like what he brewed up. Thanks you for the good cup of coffee and at a reasonable price. I got this page book marked for later orders. TLA
1;This coffee is good. I have tried a lot of hazelnut coffees and this is one of the best I got from amazon. It has a darker and richer flavor than most hazelnut coffee. It was fresh and tasty and the price was great at about $6 per pound with subscribe and save. I will order it again
1;"""Anyone who knows Yaucono will like the  new  packaging of mylar-laminated plastic.  I wonder how long they packaged in layers of paper?<br /><br />If you have not had this very rich Puerto Rican coffee"
1;Oetker products are always the best. I've used them for years because they have unique items that are tasty and easy to prepare. You absolutly cannot go wrong with this Creme Brulee. Why spend a ton of money at a restaurant when you can serve it by candlelight at home?
1;Have you ever try bbq chicken wings?<br />Use this glase and it would be delicious.<br />I used it a lot but usually bought it in super market. today I didn't find it there so I came online and order more here price is much better here.
1;I HAD USED AND COME TO LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND SUDDENLY COULD NOT FIND IT IN STORES NEAR ME. I CAME TO AMAZON AND THERE IT WAS! I COULD NOT GET MY CARD OUT QUICK ENOUGH! I SHARE WITH MY DAUGHTER WHO ALSO CAN'T FIND THIS ITEM LOCALLY.<br />THANKS AMAZON!!!!
1;This is the best coating/glaze to help make BBQ Chicken. I never can find it is the stores so I always buy it here and it is so much cheaper then a store. I pour it in a pie pan roll the chicken in it then bake. After I roll all the chicken I put the remaining glaze in a Zip Lock gallon bag and place in the freezer till the next time. Sometimes I mix the glaze with plain Chicken Shake n Bake for a crunchy BBQ coating.
1;We live in Tucson AZ and all of a sudden we can't find this one product anywhere in Tucson. I makes the chicken so juicy and tender and the flavor is beyond compare. So happy to be able to purchase some and looking forward to buying more!!!!
1;They stopped selling this at Walmart which made me sad but then I found it on amazon which made me glad. You have to buy in bulk but (going by the ones that I received) they don't expire for over a year so as long as you store it correctly you should be able to buy in bulk even if it's a small household like mine.
1;"""I had not been able to find Kraft Shake 'n Bake at the two (2)grocery stores where I shop.I was so glad to find this product available through Amazon.com. It was easy to order and was delivered very quickly. Great service.<br /><br />Thanks"
1;"""I remember the old days of having shake and bake BBQ ( I had a mother that was raising 5 girls alone). Chicken and the S & B were cheap to buy in these days and we ate it a lot.<br /><br />I never thought those memories could be recreated through smell and taste again"
1;"""Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying"
1;at it's best.  I have been drinking this tea since high school and the flavor has not wavered.  I've tried plain chamomile and it didn't make the cut. Nothing beats a cup or two of Sleepy Time before bed as it calms the nerves and settles the tummy.  What a perfect way to drift off into slumber !
1;Just 1 cup in the evening caps off my day and gets me relaxed and is a permanent part of my bedtime prep.  This CS Sleepytime Tea is my absolute FAVORITE evening tea ritual!  I think it is the wonderful flavor of camomile plus the spearmint that adds that extra something refreshing...ahhhh...(sigh)...big yawn...I'm toddling off to sleep now........  P.S.  I also love a cup anytime I'm feeling somewhat stressed and especially whenever I need to wind down like after a long time on the computer or after stressful shopping trips.  Take a cup and you'll really be in a mellow place.
1;We make most of our tea from loose leaf in a press pot. Sleepytime is the lone exception. We've been drinking this tea for many years now and it still rates among our very favorites. It's the perfect blend of camomile and mint. And you gotta love the bear.
1;"""I have been purchasing and drinking this tea for years.In fact since Mo Siegel used to advertise it on TV..now that is a long time ago. It really helps calm frazzled adults as well as hyper children before bed. But what is more share worthy is the fact that it is a great tea for children that suffer from motion sickness.<br /> Our oldest daughter used to be car sick all the time. We carried an endless supply of  baggies  for her as she would 8 out of 10 times relieve herself when commuting back and forth to school.<br /> We discovered that this tea"
1;This product is so great.  My daughter who is extremely pick loves it and she is also gluten free!!  so she can actually have this!!!!!<br />Not bad for 100 calories per serving!!!!!<br />This will be a great dish to take for Thanksgiving dinner.
1;"""Our daughter was very unhappy because she could not find Chi-Chi's Sweet Corn Cake Mix in her grocery stores.  Thanks to Amazon.com the  fix  was easy.  We had Corn Cake while dining on Lake Powell.  Heard the grand kids were enjoying more Chi-Chi's Corn Cake last night.  Thank you!  SR"""
1;"""Chi-Chi's sweet corn cake is awesome.  The stores in our area stopped stocking this item.  SO HAPPY to have found it on Amazon.com.  No other corn bread/cake mix comes close to being as good as this.  It goes great with taco's"
1;Great for a snack (I eat a 2500 calorie/day diet)... I eat this between lunch and work and it hits the spot.  An entire bowl is 400 calories.  Arrived on time and its easier and cheaper than buying in bulk at ACME or other such (not costco but i dont have my own member card)
1;We've been trying various rices including Aquarello Carnaroli and this Vialone Nano is by far the best. It's very forgiving of lapses in technique and produced the creamiest risotto of the five brands of rice we've tried.<br /><br />Be sure to have an airtight container to store the unused rice from each package - the vacuum pack plastic is too stiff to close well.
1;"""My dog is simply crazy about these treats. But what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well. Since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi-long lasting morsel of enjoyment. In additon to that"
1;"""Looking for a good tasting jumbo sunflower seed that is not too salty and has an outstanding flavor?  Then these are for you!<br /><br />They have an awesome flavor are jumbo size and the price won't hurt your pocketbook.  I would recommend them to anyone.  Unfortunately they are hard to find and when you do find some they fly off the shelf"
1;"""The seeds are large and roasted perfectly. I lived in Upstate NY near Buffalo when the Buffalo wings phenomenon started and have been eating them ever since. These seeds don't even have the faintest resemblance to Buffalo wings. If you are looking for that taste don't buy them.  If you are looking for a great spicy ranch taste then these are for you.  The only flavored seeds available near me are the plain ranch. They are ok"
1;"""I was just a little wary ordering this because of the other reviews that said it was super salty and way too tough. But I gave it a shot anyway. I don't know if it was because I ordered a different flavor(Teriyaki) or if I just got lucky. Nonetheless"
1;"""we had been looking for King B brand jerky for months before contacting Jack Links to find out what happened.  They informed us that their Smokehouse brand was indeed new branding for the King B products.  With speculation on them keeping the same recipe"
1;This is for all the beef jerky lovers out there. If you like jerky this is the best tasting stuff that Ive found anywhere. All of the flavors are great. The black peppered in my opinion is the best and the wood smoked is a little dry but still good. I would recommend it to anybody.
1;I love lemon pepper--I was amazed with this one--large grain and fresh.  Very large jar that delighted me because I use this in nearly everything.  Good tight jar to keep it fresh.  Very inexpensive.  Good buy for home cooks.
1;I bought this along with the easy freeze ice cube trays for my two dogs. My vet put my lab on a diet so I have been looking for low calories treats to feed him for his evening snack. Each packet is only 30 calories and will fill one easy freeze ice cube tray (six large ice cubes for the extra large size). One packet will also fill my labs kongxl and my terriers Kong medium. They love it and make sure they lick their Kong's clean without getting bored with it. Overall a great snack!
1;Just right for making dan dan noodles and other delicious recipes.  Glad to have this in my pantry.  Flavorful vinegar will be useful for various dishes.  Product delivery was great - just as expected.
1;This is my cat's third favorite food.  It's great stuff - the gravy is so very thick and the food looks like bits of steak slicked off for your friend.  My cat licks the bowl clean every time and wants more.  They should send me discounts for as much of this stuff I buy.  I buy it by the case if that gives you some idea!
1;I bought this product because it looked good not knowing if it would taste as good as it looked. Well it finally showed up by USPS well packaged. It's soft smells great and tastes even better. You won't be disappointed. I've already eaten five strips.
1;I am always on the  lookout for good old fashioned candy. Funny I do not even have a sweet tooth. However I really appreciate a quality candy. I picked up one these purely for the fantastic packing they come in. After just one taste it was obvious that the company has put love and care into producing these candies.  If you are looking for unique smooth and delicious old fashion candy look no further. Highly recommended.
1;Never gave much thought to this treat until Marshawn Lynch came to town...Awesome have a big ole candy dispenser at work with a big Seahawks sticker on it...Now we have Matt Flynn beast-mode cajun style...
1;My title was my reaction when I first opened the box it came in.  I didn't really plan on eating the whole bag since they are mostly gonna be used as reinforcement to get my kids potty trained.  My two year old girl doesn't really care so much but they work wonders for my four year old with autism.  I give her one after she potties and washes her hands and she couldn't be happier.  I do find myself reaching in and getting handfuls at times but I try not to go overboard.  If you love Skittles than this bag will probably be good for you but if you are just a casual candy eater than maybe not.
1;So this bag of skittles is really worth it. Comes with a load of skittles filled too the top of the bag. Skittles is my favorite candy now I order the 3.5lb all the time. Its enough to share and still have a lot left over
1;Ordered this goat cheese and it is just fantastic! I can't digest cow milk so finding these goat cheeses was a great treat! I would order them again they are that delicious! Looks spectacular on a cheese platter with fruit and selected crackers.
1;I agree with everything that the previous reviewer wrote in their review.  I gave the cookies a rating of 5 stars though because i havent eaten a cookie in about 4 years without getting sick.  This is because I have severe allergies to wheat and soy.  Pretty much every cookie you will find in a normal grocery store will have one if not both of these ingrediants.  So when I found Nana's cookies I was as happy as can be.  Yes the texture is different than a wheat cookie but it's better than going without cookies.  It also doesnt hurt that these cookies are delicious.  If you are like me and have a very limited diet these cookies are  a very welcome addition to that diet.
1;My daughter who is type 1 diabetic and has Celiac loves these cookies. Have had a hard time finding them in the local health food stores so was so happy to discover them on Amazon so bought 2 cases of them so now there is enough for the whole family.
1;My kids love these and I feel good about giving them to them. They're all natural and sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar. We like to pop them in the microwave for about 10 seconds - then they taste like fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookies. Yum.
1;"""Nana's cookies are good eaten plain.  They are a bit crumbly compared to cookies made with wheat flour.<br /><br />The cookies are individually packaged.  I find it better to cut the plastic open with scissors to avoid breaking the cookies.<br /><br />If you want the cookies crumbled"
1;These are the best!  What a wonderful way to provide a treat for yourself and your kids knowing how healthy and pure they are.  The taste is excellant and satisfies that sweet tooth.  Highly recommend that you try these.
1;The berry vanilla is one of my favorite from Nana's.  I also like the chocolate munch when I am wanting something with a chocolate flavor.  They are dry amd crumble.  That doesn't bother me.  I have been gluten-free for five years and have tried near everything.  Nana's has become part of my weekly grocery list.  They are easy to take on the go.  I think these would be great for parents with allergic children because they are packaged for on the go.  It can be frustrating to be out and you suddenly get hungry and there is nothing gluten-free to be found.
1;we have a two and four-year-old and they enjoy these cookies.<br />Good tasting<br />very convenient packaging ( individually wrapped)  Great for stuffing in glove compartment for emergencies.<br /><br />the right size for our kids<br />No bad stuff<br />no complaints.
1;"""I got disgusted with the garlic powder sold in bulk at health food stores and natural food groceries.  It rarely has much garlic flavor and was way too hot and the quality was very inconsistent at stores that did sometimes sell something good.<br /><br />I'm now half way through my second jar of Tone's"
1;I got this product a while back. It was very delicious. I love trying to cook Korean food. I would recommend this product for those who are people new to cooking Korean food. The hot pepper paste came in perfect condition.
1;My wife uses this coffee in our espresso machine to make cappuchinos with cocoa powder and it is great.  She says it has a nice strong coffee flavor but smooth not bitter.  I don't drink coffee but I took some to work for the drip machine there and several of the coffee drinkers love it.
1;I put all my dogs on this food about a month and a half ago. I began to notice my older/overweight dog become more playful and energetic. He has already lost some weight. Also all of the others have more solid stools and they actually enjoy eating this. I would recommend this to everyone.
1;"""I purchased a Keurig so my husband could make just one cup of coffee for breakfast instead of making a French press full and pitching half of it.  I use it to make unsweetened iced tea.  With the plethora of sweetened iced tea k-cups"
1;I love my keurig and especially like to fix my iced tea with these kcups. They are very flavorful  and every glass is fresh brewed!  I drink iced tea all year so I a glad I found an affordable optuIon!
1;"""I ordered this assorted bartons turkish delight 6in1 it is delicious .I took it to my parents house for my sister's birthday among her gifts which I also bought at amazon everyone at the party loved this Turkish delight so much they even wanted to buy it for them and I told them amazon go there they have everything"
1;My four year old chinese crested mix loves these dog treats. He is somewhat of a picky eater when it comes to dog treats but he loves these. They smell nice and minty and take a little while for him to eat so it gives him something to work at. They are made with good ingredients. No meat byproducts or corn! AND they are made in the USA which is definite plus. I will continue to get these for my pup.
1;"""I'm a runner doing 30-50 miles a week and am currently (9/10) training for the Chicago Marathon.  I've tried all of the gels and chews that are out there and these are my favorite.  I don't like gels as that squirt of mush activates my gag reflex.  Plus you always need water with them.  I've tried all of the other brands of energy chews (I think)"
1;When I'm riding and hit the wall where my legs are just out of gas (glycogen) I can eat a pack of these chews and within minutes feel relief and renewed energy!  I never go on a ride without them.  oh yeah...they taste pretty good too.
1;These energy chews are absolutely delicious! They hold up really well in your pocket or backpack when you're backpacking or mountain biking! I really couldn't imagine eating any other energy chew ever again!
1;These taste good - kind of like cherry koolaid. 95% organic ingredients make it a bit healthier than koolaid. Better than the Clif Bloks (I say that b/c the cola Clif Bloks have a medicinal after taste).
1;We do a lot of bicycle riding in the heat and longer rides as well. We don't want to crash from lack of carbs in our system. Other energy products don't taste as good as these do. They are conveniently packed in little pouches so they are easy to grab and take along when we ride. Good stuff!
1;I tasted a few of these and they are pretty good.  I was expecting something a bit flavorless and I can imagine happily snacking on these for a multi-day packing hike.  I will write more after I have taken them on the trail.
1;"""I'm training for my first marathon in November 2011 and these chews have kept me going during my long 18 to 20 mile training runs.  I dissolve them in water rather than carry them as chews and sip steadily after mile 8.  They taste like concentrated hawaiian punch and do not upset my stomach whatsoever.  I also eat them prior to a workout if I am feeling low energy and will even snack on them in lieu of candy.  Seriously"
1;"""I was excited to try these little honey chews to help with my energy levels during exercising and running.  I am 60 years old and about 50 pounds overweight.  I find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising.  First of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary.  I was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup.  I guess with the package calling it honey stinger I was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers.  Still"
1;"""The box is very impressive. So I had high expectations (especially when it comes to chocolate).<br />The combination of chopped up nuts and small pieces of dark chocolate is brilliant - unlike anything I have tasted before. Amazing flavor - somewhere between velvet (chocolate) and crispy (nuts).  Made me feel almost relaxed... weired...<br />Yesterday"
1;This is a very refreshing carbonated juice drink with no aftertaste.  I love the flavor and the fact that there is no added sugar.  It's more subtle than orange so really kills a thirst.  The size is perfect for times when you don't really want a 12 ounce drink.
1;This stuff taste just like flavored carbonated water.<br />In this case Flavored with orange and tangerine.<br />I imagine it's better for you than plain soda.<br />I really found it tasty. It has a strong citrus flavor<br />that I preferred to some of the other flavors.
1;Our family is a huge fan of IZZE and this was right in line with that. The flavor was not too sweet and refreshing. My favorite way to enjoy this was with some ice and vodka...obviously that's only for those of you reading this that are 21 yrs or older!
1;"""I also got the Cherry one and this is just as good.  It's a break from soda or water or coffee.  I really liked the light refreshing taste and it doesn't fill you up like sodas can.  It's very very tasty and it had a very fresh orange taste"
1;"""The Switch Orange Tangerine is one of the most refreshing drinks that I have ever tried. It is 100% pure orange and tangerine juice and the difference from the regular sodas is quite obvious. Right from the first sip it feels richer and tastier than any soda product out there. After drinking it"
1;"""I say all these reviewers who say this stuff is too sweet are WRONG! Have it on the rocks! The melting ice will water it down just right. I tried four flavors and here is my ranking:<br /><br />1st Place: <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40 >Kiwi Berry</a><br />2nd Place: <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54 >Watermelon Strawberry</a><br />3rd Place: <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E >Black Cherry</a><br />4th Place: <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O >Orange Tangerine</a>"""
1;"""To be blunt I'd call this Orangina (<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000121BY6 >Sparkling Citrus Beverage with Pulp - 4 Glass Bottles</a>) sans pulp.  Basically the drink has minimal carbonation"
1;"""I like orange soda but usually cannot drink an entire can or bottle of Sunkist or <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168A9KG >Orange Crush Case 4-6pk</a> because they are so sickly sweet. This has just the right touch of natural sweetness"
1;"""This can of juice was delicious.  It reminded me of the Orangina beverage.  I did find it strange that they chose to package this product in a can normally associated with  Energy Drinks  like Red Bull since they market it as  All Natural .  Nevertheless"
1;Very Natural flavor. Not loaded with sugars and other things not good for you. Has a fresh taste of orange/tangerine and the carbonation is great. Great taste. I enjoyed this product and would recommend.
1;I love the taste of this soda. It's sweet with no bitter aftertaste that can be found in some orange sodas. I'd never guess this was a natural drink from the taste alone.<br /><br />My only complaint would be the serving size. It's correct for a serving size but not what I'm used to in a soda can. (12 oz.)
1;"""I also reviewed the Jones Soda Berry Pomegranate vitamin water and that one fell short because it was mostly water and sugar and cost over $1 per bottle.<br /><br />The Switch Orange Tangerine is much better in my opinion in terms of flavor. It's also carbonated up quite a bit and has added ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) which gives it a lot of tang/bite. For me it isn't unpleasant at all - I like it.<br /><br />Contrary to other reviews"
1;I tried the Black Cherry version and liked it but this one is much better.  Great orange taste plus the benefit of juice.  And no corn syrup sweetner for those worried about its use.  The carbonation helps make it a satisfying drink to quench thirst and the knowledge that it is healthy satisfies the mind as well.
1;I was really surprised at the taste of the Switch Orange Tangerine drink. It reminds me of carbonated orange juice. It is a little on the sweet side but not too bad in my opinion. This is actually a beverage that I could drink all the time and not get tired of.<br /><br />The BEST thing about Switch is that it is HEALTHY for you and it doesn't have any added sugars and it has a lot of Vitamin C. Switch is a all natural beverage which is great. You can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda.<br /><br />If you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then I highly recommend Switch. If you like orange juice then I think you'll really enjoy this. The cans are a little on the smaller side though.
1;"""I really enjoyed this soda. I used to be a big fan of Orangina a few years ago but Switch Orange Tangerine is WAY better -especially if your looking for a true orangey taste. A cold one of these would be very refreshing on a hot summer day. Tastes sort of like real orange juice mixed with seltzer"
1;This was a great buy for the money and a hard product to find.  I was pleased when I received it doing it this way I cut my coffee costs down by 2/3rd even after you consider the price of the product I am very happy
1;These were on backorder for a long time but well worth the wait. I can finally use the coffee beans I've had for awhile and have a great cup of coffee with no grounds. I totally love the product and will definately order more in the future. Would like to see them in 100 count.
1;"""I was very pleased with these disposable k-cups.  I read other peoples comments that the lids are hard to get on.  I found that true at first until I just used one finger and pressed them on in the center.  I heard a click and they were ready to go.  I will order a larger amount next time to save on shipping.  The hot chocolate K-cups prefilled are terrible"
1;This is the second time I've ordered this product and I plan to order these often.  They work perfectly and I am able to use my favorite speciality coffees especially when I run out of the prefilled K-cups sold at retail stores.
1;"""These cups are so easy to use and saves so much money compared to the store bought Kups.  You can use whatever coffee you want and have as many flavors as you want.  We are on our 9th box of these and will continue to use them.<br /><br />The seller is great in regards to contact and shipping.  The last shipment arrived just a couple of days after we bought them. Long before the  due date  listed when the order was placed."""
1;"""These cups work great! We have had a Keurig for about a year and use a refillable filter cup. Its so tedious to refill every time you want a cup of coffee. Especially at 4am before work! These cups are so easy to use and perfect for mornings when you just want a quick cup of coffee. The lids are a little tough to get on sometimes and they get stuck in the top of the machines occasionally"
1;I received and have been using my DisposaKups for several days.  I highly recomend this product.  I fill up a dozen or so at a time and just pop them into the Coffee maker when I want a fresh cup of coffee.  The coffee comes out fresh and with no coffee grounds in the cup.  Who could ask for more?
1;This product works exactly as  it is advertised.  No more rinsing wire baskets.  The coffe is as good as the already filled k cups that you buy in the store.  It's nice to just throw the whole thing in the trash when done and not clog the sink.  Couldn't be happier as it gives me unlimited choices for coffee and  it saves money too!  Amazon is great!
1;I love these disposable K-Cups as I prefer to use my own brand(s).  These accomplish the job perfectly and so easy to use.  Thankyou for this product.  Seller was prompt in shipping.  Good packaging.  I will purchase again.  A++++
1;I ordered the DisposaKups because I have several coffees in bags that I had left over and wanted to use.  The cups work great.  I quickly figured out that the filter must be pushed down in order for the lid to fit. Easy to load and easy to dispose.
1;I have tried another brand of one cup coffee making.  These made the job easy and no mess.  The other method had a plastic holder and lid and a paper basket.  You disposed of the inserted paper basket only.  The plastic would be very warm to the touch at the very least.  Then you had to rinse the plastic holder and top for any grinds that might have escaped.
1;This product saves me money since I can use a regular brand that i like in these kcups and I can still have the kcup convenience of making one drink at a time without using nasty instant coffee.  Great product!
1;"""I am so grateful that DisposKups exist--and are now in use in my home!<br /><br />No other type of device for brewing bagged coffee in my Keurig (k-cup)or any other way to recycle K-cups has worked well for me. The standard device made by Keurig is so difficult to clean each time"
1;I was getting tired from washing out the little refillable baskets to make a second cup. The solutions are to get multiple baskets or the disposable type. The filtering is a little better and the coffee has fewer solids. It is easy to use and does what it says.
1;My wife just loves these cups.  First off I have to say they arrived a month earlier than stated.  Excellent!  The convenience of being able to use your own coffee and throw away the little cups afterwards is fantastic.  No clean-up.  Excellent.
1;Product arrived earlier than expected and was just what I expected - an easy and cheap way to make my own Keurig K-cups. Great for company. Everyone gets what they want without having to buy a whole box of K-cups. I just buy a few of the little one pot coffee packages and can make whatever someone wants. Awesome!
1;"""There is known design flaw having to do with the gasket on the upper needle. You can hear the screams about that by reading the reviews for the 'My Cup'. The gasket moves too much and as a result is does not seal correctly. Green Mountain seems to not want to fix it since it means selling less over-priced coffee"
1;After a lot of trial and error (with just water!) I figured out how to make these handy self-fill coffee pods NOT leak all over the place. The secret is to shove the filter all the way into the pod and NOT snap the lid over the edge of the filter. Make sure the filter is ALL INSIDE. It's rigid enough and stays upright and fine when you brew. You really need to create a seal with the lid. Leaving the filter hanging out breaks the seal and allows liquid to seep out.
1;My daughter lives in Hawaii and sent me some great coffee from there. I have a Keurig and  was not sure how to use the new coffee. I got these fast fast and now am using my Hawaiian coffee. Great product.
1;"""This comment refers to ALL OF THE DO IT YOURSELF K-CUPS.<br />My K-Cup by Keurig<br />Ekobrew<br />EZ Cup.<br /><br />They products above ALL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.<br />You have to get the correct grind on the whole coffee bean.<br />And it's NOT what you think if you are familiar with grinding espresso.<br /><br />If water is coming out the top"
1;"""I have never enjoyed my Keureg more!  They couldn't be easier to use and I'm so happy to be using my favorite coffee and making it to my own specifications.  Love these things!!<br /><br />Additional comment:  In reading the reviews I see some complaints about leakage"
1;"""I have given this product five stars because it works very well for coffee with the filters that come with it.<br /><br />But my five stars come with a warning: don't use these little cups without using the little filters"
1;"""My husband recently bought me a Keurig Brewer.  I was excited for my new toy but my joy quickly turned into dismay when I saw how expensive the little  cups  cost.  I love coffee and have always bought beans to grind.  I was DELIGHTED when I found these wonderful little disposable filters to use with my Brewer.  Now I have the best of both worlds!<br />I placed my order and to my surprise they showed up 3 days later!"""
1;I was happy to get the disposacups and look forward to using them.  I really like the paper filters. I am wondering if the cups can be used again. I know the lid can't. I will see what happens with this for future uses.
1;i had a kerig before and it broke. the company said it was because i was using expresso in the k-cup and it was to fine and cloged the machine. kerig does not make a k-cup with spanish coffee so when i found these i was very happy. i have been using these for about a month and i love them and it is so much cheaper. i would highly recommend these.

1;These are definitely the best chocolate raisins out there. They are the perfect balance of chocolate and raisin...and my boyfriend won't have any others. Too many brands have a TON of chocolate around an itty bitty raisin. What's the point? These are great and a treat!
1;"""This dog food is a keeper. I have to buy special dog food for my dog because he has allergies to chicken and brown rice.<br />My Vet prescribed an Iams brand food with kangaroo meat in it. My dog didn't really care for the taste but he ate it.<br />I wanted something more natural"
1;I've given these to friends that don't eat spicy and they wanted to kill me afterwards.  Actually one person did not want to speak to me at work for a week.  These are pretty spicy.  I'll normally sit down and eat maybe 20-30 at a time and that's it.  If you're a fan of Dave's hot sauces then you owe it to yourself to get this 4 pack.  It's also a great gift or stocking stuffer.
1;"""A friend gave me a tea bag to try while at work yesterday.  I accidentally oversteeped the tea and expected a very strong bitter brew.  I was very happy with the smoothness of this tea.  While it was quite strong"
1;I spent along time and a lot of money looking for a great Earl Grey... to this point its been loose leaf tea i order from another site until my girl friend went to London with her family bring me back a small sample pack of 10 tea bags. i loved it so much i had gotten this 6 pack of 20 count boxes which i have polished off and reordered since then.<br /><br />The tea stays fresh in the foil package each tea bag  which makes it so air and light cant damage the flavor of the tea which is the problem is loose leaf tea's.<br /><br />The flavor of the tea is a nice Bergamot flavor which is smooth no matter how long you leave the tea in. i perfer mine strong and straight up. each sit is as good as the first. i will keep buying this tea and also try other ones by ahmad of London
1;I love Ahmad tea. The Earl Grey is a wonderful tea for an afternoon sipping. The bergamot flavour isn't overpowering like some other brands I have tried.<br /><br />I will be buying more of this wonderful tea
1;I thought these had avery good flavor.  I took two tubs to work and most of the people liked them.  Two or three people commented that they liked them better than some other brands because they are not salty.
1;"""The grapefruit and blackberry flavors are the current favorite at my house on Tuesday nights when we try to always have a rotisserie chicken and homemade gravy while watching TV.<br /><br />Once you taste the subtle fruit flavors mingling perfectly in a not overly carbonated sparkling water"
1;OK this poor guy begged my daughter to make him my pecan pie and well she is a microwave girl! So for christmass what better way to a man than his stomach.  he now has pies he can pack in his lunch box.  They are sssooooo good.
1;"""Just ate my first batch and it's as good as any white popcorn I have had. I encountered difficulty obtaining white popcorn from grocery stores and was reduced to eating the horrible yellow type. Luckily I decided to shop this site"
1;I tried thhis popcorn in a the Presto Poplite Air Popcorn machine.  the instructions were easy and the results were very gratifying.  I added sea salt and a little Olive oil.  The measuring container made 5 quarts.  I just  couldn't stop eating it.  Simply delicious.
1;"""For my daughter's birthday I ordered her a Stir Crazy popcorn maker.  I was busy and knew I didn't have time to run to the grocery store.  I ordered the popcorn on line too.  We made the popcorn using organic coconut oil.  We were shocked to see almost every kernel popped.  1/2 cup and the popper was full.  The popcorn was big and fluffy.  The flavor was good.  The first time we put butter and salt on it.  The second time just salt and it was great!  We placed it in baggies and took it to the movies.  Okay - so maybe that sounds a bit cheap however our popcorn was fresh"
1;My sister turned me on to White Popcorn over yellow popcorn.<br /><br />She said it was more tender however did not pop as large.<br /><br />Guess she had some store bought stuff.<br /><br />I put the same amount in as Walley World yellow popcorn and it blew the lid off the pot!<br /><br />I'm a convert to this brand of white popcorn!
1;"""I ordered several kinds of highly-rated popcorn from Amazon at one time.  I admit I was skeptical of some of the rave reviews.  Well the Snappy white popcorn arrived first so I tried it immediately.  I actually measured (I usually just eye-ball it) 3 T canola oil"
1;"""This is the wondeful white popcorn we ate in Iowa years ago! I am so glad to find it. And what a great price too!<br />I got it today and popped some right away. I used the microwave popcorn bowl I bought from Amazon"
1;This is great popcorn!!!  I just purchased a second batch.  I never had a problem w/a ton of kernels left in my air popper or many hulls.  As long as this is being produced and sold I will be a buyer!<br /><br />The only con I have is that the only seal on the canister is a small piece of tape on the lid/canister.  I was surprised to not see some type of freshness seal like you would see on a ketchup bottle.  Surprisingly though I had no issues with humidity effecting the corn (maybe because I'm in a dryer climate?).
1;"""I ordered this popping corn after being disappointed with the local big box store selection-two brands.  One of them tasted chalky like styrofoam and its claim was larger popped kernels.  No taste.<br /><br />I mainly use this popcorn with one of those plastic microwave popping bowls.  I noticed that 1/3 cup yields more cooked popcorn than two other brands I have tried.  It kept on popping after my usual 2 minute and 20 second routine.  When using microwave poppers"
1;This is the best white popcorn yet! I've tried the others sold on Amazon & there's no comparison. It was fluffy & flavorful & almost every kernel popped!(how often can you say that?) I've already ordered more so I won't run out.
1;This is a very good gingerbread mix. Lots of flavor and easy to make. It's probably a bit overpriced but I was having alot of difficulty finding any gingerbread mix in the grocery store. I use this mix to make gingerbread muffins with diced pears and dried cranberries. I'll purchase another six boxes when I run out of mix. A good buy and good product.
1;"""LOVE them!! I love knowing how much better this is for me than potato chips or typical crackers. I am focused on eating nutrient dense food and am avoiding putting into my mouth non-food items for entertainment only. I love crunchy foods and this is great. The flavors are all good except don't like the sweet maple and cinn. flavor as much.<br />My family doesnt like them because they are not evolved yet"
1;These crackers are incredible. Healthy and tasty - you can't go wrong. The Italian and Mexican Harvest are my favorites. The cinnamon are great for breakfast with yogurt. Buying the six pack allowed me to taste all to see which ones I would order again.
1;I love this tea and have no complaints!!!  I just want to comment on how the tea is packaged.  It comes loose in little plastic baggies so if you want to use it you have to have some sort of filter.  We have an iced tea maker and used a cone coffee filter which works just fine.  I did buy a 2 inch tea ball but the loose tea just falls right through it so I guess I didn't buy the right thing.
1;Some people mentioned the loose tea is difficult to filter.<br /><br />USE A FRENCH PRESS made for coffee is a good option - dilute concentrate to desire strength. My favorite flavors are: Mango and Passion Fruit.
1;I purchased this product mainly to try out the different flavors of tea. When I find the flavor I like I will probably buy a case of it. China mist tea taste great. As for those who have problems with tea leaves getting in the tea don't worry. I went to the local supermarket (HEB in Texas) and found empty tea bags in a box for about $5.They work great. Fill with tea and fold top and staple.
1;"""So i had this cheese on my mind ever since trying it at a restaurant in SF.  This was one of those things that i though when Im bored and want to burn money on shipping i would order.  Is it worth it?  Yes if you are a cheese fan"
1;I tried this at first as a gluten-free alternative to cream of mushroom soup.  Turns out its really good!  Modified my MILs swedish meatballs recipe using this sauce as the base.  Also served it with shitakes over rice.  Very versatile and tasty! And its great that the ingredients don't read like an industrial compound.
1;"""If there is one good thing about a cold Winter's day it is hot soup. The Women's Bean Project provided me with one of the best and it is good for me too. How often can we do something that is good for us and so enjoyable at the same time?<br />I have told all of my friends about it and I hope they will"
1;"""My Westie - like the picture on the package - loves these treats!  They are the perfect size for a treat or reward and even look cute...we call them<br /> puppy paws  treats!  Good texture - no mess!  Smell not attractive to humans - but good to a dog!"""
1;This is The best dog food their is because everything is very. Digestible and when the dog does digest it all digested because they use all the nutrition from it. So it is healther and the best out their far as I'm think
1;because these are more expensive than some of the other brands. I decided to order since they had great reviews and are a product of the USA. I'm sure glad I did because these are delicious! My whole family likes them straight out of the package. We've not yet taken the time to roast them.
1;"""I had never tried Bob's Red Mill pumpkin seeds although I have used and been very happy with many of their other products. I was looking for pumpkin seeds from pumpkins grown in the USA. Most of the organic seeds are from China. The Bob's Red Mill seeds are from pumpkins grown in Oregon.<br /><br />I took the plunge and ordered 4 bags of these seeds"
1;They are raw so I put them on a cookie shhet no spray and dry roast them at 350 for 7 to 9 min. Then they have a roasted flavor without any of the oils.Cankeep in freezer to keep fresh.VEry yummy. Great on salads.
1;"""The only difference I can see between using this blend and using brown sugar is that you don't get the usual  sugar rush  when you eat the result.  Cookies and pies made with this Splenda blend - which does contain some sugar - taste the exactly the same as they did before.  Great stuff!  And it's gluten-free too."""
1;Baking for my husband (with type 2 diabetes) just go easier.<br />I can adapt regular receipes. I use only half the amount of sugar called for a Bam! they turn out great. The 4 pack is a great buy too!
1;if every seller was like JR mushrooms the world would be a much better place. They wont stop until there customer is completly satisfied. I ordered some winter black truffles from them and got my package lightning fast but came to find out that it wasnt what i ordered. I called JR and they said they sent better quality black truffles that cost more for the same price and this story doesnt end they even sent a jar of the original truffles i ordered just so i can taste the diffrence FOR FREE!!!!!!!!! Name another seller that would do that.
1;Finally - a company that cares about it's reputation and products!  I ordered these truffles and recieved them securely packaged and protected to ensure they arrived safely and as quickly as possible.  I am even planning a special dinner with friends entirely based around the truffles I ordered as I was so please with them.<br /><br />  I also saw the other products this company carries - the attention to detail and the information provided on each and every product is outstanding - just like their quality (i.e.: Saffron).  I have found my gourmet source from now on!
1;"""True story: I surfed online looking for difficult and expensive to find gourmet ingredients when I came across this listing.  Every review raved about the excellent service provided by JR Mushrooms.  I phoned them to ask a question about refrigeration vs shelf storage and got a voice-mail.  I left a message and five minutes later the man himself personally called and gave me friendly and professional answers to my questions.  I ordered these truffles and several other items.  The next morning there was a little personal e-mail from JR thanking me for the order and by noon the order had arrived"
1;"""I gave this item as a gift and the recipient has not yet made the dish for which I gave it to her (a Foie Gras dish). But I must say this price for a French truffle is amazing. I suspect most of us do not have the palates to appreciate the $300 truffles. Good for those of you who do. But for the rest of us"
1;This is our second time using your black winter truffles....they are truly delicious. We throw them in with pasta and truffle oil to have the world's best dish...reminds of our stay in Tuscany. This is a quality product and we plan on buying again in the near future.
1;love the snack.  wanted to buy a bunch.<p>shipping at amazon is more than the price of the snack.  try ordering a dozen and then look at the shipping price.<p>every link i've tried to this snack takes you back to amazon's exhorbitant shipping rates.<p>another reason to buy your books at overstock.com.  too back they don't carry food as well.
1;"""Wow this Chocolate Raspberry flavored coffee is the absolute best we have ever had and I can honestly say we have tried quite a few in our time. And of course the price can't be beat unless you find someone who wants to sell you some that  fell  off the back of some delivery truck."""
1;I am so happy to have found a wonderful decaf tea for myself and guests. This tea is nice and full flavored and has a very smooth finish. I usually use the K-cup twice on xl setting and the tea remains true and delicious. The price is the best i have found anywhere
1;I have been drinking Twining's tea for years.  It used to be made in England but now they have a plant in North Carolina for the American trade.  The tea is excellent. I drink the decaf for health reasons and find that it is as tasty as the regular tea.
1;"""I brewed this kit first as it was the one that came with the brewery kit. I followed the instructions exactly. NOTE: If you don't follow the instructions exactly you are opening up opportunity for problems. I brewed for about 7 days. I then bottled and let condition for 2 weeks at room temperature. I then put the beer in the fridge. I tried two bottles the next day. The taste was OK"
1;I have been brewing this beer off and on for the past five years along with many others. When it comes time to pour a glass it has never let me down. Even without using lagering methods it always develops into a a tasty drink.
1;I just discovered this addiction at TJMaxx!!!  I paid $7.99 (kind of pricy) but when I opened the bag and tasted them for the first time....OMG!  I could'nt believe it!  I can not put the bag down!  You can't eat just one...I have to stop myself from eating so many.  I have googled the website and they are down for construction until October 1st.  My only hope is when they open up the site that they will sell these at a reasonable price and not be outrageously priced like ebay and others!  I like them but I'm not paying over $7.99 for them!  Anywho....Give these little snacks a try!  They taste great and most of all Healthy!
1;"""Ssssssssssssssh don't tell anybody!!!  More for me!  These are the best snacks ever and I am excited about them because my daughter plays softball and we have snack rotation... guess what they will be getting? Also for the kids little league"
1;"""Grandpa Po's Originals scored big on our party's fun factor. These half-baked nuggets of organic popcorn blended with dry-roasted soybeans were a surprise hit with both kids and adults. Our young nibblers approached this snack with a quizzical"
1;" ""The Crunchy Popcorn Snack with Soybeans  that Grandpa Po has created makes us want to meet the ol' man and give him a pat on the back! While we are questioning the slogan on the package  Better Than Food  - there is"
1;"""Outstanding!  DElicious!  What on earth are these things? Simple. They're a yummy mix of nuggets made from organic popcorn and organic dry roasted soybeans. They're so delicious your head may actually explode once you taste them. Slightly Unsalted"
1;We have always loved this snack.  Each time we seem to enjoy it a little bit more.  My daughter is a huge fan of it and is so glad that we can grab it and go.  It's a nutritious snack that satisfies all the tastebuds.  Some of us have even tried the slightly spicy brand.  Having both flavors allows us to satisfy those who like spicy and those who don't with the same snack...thus no arguments between the kids!
1;"""I pass around favorable endorsements very seldom but this is one of those occasions.<br /><br />I'm almost 69 and this bacon would be as almost identical to the bacon I ate if it were a bit saltier and had the rind left on.<br /><br />If you want the old time southern bacon without all the salt and the rind"
1;I actually bought this to use as a squirrel repellant (which it worked fantastically) safe to treat your gardens with. HOWEVER i found myself using this to cook more than anything else. Tastes great when sprinkled over wings
1;THIS SELLER WAS GREAT!!!RECIEVED MY ORDER IN ABOUT 4 DAYS!!! THE CAYENNE IS GREAT!!!NICE FLAVOR AND HOT JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT!!! wILL BE BACK FOR MORE AFTER THE 2LBS ARE GONE!!! THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT AT A GOOD PRICE!!!
1;"""My husband and I enjoy a really good cup of tea. Lana's Snowflake Black Tea sounded so interesting and the five star reviews made it simply irresistible - I had to try it. The delivery was very fast and it was nicely packaged. When my husband saw we had new tea he had to open it. The next thing I heard"
1;"""The best soda crackers so tempting I've reordered.<br /><br />I will probably not order a third time though because of the high shipping cost... nothing to do with my satisfaction with the product.<br />I hope the company will consider using Amazon Prime.<br />I savor each crunch"
1;Found these locally in Chicago about 6 months ago.  Amazon's price is high but these are definitely the best I have ever tried.  My wife and I cook with it and just spread it on toast or crackers.  The white jar is also distinctive.
1;"""oUR 3 YEAR OLD SON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BEING ALLERGIC TO SOY AND PEANUTS. THIS IS THE ONLY SUNFLOWER BUTTER THAT WE HAVE FOUND THAT IS FREE OF BOTH ALLERGENS AND NOT PROCESSED ON SHARED EQUIPMENT.  THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT WE BUY NOW.  OUR SON LIKES IT ON PB&J"
1;when i ordered these 2 bags it was only $18_ today it's $37.....so i paid $9 for a little more than 2 pounds bag with  free s/h via amazon prime membership.<br /><br />it had more plain m&m's than any other candy- but that could have just been my bags- you may find differently- all the bags were sealed and none of the candy was broken or crushed- it is fresh and the expire or 'best if used' by date is JULY 2013- so long shelf life.  i also sent a couple of bags to my senior parents who love chocolate.<br /><br />if you found this helpful- please click on the 'yes' box-- thanx
1;Wow!  Great price! I'll never buy these at the pet store again!  About 6 months ago we started giving our rat terriers Greenies after my vet told me about them.  We couldn't afford $400 +  each to have our dog's teeth cleaned (and there is just no way these dogs would let me brush their teeth) so we tried these.  What a difference it made!!!!  The tartar an plaque buildup on my 11 yr old girl is almost completely gone and my 6 yr old boy's teeth look like I had them professionally cleaned.  The added bonus is Greenies make their breath smell great and my dogs love the taste of them!
1;I am a big fan of anything Annie's so it is no surprise I give these 5 stars. There is simply no comparison between 'the chessiest' and the truly chessiest mac & cheese - which is Annie's. I enjoy the white cheddar the most.
1;To all those who complain of the taste......you arent making it right.<br /><br />I know because sometimes i put in a little too much milk....or whatever. But when you make this stuff right it really rules. Its also good to know that im not eating as many chemicals as other kinds of mac and cheese.<br /><br />I find the family size serving better personally.
1;"""This has to be the best and easiest bread machine mix I've come across.  Incredibly simple directions and impossible to fail.  Plus the loafs come out perfect everytime (I've had issues in the past with getting whole wheat flours to rise as well as white flours).  I've purchased this  collection  several times and will continue to do so."""
1;"""I first purchased this food at the Pomona Pet Expo this year and as I do all my cooking for my animals I was looking for a natural grain free dry to add to their wet.  I learned that feeding your dogs the right food from an early age is key to keeping them healthy and with you for as long as possible.<br /><br />This by far is one of the best Natural foods I have purchased and my dogs just (Love) it..  The Holistic Primitive is high in Protein and very well tolerated by sensitive stomachs.  This food has never been recalled and is made in it's own plant"
1;I ordered this and several other plants from this seller.<br /><br />I was quite suprised to find that the plant was much larger than I expected (with a full six heads on it!) and well packed. Every plant I got in this shipment is thriving and happy. It has been two weeks now and nothing has failed to thrive. This is more than I can say about others that I have bought from!<br /><br />I will be buying from this company again.
1;I bought this as a gift for my sister and her family who live in Arizona. They were so excited when it came and it was small enough to not be a bother but big enough to be interesting and pretty. They were pleased. It came almost right away (days!) and the package was in good shape.
1;"""My plant arrived quickly and packaged very well. Almost too well cause I was so anxious to see it and it took a bit of time to unwrap it:) The first day it didn't want to eat because of the stress from shipping"
1;"""We love to feed ours.  I chase flies and insects around the house sometimes just to watch them eat.  I would recommend buying some type of planitarium for them.  They need a warm humid space.  Only use distilled water.  NOT FILTERED!  These plants are very delicate when it comes to the water you give them.  I would even go so far as to buy a guide book.  Don't buy the  happy plants .  It's a good book for a kid. But it's not a guide on how to raise these plants. These plants are a great conversation piece for house guests.  Need I say more? ENJOY! Chazz"""
1;The plant arrived in great condition ... fully green and with about five or six heads in the clear box that can serve as a terrarium.  Will give it our best shot on keeping it up and running!  This was in much better shape than the venus flytrap plants at our local big-box do-it-yourself in their garden area.
1;I love white polenta but most of what I find in the U.S. is very coarse.  It still tastes great but the texture leaves a lot to be desired.  Moretti Polenta Friulana Bianco is amazing - the creamiest and finest I have ever seen.
1;I was looking all over for milk in a paint can and I found it! Thank you Amazon. The only down side is that it is the sweet milk from a goat's teat. Once one gets over that it is by far the best powdered milk in a paint can that I ever ordered online.
1;"""I prefer this powdered milk to the condensed form that Meyerberg sells. The condensed has a more sour flavor to it.  One has to realize that goat's milk is not cow's milk in that it is richer or creamier in flavor so it does startle one until your palate get's used to something which tastes  different . When it is warm"
1;"""Our little baby girl battled colic and reflux for nearly 6 weeks. She was unable to sleep because her little belly hurt - she would be 90% asleep when she would arch her back ad then scream in pain. Baby"
1;We have been using Meyenberg's powdered goat milk for several years.  We used to buy their milk in cartons at Walmart and it was good.  The only problem was that we live so far from a Walmart store that we would run out of goat's milk between trips.  We decided to try the powdered and found that it mixes and stays mixed very well and tastes exactly like the liquid milk in the cartons.  Of course it stores easily and indefinitely and we highly recommend it to anyone who wants or has to drink goats milk.
1;"""My three-year-old daughter has been drinking this brand of goat milk for the last 2 years because she is dairy intolerant.  This is a great product. Easy to carry (because it's a powder) and mix it when you need it.  And"
1;"""This goat's milk has been a godsend for our granddaughter who seemed to get sick on every formula we tried.  The goat milk with a little coconut oil and extra DHA became a fantastic infant formula.  Once she started using the goat milk"
1;"""I tried the condensed version and thought it was horrible so was concerned that I would not like the powdered either.  Before I tried the powdered I had some of the fresh from my grocery store and really liked it.  As it turns out"
1;My baby has had digestive issues from birth. At 12 months I put her on this product and immediately saw improvement.  It didn't take long for her to accept it either.  I found a recipe on the Dr. Sears website for making goats milk formula for infants and would have tried it when she was younger. TIP: This powder doesn't dissolve in water as easily as regular formula. Make a days worth of milk ahead of time and use a wire wisk to mix it.
1;my daughter is allergic to all dairy and cannot have all the extra iron they pump into the poisness formulas that they say are sooo healthy for your babies growth. this goats milk gives her all the nutrients that she needs. i would suggest to any mother even if the baby is not allergic to dairy.
1;"""We started with fresh goats milk and after 2 weeks transitioned to this product.  I prepare it with warm water in the blender and add some strawberry flavoring.  My son (17 months) loves it.  Very easy to prepare"
1;The flavor is very good. 45 seconds in the microwave and one measure of this milk and you are done (stir). I can noticed the difference between the whole milk from cow and this goat milk...it is much much better to digest.
1;This product is very easy to use and is good for people (and pets) that are lactose intolerant.  I use it as a treat for my ferrets and they love it!  It can help sick ferrets feel better and gain weight.  Thank you for offering something so easy to use!
1;This product is the best choice for adding calcium+vitD and protein in your diet. Cow's milk gives me stomach trouble whereas this doesn't. I drink it regularly myself. I also add the powder in my home-made baby food for my son starting around 6 months. Powdered form has an additional benefit. You can reconstitute it into whatever concentration you'd like. Yum!
1;"""We've been using Meyenberg Powdered Goat Milk for our little girl since she was 6 months of age.  My wife and I love this product.  We opted not to feed our child any formula milk out there.  My wife breastfeeds and due to low breast milk production"
1;"""I have been drinking this powdered goat milk for years! It is the best no after taste with all the immune boosting benefits! I have an 8mos. Old and plan to feed him this starting on his first birthday"
1;Works well instead of formula or soy milk for my daughters bottle. Easy to mix as long as water is warmed. And she loves the taste! Plus much more affordable than buying goat milk cartons in the store.
1;We wanted to use milk that was lactose free and close to breast milk.  We began using this milk to supplement my breast milk and we now use it full time.  My baby has never had an allergic reaction to it and he doesn't spit up.  It's gentle on his stomach and Amazon has it at an inexpensive price.  I would suggest this milk to any parent that prefers something different than cow's milk.
1;we used to get this from our local grocery store for our 10month baby girl but it was $2 more a can and with prime there is no shipping charges as well as no taxes YAY!our baby loves this and it really has cut down on her spitting up.
1;Excellent stuff! My baby is allergic to dairy and soy.<br />This is the only formula she could tolerate. It<br />smells but she loves it! When they are under a year<br />old you add brown rice syrup to give more calories.<br />Then you gradually wean them off of the brown<br />syrup so by the time they are a year they are drinking<br />straight goats milk.
1;"""My 5mo daughter has a severely sensitive stomach associated to an iron intolerance. She's been formula fed since the beginning due to my personal choice. I went through 8 different commerical milk-based and soy-based formulas. A good friend of ours suggested goat's milk. Her nephew was a failure to thrive baby and the ONLY formula he didn't throw up was Goat's Milk. I can easily find the liquid Goat's Milk at our local grocery store. Unfortunately"
1;Wonderful product! I began to use it for my daughter who was about to turn a year old. She took it with no problems! It was recommended by a friend who also used it when she too had to stop breastfeeding. Much better for a child in my eyes. I had tried a formula sample I had received in the mail- it left a greasy film in the bottle... gross. This does not! My daughter will drink it warm or cold- so easy for on the go as well. The canned was a bit harsh and she wasn't into it.. it tastes like a goat smells- this just has a suttle hint of goat. LoL
1;This stuff is fantastic.  My little girl loves it and it gives me the piece of mind knowing that I am not feeding her a huge amount of sugar with mainstream formulas.  Not to mention the other things they have found in them recently.  This is the closest thing to mothers milk.  If your baby spits up a lot you should definitely try this stuff.  My little girl hasn't spit up since I switched ever.  Love it.  Just wish I could buy even more at a time.
1;"""I started my son on this powdered milk and he transitioned easily from breast milk without any problems.  I use a gallon container and mix the whole can (3 quarts) at once with luke warm water and it works out perfectly. I really like this company and their product and love that this milk is also Vit D fortified.  Once my son gets older and he consumes less milk we will transition to the fresh goat milk"
1;My daughter is sensitive to cow's milk so we tried Goat milk and it works well. Amazon is the cheapest place to purchase this stuff! The powder sometimes has a hard time mixing with the water.  But not too bad.  Recommend to anyone needing a healthy alternative to cow's milk.
1;This is the best alternative to cows milk for the first 2 years.  My daughter loves it and it is easier for her to digest and has been known to lesson the occurance of certain allergies in children in given in place of whole milk that is recommended up 'til age 2.  This is my second child that I am using it with and I love it and so do they.
1;"""I do not drink cow milk and was on soy which was sinking me further into estrogen dominance.  Remembering that I had liked goat milk when I had the opportunity to drink it fresh from the goat in my home country.  I started to do some research online to see if it would be a good substitute and what do you know"
1;"""This Cheesecake is easy to make and easy to love!  I love to bake but don't always have the time to start a cheesecake from scratch when I need one.  It's easy to make this unique with adding swirled chocolate sauce or cherries to decorate...I like making the mini ones"
1;Great on the go snack to take in the car for my 3 and 5 year old! NO MESSY HANDS like other snacks. Keeps the car much cleaner! :) Also great for me as a Weight Watcher snack with a wedge of Laughing Cow Lite Cheese! YUM!!!
1;"""Do you seriously need a review for pretzels? It's either going to be  These pretzels are delicious!  or maybe  These pretzels are disgusting!  Thats pretty much all you can say about pretzels. I personally think they are delicious"
1;First thing in the morning it is nice to have a hot cup of coffee to wake you up while you watch the news.  We have always drunk Maxwell house coffee and even when I was a child my parents used it.  It is one of the best coffee brands available.  As we have gotten older we needed to consume less caffeine and we actually brew a mixture of part of this coffee and part of the Maxwell House Decaf blend.  It helps us reduce our caffeine and we still get to enjoy our coffee in the morning with just a little kick in it.<br /><br />The price of the coffee here is about the right list price but the shipping is a killer adder.  On sale at a local store we get it for less than half the price and no shipping.  This is a very good product and I recommend it to you.
1;tastes like v8 cuz it is v8 :o) ... delivered on time... my doctor says i dont get as much nutrition benefit as i thought i did because of the pasteurization process... but i dont eat lots of veggies and i like this stuff sooooo i drink it anyway...
1;I have used Harmony Valley hamburger substitute several times now and have been very happy. It is spiced and tastes pretty close to a meatball mixture. When used in sauce or to stuff peppers I cannot tell that it is not hamburger meat. I was thrilled with its performance and its ease of use.  I can't wait to try it in other recipes.
1;"""Great product!<br /><br />I purchased this product from our local Fresh Market. I am a vegan and am always looking for different  meat  substitutes to try. I used this mix to make some taco mince. This stuff was perfect! I even got my non veg. father to try a bite of the tacos and he thought they were good as well. That right there is saying something"
1;"""Some of my family are vegetarians but the rest are die-hard meat eaters. This is one product that the whole family will eat.  We like it as burgers but we LOVE it as meatloaf and meatballs in spaghetti.  We like that it keeps a good texture even when simmered in sauce.  I love that it has the texture and 'bite' that hamburger has.  As an extra bonus"
1;We just received a package of the hamburger mix from one of our dearest friends as a gift. We loved it. I am vegetarian and my husband is a meat eater. I whipped up some stuffed bell peppers using the mix and it was delicious. I love that it is a great price as well!
1;I have been drinking three cups of this tea for the last month and a half.  I just had my annual checkup with my doctor and my blood pressure was 108/60!!!!  After years of it being it the 140's or 135's my blood pressure is now like a young person and I am in my sixties.  I had been monitoring my blood pressure at home and it was good but usually when I see the doctor it shoots up because I am nervous but not this time.  My doctor was thrilled.  I totally believe that this tea has lowered my blood pressure and I will continue drinking it.  I steep it for 10 minutes.  I have two cups after breakfast and one cup after dinner.  It tastes good and I don't put any sweetener in it.  I highly recommend it as it did work for me.
1;You will not find better tasting soup anywhere.  I initially purchased it because my wife is sensitive to MSG and other kinds of additives that are found in most soups.  After eating some myself I now keep a supply on hand for all of the family.
1;That all that need to be said. The best chocolate candy with the best service. And add a great price and it just can not be beat. The item arrived on time and in good shape like most items ordered through amazon.
1;"""My husband and I love these chips - they aren't very salty and the strip shape makes them great for dipping in salsa/dips.  Two of my favorite things about these chips though: 1) when you open the bag"
1;I bought these for my grandson who is 7 months old. He loves them and they are just the right size for a snack between feedings. His mom likes the convenience and ease in taking them along. I like ordering these and having them shipped directly to their house. It makes me feel like I have sent them a little present that is practical and appreciated.
1;I mix 2 scoops of this and two scoops of formula in my son's bottle and it keeps him full longer. My mother says she used it on me when I was a child and it kept my cheeks rosy and me full. My son seems to really enjoy it.
1;"""I switched to sea salt a couple of years ago and have found these McCormick grinders very handy ways of dispensing. My attraction was the price. This deal is better than any I have found in local grocery stores... even with shipping/handling. Well worth the price. Shipment was fast"
1;"""My Greyhounds 7 and 8 years old( both Brood Matrons) loved this lip smacking food. It has given them more energy and their coats are looking wonderful. In fact when you open the bag the food smells like fruit and veg. Changing to Annamaet grainless Salcha"
1;We lived in Charleston for years and always loved the availability of fresh seafood - especially oysters!  Now we live about 24 hours away and I do miss being able to swing by the seafood market when I'm in the mood.  I had no idea that I could have it delivered to my doorstep within a couple of days!  It was well packed and smelled as fresh as if we bought it off the boat.  Impress your friends and throw together an oyster pasta dish.  SO much better than the stuff in the small plastic containers at the grocery store!  These were HUGE.
1;"""I bought this for my boyfriend as a Valentines Day gift and he absolutely loved it! Its an amazing size and includes all the essentials for a starter kit. It arrived extremely quickly even though i chose standard shipping. It arrived in a medium sized box and alot of packing peanuts which kept the tree stable and safe throughout shipping. Overall"
1;I really enjoy this noodle cup mostly because of the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the soup. The noodles taste firmer and less like the cheap kind that would regularly come out of one of these instant noodle packages. The flavoring has just the right amount of spice and is not excessively spicy.
1;"""If you are concerned about digesting dairy and soy products you can rest assured that this is the protein for you. It's a nice vanilla flavor with no chalkiness and no artificial sweeteners. I love it and I know my body loves it. NO digestion problems"
1;"""This product has 24g of protein per serving and is ideal for getting lean because it has only about 110 calories and practically no fat. The taste is fairly forgettable but not regrettable. If you need a pure bulk"
1;"""Grandpa Po's Originals Slightly Spicy is a wonderful savory organic snack. Not too spicy at first and ends with a great finish. If I had to sum it up in one word it would be  WOW! I would recommend them for young and old alike."""
1;I have previously brought habanero powder from a gourmet store at The Grove in LA.  It was roughly 3 oz for $5.95.  This has the same great flavor and intensity that a habanero powder should have.  We use it to season fried fish and chicken and all braised meat dishes.  I highly recommend buying this product.
1;"""Who knew that when I bought this 4 years ago that I was also getting something good for my health.  Saw a recent Dr. Oz show with Andrew Weil and he had a great Puttanesca recipe and one of the ingredients was dried red pepper.  By the way the recipe is just as good without the tuna.  I sprinkle a little of my Habanero powder as a substitute for the red pepper flakes.<br /><br />You don't need much of the powder it is very good quality"
1;"""This stuff is gold for the hot/spicy food enthusiast.  I put it on most everything other than breakfast (Grape Nuts).  I really think you get way more value from this than any hot sauce in a bottle...  This is basically what is in that fancy bottle hot sauce"
1;"""One of the few chicken jerky type treats out there that's made in the USA (Connecticut) and isn't made in China.  Time and time again there are recalls for these types of treats that come from CHINA.  Do NOT buy treats made in China for your pets!  Sure"
1;"""I bought these for my husband because he occassionally likes a cup of coffee at home and it is a hassle to drag out the coffee maker and grinder when he only wants one cup and it's not everyday.  It also comes in handy when guests come over"
1;"""I like this coffee.  It's much better than instant.  I keep some packs in my desk for those long afternoons and I also started carrying them when I go camping.  If I can go wthout another cup of instant coffee from a jar"
1;Starbucks has once again proven it is the world's best coffee company. Their new VIA instant coffee packets taste great and are portable which gets me through the day. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Starbuck's coffee!!
1;This is definitely a great snack or morning breakfast<br /><br />I tried all the flavors and they were as expected....great<br /><br />if you want a good healthier snack or meal this is the way to go!!!
1;"""I have a very hectic lifestyle and need time to relax. I have always had trouble sleeping as my head is spinning. I have tried lots of methods to try and sleep well but nothing has worked. I saw this product in my local walmart and thought"
1;Butterfinger crips is so good its like eating a really fresh butterfinger. I order online because I had a hard time finding them in the stores. If you like butterfingers you will like butterfinger crisp. A light candybar not to heavy on your stomach.
1;I bought this once at my local grocer and it was so good I went back to get more and it was gone.  I asked the store to get it again and they never did so found it at Amazon.  Placing my second order today since I am down to my last pack.
1;When I lived in Germany I bought this all the time over there. The biggest problem was of course everything was written in German. Since you have a computer just go to a translation website and scan in the instructions and have them changed to English. From there you can use the product.
1;"""I recently invited a baby mini doxie into my family and had an existing 2 lb. chihuahua that the vet constantly told me to try and fatten up. I would try hamburger and cottage cheese and all the things he told me and she would either get a tummy ache or just not gain weight. I bought this food with the doxie in mind and fed it to the chihuahua too and she started to gain weight within the week. I now have to watch the portions i give her or she will over gain. Two healthy dogs with the help of this food. When the doxie gets older"
1;Since I have not been able to eat fat there are many things that I miss eating.  Tortillas were something I ate alot and really missed.  You would never know that these are fat free.  The only complaint that I have is that the tortillas stick together and I have torn many of them.  I would say that in the big picture I would rather have a torn tortilla that no tortilla at all. I plan to reorder when I run out.
1;I ordered these as a gift in June. They tasted great! They did not arrive in picture perfect condition due to the heat but I was contacted by the company to see what they could do for me.  The strength of a company is not found in things that go correctly but rather in the things that go wrong and what they do about them.  I would recommend them highly
1;"""Simply Splendid Chocolate Covered Cherry Cordials! Perhaps the best we have found. I went to their web site and found a large assortment of other chocolates and ordered more from there. They shipped quickly (ordered December 3rd"
1;Was pleasantly surprised at how good these pretzels were.There are 3 servings per bag at 140 calories each.This is about 14 to 15 pretzels.The pretzels are really filling.The bag has approximately 45 pretzels.I was expecting them to be bland since they are made with natural ingredients but they are very flavorful.Made in the USA is a big plus.
1;Five Gum is a new product from Wrigley's. I'm always on the lookout for new gum since I like having something to chew while I'm driving. I came across this back in august and was pleasantly surprised. The flavor lasts a really long time and is relatively strong.
1;"""Sharp orange flavor with a tolerable spearmint taste. I've tried many of the less expensive brands and haven't liked any other except this one and Good Seasons Tuscany. I'm not crazy about all of the Tazo drinks"
1;I had a difficult time trying to find aluminum free baking soda and finally found it on Amazon.  It was shipped quickly and the seller put in several free samples of natural beverage mixes. (which I really appreciated and will use) Very pleased with this product.
1;"""I bought this Baking Soda to clean my teeth 3 times a week.  They say that teeth become noticeably whiter.<br />But you've to to be very gentle while brushing and use  soft  type tooth brush.  I did notice a difference.<br /><br />Also"
1;Bob's Red Mill Baking Soda is an excellent product for baking with or making your own toothpaste.<br />It is aluminum free and free of any other harmful chemicals. We use it as a safe/legal product<br />on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet in healing my boys with ASD and healing my own fibromyalgia<br />as we have difficulty ridding our body of harmful toxins in foods.
1;"""Okay so I bought this product and then had to laugh upon further research discovering that ALL baking soda is aluminum free.  It's baking POWDER that has aluminum in it.  The cheapest baking soda you can find is still aluminum free.  It's still good baking soda though"
1;"""I just called Bob's Red Mill and talked to a representative there.  I was told that the packaging has been changed and no longer states  aluminum free  but  natural .  It would be helpful if Amazon clearly stated that the packaging has been changed by Bob's Red Mill so that one will not be ordering Bob's Red Mill Aluminum Free Baking Soda when this is no longer an item.  It would save wasted time by customers who are trying to rectify  what was sent when it appears that a name change took place.  It would also spare vendors from receiving less than excellent reviews."""
1;I have a lemongrass plant in my yard. I make tea from it but I wanted convenient tea bags to take to work or drink whenever I wanted. The tea from this box tastes exactly the same. It is some of the best tea I have ever tasted. I prefer to drink it hot but it can be made cold. It is such a relaxing beverage. I can drink it before bed because it has no caffeine. I highly recommend this tea.
1;Ordered these seeds for a recipe that I got from my grandmother. Seeds came very quickly and well packaged. Much cheaper than buying all those small bottles at the grocery store. Would definatly use this company again.
1;Our cats just love this stuff.  They eat the Ultra Premium dry food and Ocean Fish canned food.  We've given them some of the other formulas and they'd slowly eat them but they won't leave the Ocean Fish alone.
1;I love silken tofu and use it a lot to make smoothies for myself and my toddlers. This is good-quality silken tofu and I was happy with the price and convenience of having it delivered to my door. (It's hard to find in grocery stores around here!)
1;I am practicing a vegan diet and this is an excellent product with a very good shelf life. I also buy some tofu that you can keep in refrigerator (which cost me $0.99/ea + tax). But I like to take this one with me when I travel and just to have some on hand at home (in case I run out of refrigerated tofu). Excellent product!
1;"""We do pet adoptions and also run a shelter for cats. I personally own 7 cats!!! I have absolutely never had a problem with feeding these to any of my cats.<br /><br />They have NEVER vommited from this treat"
1;It is amazing to see the even split on reviews. I have a Ragdoll cat who was having the occasional hairball. He loves these treats and has only had one hairball since (shortly after starting these). I couldn't be happier with the product.<br /><br />I got them at Walmart. The current amazon seller seems to be a rip off.
1;"""My cat is very picky and this is the only hairball remedy that I can give him that he eats and it works!  I don't have a problem with him vomiting at all.  I give him about 8-10 treats per day (and you have to make sure that you are giving them on an empty stomach)"
1;"""My 13 year old cat wants to skip meals....all he wants is Whiskas Temptations!  He particularly LOVES the ones for hairball control.  He will find the place that they are stored and either knock then off a table or come to me"
1;"""One day my husband and I were at Costco.  They had the Oak Hill Farms Vidalia Onion Vinaigrette on the shelf.  I said  wow  this really looks good but I put it back on the shelf.  When we got to the check-out stand"
1;"""These taste just as good as Triscuits in my opinion.<br />I have not found them to be overly salty.<br />I buy these as a cheaper alternative.<br /><br />If you want to know the source of any of the ingredients"
1;I've been using this all natural cat food for a few years when I could afford it but didn't think to shop where I buy my books.  With free shipping I only wish Amazon offered a few more flavors.  Since many commercial cat foods are made with Grade D mest (not fit for human consumption) I am delighted to have this choice.
1;I have found this cat food to be the purrfect choice for both my cat with IBD and my cat with Diabetes. Howard and Miss C are thriving on this diet of Turkey and brown rice and  enjoy it so much more than prescription diets. The price was great too for a premium cat food.
1;"""I just got this and so far my finicky cat loves it!<br />One of my friends recommended I try this for my cat as she has allergies<br />that we think are food allergies and so far nothing else has helped.<br />Friend's cat no longer has allergies on this food and I hope the same for mine"
1;We always drink Timmothy's or Emeril's. Thought we would try something different. Not too many decafs to choose from. We were pleasantly surprised that this had a great taste with a full bodied flavor. I like my coffee on the milder side so I can even get 2 cups from 1 Kcup.
1;I tried this flavor within a variety pack and LOVED IT!  I usually add cream and sugar to my coffee.  With this k cup I added coconut creamer and found that I did not have to add any sugar!  It was so sweet and light and tasted just like a pina colada.  I absolutley love this k cup and am planning to sign up for subscribe and save on this one!
1;"""I wasn't expecting this one to be so rich or full!  Yet it has a smoky finish that is typical of a French roast but doesn't taste burnt.  I think alot of times a French roast tastes thin and yet bitter instead of full and smoky"
1;This is my wife's favorite. She grew up in Seattle and has consumed countless gallons of various types of coffee in her lifetime so I assume this is good coffee. She is also my wine taster as her palate is much more sensitive than mine.
1;It's a great flavor and makes a great cup of coffee. I fine you can have more than 1 cup of this coffee and not feel like it's too much of a flavored coffee. Puck has captured a great flavor with this coffee.
1;We purchased an assorted package of K-Cups (by various makers) and of all the coffees THIS is my FAVE!  I really can't see any reason to ever taste-test another flavor!  It smells delicious and TASTES DELICIOUS too!!
1;This is a favorite in the office and in my house. We burn through this coffee. I've tried a few of the other Wolfgang coffees and this one is by far the best. I've seen better prices for this at a lot of other places. This is an excellent coffee to start your day with.
1;"""BEEN TRYING EVERY COFFEE BRAND AND FLAVOR FOR OVER A YEAR NOW AND THIS IS IT.  I JUST LOVE THIS COFFEE.  YOU SHOULD TRY A SMALL BOX AND SEE IF YOU AGREE.  EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT TASTE FOR COFFEE SO YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT"
1;"""This is great coffee.  I am a coffee purist.  I don't add cream or sugar (unless it is weak or bitter). I truly enjoy coffee.  I have tried many different types of coffee for K-cups.  This is my new favorite. The price was amazing too.  Very smooth and subtle hazelnut flavor"
1;"""Reading the previous comments people have stated they did not know this was a flavored coffee but it clearly states that it is. Atleast it did on the sight I bought mine from. I was only brought to Amazon for the secure payment feature. It's a delightful flavored coffee"
1;"""There is so many different K- Cup to chose from. So I asked in the store what brand and flavor is bought the most. They suggested Wolfgang Puck Coffee - Breakfast in Bed. The only had a few on the shelf and I was not disappointed. Now I am hooked. For you people that use creamer"
1;"""I am not a huge morning coffee person as this seems to be the only time of day black coffee upsets my stomach. No idea why. My work got a Keurig recently and buy the Caribou regular and morning blends"
1;Have enjoyed every single cup of Breakfast in Bed. Just the right kind of brew to wake up these old bones and get me started on the day's adventure. Also enjoy it while watching NCIS so I can join Gibbs enjoying a brew as well.
1;"""WOW! That's what my husband said when he tasted Wolfgang Puck's 'Jamaica Me Crazy' coffee for my Keurig.  He is not a fan of 'Strong' coffees and he really liked this one - We both do.  I highly recommend this one.  Can you put it on the Subscribe and Save??<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXL0V6 >Wolfgang Puck Coffee"
1;I have at least 4 dozen different k-cups at my house right now because we love to experiment with different flavors.  My favorite is Timothy's Rainforest Espresso because I like a bold coffee.  But others that prefer something milder say that Breakfast in Bed is their favorite.  I like it to but only when made as a stronger brew.  I have purchased maybe 15 boxes of this since it came out.
1;"""I was surprised to find out the coffee from my sampler had coconut in it.  I bought a sampler of k-cups to try different flavors and would sit aside the ones that I liked to order in the future.<br /><br />After drinking Jamaica Me Crazy not realizing the ingredients just knowing I liked it.  When ordering"
1;"""Light and flavorful definitely describes this K-Cup. I often find it hard to find flavored K-Cups that aren't either 1) so strong you lose the flavor or 2) so light you'd be better off drinking water. However"
1;This is my #1 favorite coffee. Blending of hazelnut and coconut are perfect.  Thank you!!<br /><br />Question:  why was I charged postage on this brand when I have never paid on any other brand of K-Cups from Amazon
1;I bought this coffee for my Keurig coffee maker and I really like it. Smooth  and the best thing it is an organic. Wolfgang uses the the best beans for his coffee's. Buy you will be pleasantly surprised.
1;I like full-bodied coffee and to try something different to supplement the standard one I use.  This coffee was perfect for that purpose. Timothy's Rainforest Expresso is still my standard one...but I will order this again.
1;I am having a blast with my new Keurig machine - trying out a bunch of new flavors including the Dark Roast. It's nice and flavorful - particularly since I run each of my cups through the small cup brewing cycle 2 times to fill my large mug.  This works.<br />Tried the chocolate donut flavor the other day and loved it.<br />Love the convenience and bargain prices of the subscribe & save.
1;"""This coffee is Bold and none of the bitterness that is usually found in bold coffee's.  It also scored exeptional in the single serve coffee ratings and I concur.  There is a lot of dreck out there in K-Cups"
1;I love coffee with no bitterness and lots of good coffee taste and this one fits the bill. Holds up well to milk & sugar-I love it in the morning for the first cup and in the evening just as much. Definitely would buy it again.
1;This is a fantastic decaf coffee. My parents love decaf but there aren't many out there they enjoy. We've been drinking Timothy's decaf Colombian and we bought this to try it. Fantastic! I would definitely buy this again and again. It's smooth and not bitter. It's not super strong so don't expect it to be like a cappacino. This is a really great Colombian cup of coffee. You won't miss the caffiene.
1;I like my coffe of the milder but tasteful side.  I thought this was a great cup of coffe I compare it to Timothy's dounut shoppe.  Full flavor but not acid.  This is for people who want a lighter cup of coffee
1;I like a dark rich coffee and this is a tad different.  It seems much smoother and<br />I tend to nearly crave it when I have a slightly acid stomach.  It sounds odd and<br />I know I drink too much coffee but this fills that acid tummy niche.
1;"""We love our Keurig coffeemaker and have tried many coffees.  Recently discovered Wolfgang Puck's new line of coffees and are pleased with all of his we have tried.  This one is smooth with a great flavor"
1;"""This one will not disappoint!  I got this yesterday and my husband and I tried it this morning with breakfast and we both loved it.  I have gotten many different kinds of the k-cups to try but after trying this one"
1;I have tried several decaf K-cubs and have found this to be the best. My husband does not like decaf but has finally found this one he will drink because it has a little bolder taste.I find it a good coffee to have in the house for company because everyone seems to like it. I will be ordering it again and again!
1;This coffee is for those who like a strong robust flavor. Nothing wimpy about it. I like just enough cocoa mix and creamer to take off the edge. My husband goes for the gusto. Great wake-me-up-in-the-morning brew. Love it!
1;I want to try other types of coffee but I am so stuck on this one that it's hard to try anything else!  This is a mild roast.  Medium or dark roast is too strong for me these days.  The hazelnut flavor it very nice and every cup brewed is superb.  I have been drinking this Wolfgang Puck Hawaiian Hazelnut for at least 6 months and it never fails to please.  Give it a try :)
1;"""I used to eat tofu almost every. And i havn't had those for a while.<br />So i was searching and i was actually surprised that amzon has tofu!<br />I was Half-curious and Half-pleased!So i bought it..and i don't regret it.<br />It's Organic"
1;I use this in place of mayo for many recipes when I need something creamy and quick.  This also works very nice for sweet dishes as there is very little taste to the tofu and it does absorb flavors well like a chocolate pie.
1;"""A nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc. as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners.  Stevia is made from herb in South America. Japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said.  It's quite a bit sweeter than sugar"
1;I love passion fruit juice and this is a very good product. Each bottle makes about a gallon. It is low in sugar and low on glycemic index. Has a lot of potassium and is a natural relaxer. Makes great cocktails too if it isn't relaxing enough for you straight up! Fast delivery and great product!
1;"""I love this tea. I hated my friends asking me if I was pregnant. I decided to diet but wasn't easy. I was always hungry and at bedtime I couldn't help it and ended up with a plate of ice cream... no good. I decided to give this tea a try and I stopped feeling hungry all the time. The taste is great. I have lost ten pounds in almost two months. I walked al least an hour per day"
1;My husband and I found this rub in a little market in Philly a few years ago.  We have since purchased it religiously since.  It adds great flavor to steaks that now can't eat a steak without it.  It is definitely a must try!
1;"""I was skeptical because I've seen mixed reviews on similar products like this.  But I'm glad I jumped in and decided to purchase it.  First of all the shipping was fast and it comes gift-wrapped free which is cool.  Second"
1;"""I like to use walnut oil in salad dressings and in baking.  It's delicious when added to pancakes and muffin mixes in lieu of regular vegetable oil.  It adds just a hint of flavor without being overwhelming.  And with the price that Amazon offers it for vs. what my local grocery store charges for a smaller amount"
1;This walnut oil is the best on the market. It has been roasted which enhances the walnut flavor. I love it with scrambled eggs and in preparing rice dishes. I've even used it to condition my hair! I completely trust Roland Foods because they are superior in every way.
1;Medaglia D'Oro Instant Espresso Coffee is by far the best way to make a latte in the comfort of your home and it's also the cheapest!  I use it to make an awesome vanilla latte - just put two (2) spoonfuls of the Medaglia D'Oro espresso in a coffee cup and add about 2 shots of hot water and mix.  Place a shot of vanilla syrup in a tall glass(more or less according to individual taste). Next add enough cubed [not crushed]ice to fill the glass 2/3rds of the way up.  Then fill the glass with enough cold milk to cover the ice.  Pout the hot coffee mix over the milk and ice and stir vigorously until mixed.  Add more ice as needed and then pour enough half and half to color the coffee mix to a yummy caramel color.  Delicious and cheaper than the espresso stands (once you have the ingredients on hand).  Medaglio is also great in recipes that call for instant espresso.  Not all stores carry this product so I order from Gristedes through Amazon.com.
1;"""This instant coffee is a versatile ingredient. You can add it to ice cream you are freezing (or gelato or sorbet) or you can add it to chocolate icing to make mocha flavor. It is the ingredient to have when the recipe calls for  one cup of strong"
1;This is a great product when in a hurry!  I'm surprised at the price though.  My store sells it for $3.49 bottle.  When I'm traveling I can usually find this at Mexican markets even cheaper.  I love Amazon - usually their products are less expensive than buying at stores.
1;I bought this because none of the instant coffee was strong enough for me and was tired of waiting in line at Starbucks. I tried it and couldn't believe it! I am so hooked on this product and hope that my local grocery store continues to stock it.
1;"""I wanted to have an instant coffee for work.  I don't like the standard company coffee at work. I came across Medaglia D'Oro in a HEB store in Houston.  It just looks more interesting than coffee.  I was actually hoping it wouldn't be as strong as espresso but not as watered down as instant coffee. I am glad I bought it.  It has the same consistency at espresso but not as strong in taste.  I am probably using more water that what is suggested on the directions.  I work 3rd shift"
1;"""these arrived very quickly & i was excited to see how the pups would like them.  i like that there are so many in the package.  i've always held in high regard anything rawhide & sweet potato so this was a no brainer....our pups love both!  these sticks are the best!  they incorporate chewing"
1;This sauce has one of the best flavors I've ever tasted.  There's a good balance between spice and garlic.  It has decent heat and tastes good on a lot of things.  I'm not a big fan of most Habanero sauces due to the extra bitterness of the pepper but this sauce blends everything perfectly.
1;This cookies are so good. There very close to my grandmothers home baked cookies but gluten free. This cookies are soft which I like in chocolate chip cookies but might be a little chew for some people I think there GREAT. Very happy.
1;"""Cats are finicky animals and what one loves another won't touch - that is not a reflection on the food itself. I have two Burmese and their eating habits are very different. My local Pet Nutrition Center kindly gave me a sample of Prowl the other day and while my one cat absolutely loves it"
1;My dogs absolutely love this. I have been looking for a natural healthy food to store in my camper in case of emergency. Last year with all the wildfires I decided to load my camper as a quick bug out vehicle for me and my three dogs. I have been vacum sealing thier dry blue buffalo kibble but it takes up a lot of room. I read a review about this dehydrated dog food from a person takes thier dog camping all time and this was the perfect solution for them and decided to give it a try. My dogs let me know its supper time when I get home now because they are all about this food.
1;"""I've always wanted to go to a raw diet for my Cairn but in its frozen form it took up too much room in our RV fridge/freezer as we travel/camp a lot!  A friend recently told me about Addiction and this is the answer for us - takes up little space in our cupboard and provides a healthy diet"
1;"""I started out by purchasing the 4 oz trial package of Summer Brushtail and my little girl absolutely LOVED it!!  Now I am getting the larger package so we don't run out.  My Chinese Crested suffers allergies to poultry and grains and was pretty much limited to a red meat diet.  Since she is a hairless variety she was on a red meat formula coated in herring oil for her skin.  The herring left her with fish breath all the time.  This is a great alternative to the fish because the richness in omega 3 and 6 fatty acids and no more fish breath!!  Since she has been on this her skin quality is much better.  This is also great to mix with kibble if you have a picky little eater like I do"
1;"""This is really the best decaf I have tried... It is hard to find any better than the italian decafs like this one or Illy. Unless of course you are the average local coffee drinker used to embarassments like Folgers or accustomized to all the overburned and stinking like charcoal brands named for an unknown reason French Roast"
1;Finally a GREAT decaf. It has a really wonderful and complete flavor- not like a lot of the decafs on the market that are just missing the kick. I use a Jura Capresso super automatic to make my espresso- it works lovely in the bypass funnel on this machine (since it is pre-ground). The flavor stands up nice to milk for capuccinos and lattes. This is my every day decaf espresso. I haven't found anything better and I've tried a lot. The Illy decaf is comperable in flavor/ quality but at about double the price the Illy just isn't worth it.
1;I know nothing about this CO2 method of decaffeinating but thought I would give this a try. I usually buy the Swiss water processed. This had a wonderful chocolatey taste. It also claimed to be 99.9% caffein free. Hopefully this is all true because it really is the best I have tried of decaf.
1;I've always enjoyed the decaf at a little Italian restaurant in our downtown area.  I noticed that their affiliated deli sold LavAzza and I asked if that is what they brewed for the restaurant and was told yes.  I immediately went to Amazon and ordered and I am not sorry.  What a great price for an excellent cup of coffee!  Now I get the restaurant flavor without spending the restaurant price!
1;I have tried many of the Lavazza blends as I MUST have my morning cappuccino and can't be without a good espresso blend.  My hubby only drinks decaf and we have found this blend to be just as good as the regular blend Lavazza.  Many times I blend it 1/2 and 1/2 for a late day pick-me-up.  Wouldn't be without it.
1;I recently visited Paris and when I came back to the States I couldn't drink the coffee. So I found a French website that had some great brands but it cost and arm and a leg to send them here. LavAzza was one of the Italian coffees on the French website and I found it here on Amazon!! So now I can have excellent espresso for a decent price!!! Thank you Amazon!!!
1;I just used this to make myself an espresso and it was one of the best tastes of coffee that I've ever had.  I was absolutely surprised but it was sooo good.  I can't wait until the morning so I can have another cup (or two).  Yum!
1;my dog loves these small biscuits plain. she loves playing with them and then eating them. i tried the fancy flavored ones and she seemed to not really care for those. then i bought some more of the plain small biscuits and she was happy again. they help keep the teeth clean and to freshen the breath. they have 12 minerals and vitamins. they add some variety to her diet. i am very happy with this product.
1;"""Cobblestone Kitchen's Irish Creme Hot Cocoa mix has got to be the most luxurious tasting cocoa on the market.  We originally bought this cocoa to use as a base for Frappuccinnos but quickly decided it was way to good to waste in a mix.  The flavor is rich and smooth.  We have made it a part of our winding down for bed time procedure - a couple of cups together and just relax.<br /><br />Cobblestone Kitchen refers to the cocoas as  Delicious and Decadent   and they are being extremely modest."""
1;"""We have a little Maltese that we spoil to no end.  These treats are the perfect size for him and he loves them.<br /><br />He can be a little picky.  Among his daily treats are Greenies and since we found these on Amazon"
1;"""I'm constantly looking for healthy dog treats that are not crazy expensive.  These are one of the better deals I could find when considering cost/ounce.  My Lab absolutely loves them and they are good for him too.  The treats are soft and moist"
1;"""These treats are excellent. I have a chihuahua who has done obedience training and is now in agility training. I use the treats to aid with his training as they are easy to break into small pieces yet big enough for me to carry in my pocket and grab easily.<br /><br />They have NEVER made him sick no matter how many he eats during a training session and he goes absolutely NUTS when he hears me open the bag.<br /><br />I've purchased the smaller sized treats by Zukes"
1;"""The Lamb Jerky soft treats are the first product we tried from Zuke's.  They were a big hit and continue to be one of my little schnoodle's favorite treats.<br />Soft jerky squares (approx 1 ) can easily be split into 3-4 pieces.  We use them for her training/play sessions and she seems to especially love it when the reward is the Zuke's soft lamb jerky.<br />Although she performs just as eagerly when the reward is the <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00292BM7C >Zuke's 16-Ounce Mini Bakes Dog Treats"
1;My dog loves Zuke's treats and this one is no acceptation. He did not like them as much as the chicken but they still keep his interest. I will be cutting them up to use at puppy class. Zukes are the only thing other than hotdogs that will get his attention.
1;I am impressed with the quality of these dog treats.  Amazon seems to sell these treats for the best price and I will continue to order these in the future.  My dog really likes the lamb variety and they smell very good.  I reccommend these to any animal lover!
1;"""Our two dogs just love these treats.  One old and one younger but both are active.  The older dog's teeth aren't the best. These treats are easy for him to chew.  It seems like the younger one swallows them whole he's so eager to get them!  Oh"
1;My minature schnauzer loves these treats!  I sometimes get the mini treats in chicken so I can give him a few throughout the day or on walks - I do not want him to get overweight since he is a small boy.  I would highly recommend them:)
1;These are nice little training treat sized cookies that can easily be gobbled by my 50 and 75lb dogs.  I imagine they'd work good too for the smaller dogs as a more regular sized treat.  They are about the size of a nickel each.
1;"""Coffee pods used to be sold in Safeway and Target etc. stores in my area. In the last year the pods have not been stocked in favor of the new single brewer style K-Cup. While I can locate many sources on the internet I have found that quickest delivery at a reasonable price is buying Senseo from Amazon.<br />Mostly a French Vanilla drinker I find the taste is consistant"
1;I purchased these pods using Amazon's subscribe and save program for the first time this year.  The order was received promptly and the pods were fresh and very flavorful.  I have used this flavor coffee pods since January 2007 and have not been disappointed ever.  Hopefully I will be able to continue receiving them from Amazon.
1;I enjoy flavored coffees.  French Vanilla is a favorite.  I only wish Senseo would offer more flavor varieties. It would also be nice if a variety of flavored coffees could be sold as a pack of 6 (example 3 hazelnut and 3 French vanilla or 2 of 3 different varieties). These pods are easy to use and cheaper than area store prices.  It's more convenient to purchase online.  Not all stores carry pods for Senseo coffee makers.
1;We go through a lot of this flavor.  Love the Senseo machine and their customer service.  Love the ability to use different flavors of coffee and tea.  Everyone can have their favorite in seconds.  We just use a lot of the French Vanilla.
1;"""This is the third Senseo brand coffe pod I have tried and it is my absolute favorite. I have tried Vanilla flavored coffees from several major gourmet coffee dealers and to me this coffee has the best Vanilla taste of them all. It is great to use in a single-serve type brew system or in a small 4-5 cup brewer [which is what I use]. The pod makes cleaning the brew basket a breeze and yet there is sufficient amount of grounds to give a good strength to the brew. I don't like my coffee as strong as some"
1;Phew!  Am I glad I found these Senseo Paris French Vanilla Caramel Bistro Coffee Pods!  All of my local stores either do not carry them anymore or are charging over $5 for one 16-count bag.  The 6 bag pack should easily cover the 3 month subscription time frame as I only use one pod a day.  The other great thing is that the package's expiration date is many months in the future so I know they are fresh!  I highly recommend subscribing to the automatic re-order system. Thank you Amazon.com!
1;This is really the way to go. Add some creamer to further enhance the flavor of this blend. I signed up for a subscription to have this delivered every month. I drink some every morning at work. Works great with the B&D Home Cafe system.
1;"""We got our Senseo coffee maker through a promotion. I had always wanted to try it out. I purchased a variety of coffee pods and my husband and I tried them out. We have yet to be disappointed. We love it so much"
1;If you have not tried this combination you really should totally awesome flavor mix great on roast pork or to just dip pretzels in or put it over cream cheese and use crackers<br />Would buy again great service and got here sooner than expected
1;I've used this brand for years. If you're feeling clogged up or ate a massive meal have a few sips of this tea.  If you're new to it make sure you're home because it can work a little too well if you know what I mean.  Just be careful the first couple of times using it and try little sips.  You'll see a result by morning or earlier if you follow it with lots of water.
1;"""I have tried them all - from the top name brands to the baked cheese crisps that seem to have become the craze these days. These cheese puffs simply take the cake! Not only do the pack all the flavor and texture one would want"
1;"""I had a recipe that called for a lot of dark chili powder and the only place I could find it was amazon.com.  I bought a jar of this and it made two batches of the chili recipe I have.  The chili was the best I'd ever made.  I can vouch that this chili powder really does make a big difference in the flavor of a chili.  It is rich with a bit of a kick.  Everyone has been crazy for it"
1;"""We drink this coconut water every day in our house. It's become somewhat of an obsession. We used to have a subscription to the 12 pack of vitacoco and when that ran out we tried this instead. I like it better. It tastes cleaner though I can't describe what's different about it"
1;I come from that part of asian subcontinent named after the coconut tree.Coconut trees are in abundance and we use every part of the tree imaginable. when we want a refreshing drink we just pluck a tender coconut off the tree.  What i wanted to tell u is that I am a difficult nut to crack when it comes to coconut water. And I love the One.
1;"""I was buying this product and others like it in the 11.5 boxes but it saves a lot of money to purchase it in the 1 liter packages.  The taste is great and the product was very fresh with a good shelf life.  Since I have a Prime Account"
1;"""I love this product. I wanted something healthy and good tasting that didn't have added sugar or chemical sweeteners as an alternate to water. This is it. I like this coconut water better than others I have tried. It isn't as sweet as the Amy & Brian brand"
1;it is too bad that I can't find this product locally any longer.  It was a favorite in our household.  Now my source is Amazon and I'm just as happy with that as I was before.  It has a great flavor that is long lasting.
1;"""I ordered two....The Monterey - Double Trunk-Preserved Bonsai Tree &  The Artificial Aralia Bonsai Tree.<br /><br />Both trees came packed so as to not move around in the box.<br />They spray foam around the base and let it cure in the box. It creates a very stable platform.<br />The trees are absoulutely gorgeous!!!!<br />They look very close to the pics they show here.<br />Since they are hand made"
1;"""We have purchased two trees and both were gifts.  The first tree was thoroughly packaged with some type of foam insulation totally surrounding the tree. Impressive. Excellent condition!  The second tree came with no insulation but with a cord attaching the tree to the bottom of the box.  A couple of small limbs were broken off.  It is much better packaging with the foam insulation.<br /><br />The gift was  assumed  by the recipiant to be artificial (fake)"
1;"""This makes for a great centerpiece on a dining room/coffee table as well as a great conversation piece!  I have to convince friends that this isn't a real live Bonsai tree when they see it.  It's very convincing"
1;i usually make my own fondant but decided to give this one a try.it was an absolute pleasure working with fondarific wedding white.since its cold here at the moment the fondant arrived stone hard so i had to break some apart with a knife and heat in the microwave for ten seconds after which it was great working with it.im not a professorial and i have to say that this fondant was very easy to roll out and cover a two tiered cake.
1;I purchased this fondant for a wedding cake that I was making.  I have tried numerous brands and even made my own fondant.  This Fondarific fondant is easy to work with.  I am an amateur baker and will purchase this product again.
1;I used this fondant to create dice to add to cupcakes for a Bunko for the Cure fundraiser.  They came out awesome and were a huge hit!  The fondant color was bright white and worked great with the Wilton food markers (for the dots on the dice).  This fondant is so incredibly easy to work with and it tasted delicious.  Even the non-fondant lovers in the crowd (including me) loved the taste! I look forward to using this product again....and again....and again!
1;This was my first time using Fondarific and fondant in general. This one was really easy to use for a baby shower cake. It worked just as indicated. I also colored it and made a two tier cake (baby blue and white). the final product looked great not greasy.
1;"""I live in a small city in Illinois and it is very hard to find certain products. I was so pleased to see this product. I watch so many programs on the food network..Neely's being one. I wanted this product to make their rub. When it arrived..quickly I may add..you could smell the powerful scent through the package. It was wonderful..strong aroma"
1;Wow smoked sweet paprika is extremely hard to find in stores luckly I was able to find this huge container of smoked paprika for a really good price. I found that it was a really good spice to use and it makes food taste as if you grilled it on a charcoal grill which is awesome. Give it a shot you might like it.
1;"""I've been trying to find a good paprika for a rub used in the smoker. This stuff is the absolute best that I've found. It's sweet but still has all the flavor you want from paprika without being overly smoky. If you make homemade rubs"
1;"""This is one of the best mixed nut blends I have ever had!<br />Everything tastes extremely fresh and natural. The flavor combination is amazing - perfect mix of nuts and dried fruits. I really like that this blend doesn't include peanuts - I'm tired of nut blends always including peanuts... enough already! This was a refreshing change and a great snack.<br />I also feel the price is reasonable - considering there are no peanuts"
1;"""I got these for me and my boyfriend to try but he refused to try it with me... at first. I tried to explain to him that it's just fruit put in a pill form but he was convinced it was some type of trick I was trying to pull on him. Anyways so I went to the store and picked up some lemons"
1;My daughter had  me buy these for her 18th birthday party.  What a success!  The tablets arrived ahead of schedule so we could concentrate on other items.  The kids had a fun time trying out sour foods that became sweet after letting the tablets melt in their mouth. Everyone had a great time and really enjoyed them.  We're recommending them to everyone!
1;"""I ordered these after hearing about them from some friends. I was very skeptical if it would even really work noticeably and was even more skeptical about the  pill form . But WOW! They really do work! It makes anything bitter or sour taste instantly sweet. I tried a few things and could definitely tell they were sweeter. But the most noticeable was the lemon. I really didn't even want to try it at first but i was told i had to. It tasted like the sweetest and most flavorful lemonade ever. Seriously"
1;I got these tablets to try them out to see if they really worked and to my suprise they do and they made lemons taste amazing. Most of the other items on the list did not taste much better to me but I am still trying some out.
1;Make sure you salivate a lot and don't swallow for best results. They'll typically last a few hours. They're a big hit for guests. You can even get by with half after you've had one or two. Doesn't work too well on liquors but most sour and acidic foods there is a very noticeable effect.
1;"""This product makes me want to buy a Miracle Fruit tree so I can have these awesome berries all the time.<br /><br />The biggest changes my husband and I noticed were in eating fruits & other berries. Store-bought strawberries"
1;"""I just bought the mberry with slight concerns that it will not work. All those concerns went away when I tried it. It was a tingly feeling at first where ever it was on the tongue. I didn't notice anything. First thing i tried was a grape. I mean this was the most delicious grape I had ever tasted. I started try all the fruits and sodas i could. Amazing. People don't realize that you should use it on fruits and things with acidity. It is supposed to make them sweeter. Although it did make one of my cookies sweeter it wasn't nearly as dramatic as when I ate a lime. It tasted like lime-ade. I wouldn't suggest eating a bunch of lemons because this only affects your tongue. Not your stomach. When you buy these you run the risk that it won't work"
1;"""I've had this a few times before and it is amazing. Last time I had it a half pill was one dose so I thought this was a bit cheaper than it turned out to be but it's still great and well worth it at $2 per dose. I like that it also came with some recommended foods to try. Lemons and limes are by far the best"
1;"""I was curious and decided to buy this product because of it (and despite the price).  It worked and is SERIOUSLY cool.  I followed the directions by putting a whole tablet on my tongue and letting it completely dissolved.  Sliced up a lemon and very warily put it in my mouth just to find that it tasted like a sweet lemonade.  There was only a slight tinge of sour.  I would have happily KEPT eating lemons"
1;"""This is my first time with the miracle berries in general. We got a bunch of friends over and everyone brought something. Oranges taste like the orange slice candies. And lemons taste like lemon drops. My favorite is the Christmas Beers that are available this time of year"
1;"""This has a very dark chocolate flavor that mixes quickly and smoothly in hot water. No chucks like most of the other brands. Milk chocolate is fine for those who enjoy that but for real chocolate lovers that enjoy the true flavor of dark chocolate"
1;This product is out of this world - if you like chocolate and you like peppermint - you will fall in love with this.  I had it years ago and never could find it again until this past Christmas time at Costco as a seasonal item.  So when I found this I stocked up.<br />I love it..........
1;"""I purchased this product as a gift for my mom who simply loves this cocoa.  When the local supermarket where she purchased the cocoa stopped stocking it she figured that was the end of it.  Ha!  Little did she know that I would find a way to track it down on line.  And on Amazon!  She was surprised and pleased.  The price is good"
1;Without a doubt this cannot be surpassed. I am always so conscientious about calorie count until I took a sip of this. I will just ration it for special moments. Even the cat's nose was twitching from the delightful scent. It is hard to believe that it was made in USA. If my daughter is lucky I might send her some at Christmas. It is a good thing I live alone or else I would have to hide it.
1;If you haven't tried the Stephens Candycane cocoa you need to try it  but only if you like chocolate and mint flavors.  It's great tasting.  The only problem is that I want it year around and it is only available in stores at Christmas.
1;My husband is a huge fan of hot cocoa.  I surprised him with a 6-pack of Stephen's Peanut Butter Cup Hot Cocoa.  It actually has little peanut butter cups in it.  They quickly melt into this delicious treat.  We highly recommend this product and will buy it again.
1;"""I bought this hot chocolate at a grocery store because it looked interesting.  We like to drive around our neighborhood and look at the Christmas lights.  I always like to drink hot chocolate while enjoying this outing.  Oh My Gosh!  This hot chocolate was incredible. When I opened the can to make it"
1;"""These folks are right.  This stuff is very rich and we just use skim milk.  Richer than the expensive chocolate shavings we have splurged on in the past.  The tins go along ways too.  The per serving cost is a fraction of buying the individual packets at the grocery store of other brands"
1;Has just enough of the raspberry taste without being over bearing. Will purchase more in the future when my supple depletes.  I had trouble finding a good raspberry hot cocoa but now I know where to get it.  This site will be one of my favorites.
1;"""do you like dark chocolate?  wish you could find quality dark chocolate cocoa mix?  this is the real deal!  i have tried a few different  dark  chocolate mixes.  this one stands above others in it's smooth'ness and creamy quality.  nice and dark"
1;"""I ordered this about a year ago and have repeatedly ordered it since. Everyone I have shared it with has loved it so much they have also gotten right on Amazon and ordered it also. I mix it in my coffee"
1;I bought a can of Stephen's hot cocoa over 5 years ago not realizing how good it was going to be. After I drank the first few cups I was hooked and could not find it anywhere again. I ordered it directly from the company for several years and even took several cans to the UK with me when we moved over taking care to make them last. I'm very glad to find this brand on amazon as it's rich flavor surpasses all others I've tried. If you love dark chocolate this is it. I haven't tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good. I may order some for stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br /><br />I also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug/cup. The pre-measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an 8oz cup and most mugs are 12oz so 2 packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way. If you'd like very rich hot chocolate you can use 1/2 milk and 1/2 water. You really don't need marshmallows.
1;"""I don't think there is a better hot cocoa (especially at this price)on the market than Stephen's. It lasted me the entire winter and made for awesome x-mas gifts. Now everyone I know buys it and I'm even happier to be spreading it around. My only issue is that I wish they would have a mixed pack"
1;"""The belgian dark chocolate is the best hot cocoa I've ever had so far and my 4 year daughter agrees.  She pinicky about her chocolates preferring only to eat dark chocolate and this dark choco. hot cocoa sure passed the test with her.  She prefers to drink it with just warm water instead of milk as using milk makes it taste like  milk chocolate .  I do"
1;"""Stephen's is absolutely the BEST hot chocolate I have ever tasted!  It is so creamy and delicious.  Every flavor I've ever tried is excellent.  My whole family loves it.  I don't know any stores in the area that sell it"
1;"""My senses were surprised by the aroma of the glistening beans as well as the satisfying flavor of the brew.<br />I substituted this bean when Amazon dropped Starbucks Sumatra from their Subscribe & Save program.<br />Now I would never go back.<br />I use a ceramic cone drip filter into a Nissan Thermal Carafe for our brew.<br />For an organic bean"
1;"""I was crazy about these as a kid! They are tubes simply filled with a flavored powdered candy that has tons of sugar in it. I first tried their cute little wax paper tubes that were about 8 inches long when I was about 7 years old. Goes to figure that my 8 year old is nuts about these now. We used to take our change to the local conveniance store. They came in grape"
1;"""There has been no alteration to the formula.  These confectionery treats taste just like they did in 1978 when I first used to pour them into my mouth.  And since they are wrapped in smaller packages of three sticks (oh sorry"
1;"""I bought this for my Guinea Pig and he LOVES it.<br /><br />Its insanely easy to grow. It seems like it grows an inch by the second. 1 square will definitely last me for more than a few weeks.<br /><br />If you're looking to grow your own wheat grass"
1;I was having trouble finding pet grass consistently in my area and decided to take a chance using a grow kit. The kit was very easy to use and the grass grew like crazy. Since I have only one cat I am now using about 1/3 of planting soil and seeds at a time and this works out great. I highly recommend this product.
1;I sent this to my daughter and son as a gift for the holidays and New Years Eve. They loved these very much. Nice gift to be shared with many people.<br />The liquor filled chocolates arrived in perfect condition and were securely but attractively packaged.
1;"""Very much satisfied! The box of chocolate arrived just in time for the party. Everyone enjoyed them so much that I am putting in another order for new years.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KJRF40 >Very Special Liquor Filled Chocolates 48 Count Christmas Holiday Gift Box Chocolate Gift Pack</a>"""
1;This is a very unique gift for anyone.  Chocolate is very good and the presentation is great.  Great to take to a Xmas Party to give the host.  Eveyone will be fighting to get to try a few.  And with 48 in the box it will go pretty far.  It is not strong but you get great flavor of the liquor filling.
1;purchased them for as a special gift for a boat christening.  They REALLY enjoyed and appreciated receiving this unusual gift.  Received the item in good shape and quickly.  very pleased with everything. Will order from them again...
1;Gave this as a gift to my Dad and my boyfriends Dad for Christmas this year. They look great and i got to taste a few myself and i loved them they were so tasty and the alcohol was very real tasting. It was a good buy.
1;I sent this to my sister as a gift for the holidays and New Years Eve and the review from her was that she and all the guests at her house loved these before and after dinner liquor filled chocolates...... Nice gift to be shared with many people.
1;The liquor filled chocolates arrived in perfect condition and were securely but attractively packaged. i am unable to comment on the flavor as they were purchased for a gift. The secure packaging prevented me from sampling the various flavors.
1;Ale 8 is the best thing about Kentucky! It far exceeds any other Ginger Ale product on the market - both because of the delicious taste and because unlike most other Ginger Ale drinks it includes caffeine for that extra shot of energy.
1;"""Vanilla beans in our area cost $6 for one and up to $11 for two.  I like to make my own vanilla extract and I also like vanilla flavored sugar which requires whole beans.  I probably have a lifetime supply of vanilla beans now"
1;"""I have a small gourmet catering business and have a couple of dessert items I use vanilla beans for.  One recipe calls for 3 full vanilla beans for each recipe!  One can image how expensive that would be at $4 - $6 per bean!  This Melissa's box was an incredible buy at just over $1 per bean...the beans are supple and their flavor is very good.  As another reviewer mentioned"
1;I make chia gel with this and add a large spoonful to my yogurt and fruit in the morning.  I tried to make cookies with the gel and that was a failure!  Great for subbing in sauces to add bulk without fat.  Easy to sprinkle on top of any food product too since they have virtually no taste.  Very versatile and easy to eat.
1;I just started eating these recently after hearing about all of their positive qualities and the Omega 3 bit.  I was expecting to take a spoonful and swallow it like medication.  Instead I decided to mix it into my strawberry kefir.  I LOVE the way the little seeds swell up and give the kefir a little bit of a chewy texture.  it reminds me of those Asian drink places that add the Tapioca or lychee pieces to fruit smoothies.  They are great.  Be aware though after you eat these that they are little black seeds and they seem to love to stick between your teeth.  I look like some kind of nasty old redneck with chewing tobacco all over my mouth if I don't floss after eating them.<br /><br />This bag is a nice size and I think it will last a while.  Worth the price.
1;"""I couldn't wait to get my package of these little seeds because of the health benefit they provide and plus I am trying to lose some weight. I've only tried them once but they made a lovely pudding.<br />1/2 cup coconut milk<br />2 tsbp chia seeds<br />1 tablespoon of cocoa powder (i used amazing grass chocolate powder 'cause it's all I had)<br />1 tablespoon cinnamon<br />1 tablespoon honey<br /><br />mix well in a container or small bowl"
1;"""I started adding chia seeds to my diet about 18 months ago.  I have tried various brands and like the Navitas Naturals brand the best of the 4 or 5 brands I have tried.  Not sure if the  organic  promises they provide are absolutely true"
1;"""There are so many miracle health products out there it's hard to know what's for real.  But enough people have said good things about these seeds that I decided to jump on the chia seed bandwagon and order up a bag.<br /><br />***Health Benefits***<br />- extremely high concentration of omega-3 acids (more than salmon)<br />- complete protein!  What does that mean?  I had to look it up too. :)  It means chia seeds contain all the essential amino acids your body needs.  So you could just eat nothing but chia seeds and survive.  Most veggies don't have that"
1;Read one of the chia books out there. This really is a super food.<br /><br />The only down side is the price gouging here on Amazon. Chia can now be found in many grocery stores in the bulk bins for around $9.50/lb. $20/bag here is ridiculous.
1;"""I add chia seeds to my morning shake for breakfast and I am in love with them. They taste great almost like tiny bobas but better. This particular bag last a long time considering I consume them daily.  They are also cheaper than most stores"
1;People that research this product knows that is good to lower your cholesterol and is a great food for busy people that can have just juice for breakfast. The seller was extra nice and took care of me cause my package got lost in the mail and now I finally got it :)<br />Thanks guys!!!
1;Navitas Naturals Chia seed have become a favorite. It was easy to set up the next delivery date to enjoy these healthy seeds. I am sad Amazon has removed them from the auto-ship program. I will continue to buy them for as long as they are available for their health benefits.
1;"""I just found about chia seeds and I actually bought this bag so I could plant them. The seeds are growing like weeds and I've discovered that they are great in my foods also! My husband put them in a tomato sauce to thicken it"
1;"""These are great in juice mix.  What I usually do is mix a tablespoon or two in a glass with half-way filled water.  Stir continuously for the next minute or two (this is to keep the seed separated so they don't stick together in small chunks"
1;"""Where to start on this one. These little seeds had been on my wishlist for at least three months before i actually bought them. I am a vegan and take my nutrition very seriously. All the hype about what a 'superfood' chia seeds were i figured this was just the next new thing. I did some research"
1;"""This is a good product and very high-quality. The majority of people who post on Amazon (and the internet) are not medical providers and are not the least bit inclined in the area of sciences or infant nutrition. There's a large amount of misinformation out there and the misinformation is evident and propagated throughout the reviews for this formula. As for this product specifically (Similac Organic)"
1;"""I was NEVER going to give my children formula... after my first child was born I did not produce enough milk and had to supplement.  We tried all different types of formula from many name brands.  Unfortunately he had adverse reactions to everything we tried"
1;"""I wanted to solely breastfeed but was unable to keep up and had to supplement formula.  I chose Similac because they are a very reputable company and I had a ton of it from the hospital.  We have used both the powder and ready made and he likes both.  He got a little constipated at the beginning but has been on it now for 5 months and no problems.  I read some other reviews about sucrose...well"
1;My daughter played this game at school and just loved it. She wanted to have it at home to be able to play with her friends and family. Its a really fun game until you have to eat one of the terrible tasting jellybeans !!!
1;I use this coffee with my toddy cold press system and it makes a very smooth cup of coffee. I so far have only used Folgers coffee with the system and see no reason to change as the end result is so very good.
1;We have two large dogs whose urine yellows our lawn.  We give them the recommended dosage with their dinner and it has significantly stopped the yellowing of the grass.  Good call.<br /><br />Bottom line- buy it.
1;We love Miso Cup soup!  We use it to flavor our ramen. It is much healthier and tastier than the usual salt and MSG! The price on Amazon is great too! Less than half the price we were paying in a local health food store.  Thanks Amazon!
1;I loved this item.  I wish I could find it in the stores.  Walmart carried this item in Louisiana for some time. When I travel to Louisiana I sometime can find this item at Fred's.  I have not found this item in the Houston area.  Easy to prepare and a great conversation piece.  No one here has seen this before.  I purchased this item at Amazon.
1;"""I live in the Kansas City Area and could not find them anywhere.  I had bought them before at the Commissory in Leavenworth but couldn't find them here.  Someone recommended checking Amazon.com and I was thrilled to find them there.  They are easy to fix and if you like pork rinds"
1;These are magical. Put them in the microwave and they literally pop into a fresh hot crackly bag of pork rinds. They're a little on the salty side but no more so than most of the pork rinds you buy in the store. Each bag fills up a large cereal bowl. Good for a little snack when you need it and you don't want popcorn.
1;I finally tried these noodles and cooked them in chicken broth and added to my stir fry.  Everyone liked them and commented that it was like eating ramen noodles.  Once I got past the fishy smell rinsing them I was happy with the result.
1;I like spicy snacks and this product fills the bill nicely. I will not buy another bag from the store after tasting these. A minute twenty seconds in the microwave and they are done. When my stash gets low I'll be buying more.
1;These taste great and if you don't cook them all the way the tiny bits of pork rinds stay crunchy and hard (Which I love!)<br />It's very reminiscent of porchetta skin.<br /><br />I keep a case of these at work and one at home. That way I have a quick snack at the office and a nice substitute for popcorn at home. Honestly these taste better than any popcorn I've ever had. If you are on a ketogenic diet these are a must have.
1;For anyone who likes pork rinds and a decent spicy flavor these are the way to go!<br />Super easy to cook in the microwave and less cost than buying regular ones.<br />Great taste! Easy and not bad on carbs and fat as well!
1;"""These microwave pork rinds are absolutely the BEST available. Any bag of pork rinds you buy in a store are not as good. The only place I've seen their equal is the ones that are cooked fresh at fall festivals and such places. They are EXCELLENT. Do not overcook them or they will burn and be lousy. If done properly"
1;I bought several brands of microwave pork rinds and Lowrey's is the best.<br />They're very quick to heat (pending microwave) and the rinds actually<br />take shape. Available in original and hot & spicy.  Good deal through<br />Amazon.com
1;My husband & I discovered this item while shopping a while back and fell in love with them.  they are so fresh when you take them out of the microwave.  We like the spices on them.  You just have to remember to take them out of the microwave as soon as the bag rises.
1;I bought these years ago at Walmart<br />and then they stopped carrying them.  I was searching the internet and found them at Amazon.  We ordered a box of each.  I like the spicy and my husband likes the orginal.  A learning process will be a sure thing until you figure out how many minutes for your microwave.  They are great and we love them.
1;I have tried every kind of pork rinds on the market and Lowrey's microwave pork rinds are the best I've ever had.  I've given friends some to try and they totally agree with me.  The only problem is that they are hard to find.  That's why I ordered a case from Amazon.
1;This is a snack that is great any time of the day!  Just enough to share with a friend!  It is an unusual snack that I cannot find anywhere else except amazon.com.<br />I am so happy that it is available!
1;"""1 and 1/2 minutes and the smell will make you run for a cold drink.  Open the bag and you are in bacon rind nervona.  Albite a bit salty...just cut down on something else because these things are excellent as is... If you rated these less than 4 stars you didn't follow the directions"
1;"""Microwave pork rinds?  Figured it was just a bag of the guilty pleasures heated up to add taste appeal.  So I popped a bag into the microwave and surprise!  The bag popped back!  It even puffed up like Orville Reddenbacher's best.  All that in less than 90 seconds.<br /><br />Turns out the little treats are bagged raw and freeze-dried and they actually cook and puff up in the microwave.  The difference between these guys and an off the shelf bag is the difference between bagged and freshly popped pop corn.  And since they're cooked without frying or oil they are -- dare we say -- healthy?  Well"
1;"""I saw this product demonstrated on The Food Channel and knew I had to order it as I LOVE pork rinds but the bagged ones are usually old and sort of stale or processed tasting.  Follow CAREFULLY the directions with these for a spicy"
1;I am a big fan of eating microwave popcorn.  A friend of mine suggested pork rines I thought she was crazy.  Little did I know that they are best microwave snack that I have ever eatin in a long time . Now i can chose between microwave popcorn and pork rinds.
1;These are soooo good but make sure you shake the bag and evenly spread the pieces out within the bag and micro for about 70-90 seconds depending on  your microwave. Always keep an eye on the bag once it blows up to its full area DON'T let it go for any longer than 20 seconds or they will burn and with the hot and spicy your kitchen and your eyes will feel like you have been pepper sprayed. Little more difficult to cook but its worth it. Enjoy
1;You have pork rinds auto shipped to your house - but I dont care - having these low carb snacks readily available is great - and doesnt impact my insulin usage. These are not your fathers pork rinds - awesome hot out of the sack
1;Found this item in the grocery store a few years back and then it seemed to just disappear...found it here and sooooooo happy that I did!  Everyone that tried it loves it too!  Good thing it comes in the big pack!!!!
1;Many years ago I purchased Lawry's microwave pork rinds at Walmart and Publix.  And then they were gone - from both stores.  And then I got the brilliant idea to try Amazon.com!  I've actually ordered 7 cases for myself and my sons.  We're thrilled.  You'll never want any other pork rinds after you've tasted these!
1;"""These microwave pork rinds are quite tasty for them to be cooked in the microwave!  My husband and I love the hot & spicy flavor better than the plain because it has more flavor.  The only drawback I see to these is that if you have an older microwave or one that is not as powerful (at least 1100 watts)"
1;"""These are great snacks.  Being able to cook them fresh really makes them taste better than the average pre-cooked store bought ones.  Great alternative to popcorn.  I ordered both the Hot & Spicy and the Original.  I prefer the Hot & Spicy"
1;These are the best I've had! The flavor is amazing and they crisp right up in no time. I've tried other brands before and they just don't cut it. I will be buying a lot more of these. I wish walmart still carried them.
1;"""If you like pork rinds... You'll LOVE these!  I got them while doing  thrive  and they were so good. I've introduced them to several others and now there is about 7 of my co-workers that love them too! Try them you WILL love them!"""
1;"""we used to buy these at an area store and then suddenly they didn't carry them anymore.  THIS is the way to eat pork rinds...just the right amount and way better than a bag from the grocery store.  and even with the shipping and handling"
1;I first purchased this product a few months ago after a co-worker mentioned them.  So I decided to try them out for myself. To my surprise they are very delicious.  I'm sold! and will continue to buy them. If you like hot fresh pork rinds and spicy ones.  This product is for you. Sincerely Summer
1;Great taste no carbs (I am diabetic) and low cal also. Only drawback may be sodium content. When you need a cracker for a dip I use them. I just make the dip from fat free sour cream and onion soup mix. The dip has more cal than the pork rinds. I n short they are a cracker substitute for me.<br /><br />Most complaints are  improper  cooking  results. Hate to say this but it is your microwave not the product. There are microwave ovens that have a real bad hot spot and this burns them. I had an oven like this (older model)and the problem went away with  the new  microwave.<br /><br />But the biggest thing in their favor is the taste. Love both kinds.
1;We love these pork rinds.  So easy to make and low fat too.  The seasoning has just enough heat to give a kick but not overwhelm you.  We used to buy them occasionally from a local store but haven't seen them in ages.  Thanks Amazon for carrying them.
1;"""SO excited about this food find that i've already e-mailed 100+ friends and family about it!<br /><br />in the past i would buy a bag of chicharron when i craved a taste - and eat at most 1/4 of it .. then when i needed a bit to top a savory filipino dish (pancit palabok or monggo)"
1;Wow. It's amazing how so simple a snack can be so tasty. I wanted something crunchy that wasn't a carb. You might want to eat only bland veggies the rest of the day because it is high in fat and sodium. But a great guilty pleasure nonetheless.
1;This product is fantastic.  Instead of popcorn we eat pork rinds.  They have no carbs which have helped us to keep our weight down.  We feel we have made a better choice.  We eat them practically every night.  Thanks for a great product.
1;"""The more powerful your microwave the better they turn out. 90 seconds in ours and they are large (up to 3 inches) and fluffy mixed with a few crunchies. Our microwave at work is lame. They burn or don't pop completely.  I think I'm hooked!  I subscribe to them-I always like having them around for when  I want something but I don't know what . Oh"
1;3.5 Carbs and 210 calories in an entire bag.<br />Have a slightly different texture than regular rinds but still great.<br />If your watching sodium these may be a little high for you. over 1000mg sodium in the bag.
1;"""I'm currently deployed and I'm on a low carb and high protein diet.  But my current location doesn't allow me to go out into town easily to get the type of foods that would keep me on my diet. So i ordered this from amazon.<br /><br />Pros<br />fast shipping!<br />taste great<br />Zero carbs<br /><br />cons<br />does make the room smell once you open the package<br />so be mindful of anybody else who might complain. just open it outside"
1;I've been eating these (regular and spicy) for several years.  They are definitely superior to the non-microwave kind.  Shake the bag as directed to make sure they are not stacked on each other and I put them on the popcorn setting in my microwave.  Soooo good.
1;"""I love these things.  I used to be able to get them at Wal Mart and a couple local grocery stores.  Now I have a hard time finding them--but they are available through Amazon.  I like all kinds of Pork Rinds--but most of the ones you buy in the store--already made--have a high fat content.  People on a low carb diet can eat any kind--but if you are watching your fat intake"
1;I take various snacks into work and get repaid by the honor system.  I thought I'd try these because they are something different from the usual chips & cookies.  They were a huge hit.  Ten packages were gone the first day and everybody was walking around with a smile on their face spreading the word. I will definitely be ordering more!
1;"""i can no longer find these in our local stores.my whole family loves these.my kids love to hear them  pop .the taste is very good.we prefer these over popcorn.very happy to find these.I will buy more!!"""
1;MY wife is definitely not a chocohalic and is not fond of most sweets. In fact Werther's is the only candy she really likes. So instead of chocolates or flowers I bought this monster box of Werther's for Valentines day. It was a big hit.
1;These pretzels are so good.  I used to buy them in my local grocery store but they discontinued carrying them.  Amazon came through and I thank them dearly.  These pretzels have the best flavor and crunch!
1;I ordered this bouquet for valentine's day and was happy to see how great this arrangement looks once it blooms.  you should expect all the flowers to arrive unopened and they mostly bloomed in 2-3 days.  I received 14 stargazer lilies and 19 irises.  the glass vase was simple but functional and attractive.  2 packets of plant nutrients were included and i expect the flowers will last at least a week (5 days so far).  all i did was cut the flowers under running water and plop them in the vase with 1 packet of food.  you could arrange them yourself for slightly better results.
1;"""I pre-ordered this product from ProFlowers through Amazon two weeks ahead of Mother's Day and was quite happy when it showed up today on the scheduled date. It was delivered by FedEx. The flowers were slightly wilted from being out of water for the 12-24 hours they were in transit but they perked right up after being put in water.  Included in this package was a nice vase and 2 packets of plant food.<br /><br />Keep in mind these are mostly buds and will take a day or two to fully open so you might want to have them delivered slightly in advance like I did.<br /><br />The only possible negative I can think of is the fact I was not provided a tracking number by email to track the package"
1;This is by far the yummiest maple syrup we have ever tried...and we have tried many! I'm having trouble keeping my husband from over-dosing on the stuff! You can order without worry and be assured of a great product.
1;"""Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup is excellent!  There isn't anything on the label that states that this is from anywhere else but Vermont...(some syrups that claim to be pure maple syrup also have labels that state that they may be a product of Canada or Vermont).  The price per oz. is about 81 cents and as I use at least one ounce on my waffles"
1;"""Living on Guam can at times leave much to be desired. We were sitting here talking about when we visited our family in Wisconsin and had some home made ice cream at an Amish farm. I remembered how good it tasted and I remembered I had some Maple syrup ice cream while there"
1;"""Best maple syrup I have had.  Im not a pro and bought some at cosco and threw out what was remaining when this arrived.  I literally have been putting it into a tablespoon and eating it.  This product is  out of this world.   I hope the producers dont change a thing."""
1;This maple syrup is delicious and so flavorful -- Did you know grade B maple syrup has so many vitamins and minerals you could almost not feel guilty about having french toast for breakfast. I also try and use maple syrup where I can for sweetener instead of sugar. The company was wonderful about the shipping and the product arrived packaged well and on time! Enjoy.
1;My husband and I are quite fussy about our maple syrup and we usually buy ours from Canada.  We ran out and decided to try this one and what a surprise it was.  The Grade A Medium Amber from Hidden Springs Maple Vermont is simply fabulous.  Great and fast service.
1;"""I have been drinking this tea for about 2 months now. I have noticed a drastic change in my skin. I normally have really bad skin. I started to drink this for a different reason and then noticed my skin cleared up in the process. I will always drink this now"
1;"""I have begun to use this tea after doing three natural gallbladder/liver cleanses and watching the stones come out like crazy when the doctors could not figure out why I had so much pain.  The cleanses have helped"
1;"""This is such a good deal for this tea! You get six boxes for less then twenty dollars! Well worth it because I love the mild taste and stomach soothing tendencies it has. It's a great regular detox for the liver"
1;"""I have been using this for awhile now. Unfortunately the local stores where I used to buy this stopped carring it and I was able to find this deal on Amazon. I love this tea. I think it tastes great (I do prefer to drink herbal tea without much additions maybe a little organic cane sugar here and there or some almond milk or rice milk).<br /><br />When I was drinking one of these tea bags every day I felt great as I noticed a feeling of  well being  it was like many different body systems were working as they should be. I have been diagnosed with the genetic form of fatty liver and I have a lot of allergies. This tea really helps me. I take this tea in addition to the Himalaya Herbal Healthcare LiverCare for LIver Support (aka Liv.52). I take the LiverCare once daily by mouth. Between one of these tea bags daily and one pill by mouth of the LiverCare...I feel great."""
1;Bought a six pack of these and like using it from time to time...it's a natural way to detox...please be advised start off easy with one cup then work up to two cups a day. I usually do this for about 10 days...then go about 2 or 3 months without this tea and then repeat. All natural.
1;"""I've been having trouble w/my skin lately and thought this tea might help. I steeped one tea bag for a few minutes just to wet the leaves and then tore it open. I combined the wet tea leaves w/one teaspoon plain organic yogurt and spread the mix on my face. I soaked a washcloth in the hot tea water and when it was cool enough"
1;I've used this tea for years off and on. It taste great for a detox type tea and I like to use it when I'm on a fast for a few days to help clean my body out. It's one of the few things I allow myself to drink while fasting.
1;This rub is great stuff.  I have had several dishes that will absolutely become part of my weekly diet.  This rub completely enhances any type of potato sprinkle it on sweet potato fries or cubed new potatoes.  It adds tremendous flavor to chicken and ribs great for a variety of things.  MKS
1;This makes frying chicken easy.  I've used this product for over 20 years but it's not always available locally.  I was glad to find it on Amazon.  It is also good for making ranch fries.  Just dip the potato wedges in water and coat with this and fry.  Perfect every time.  So is the chicken I make with it.
1;"""I recieved the delivery quicker than I thought I would. I was concerned with how the food item would be packaged. The Gyro slices were still frozen when I recieved them. The gyro slices were delicious"
1;"""<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LRIJC8 >Gyro Meat (LOAF) approx. 5lb</a><br />Finally i can enjoy Gyros at home without going out.With gasoline pushing five dollars a gallon it is nice to know that this gourmet food is just a few feet away in the ice box.<br />Now how about Greek olives and Feta cheese so we can have a nice Greek salad with our Gyro."""
1;"""Excellent Product!  Great taste!  Perfect portion!<br /><br />Only 100 calories in a bag.  I microwave it for 1:30 and it comes out perfect each time.<br /><br />Fills a medium tupperware bowl.<br /><br />And it was an very good value!  Only $8.98 for 3 boxes"
1;My husband and I love this!  I usually caramelize Walla Walla sweet onions to mix in the cooked product.  We have also added sauteed zucchini and chopped fresh tomatoes.  I do not feel deprived being on a gluten-free diet when I can indulge in this.  (And no it is not mac and cheese - and I don't believe it is meant to be!)
1;My 10 year old daughter has alot of food allergies.  Two of them are gluten and milk.  This is as close to Mac and cheese that we have found.  We both thought it was very good.  We added tuna to it.  We will definitly be buying more.  Keep adding new products to your line.
1;Even though it doesn't taste exactly like regular mac-n-cheese it is a very tasty product.  My child who has many food allergies was extremely excited to be able to eat mac-n-cheese again.  It is very delicious.  We've made it many times.  It packs well in a thermos for lunch.
1;"""I'm about 6 months in to my transition to becomming vegan.  Every once in a while I think of something that I  miss .  All week I was craving Mac and Cheese but since I stopped eating the meat and dairy"
1;If you are looking for a good pasta alternative this one is great! If you are looking for a Mac & Cheese replacement keep looking. We are celiacs who have caesin intollerance so our taste have changed over the years. This is a very healthy yummy alternative for those living a minimally processed lifestyle. It does not have a cheese taste. We ate it mixed with broccoli. My 2 year old and his little buddy had 5 (child sized) helpings! They have not had much grain recently and demolished everything on their plates. I added the little bit leftover to my evening salad for a different texture. Was still very tasty.
1;"""I bought this because I am vegan and not because the product is gluten-free. The only other vegan Mac n' cheese substitute I have found/ tried are the Roads End products. My husband is hard to please when it comes to vegan cheese"
1;"""I first tried this tea when it came in a Numi sampler set that my daughter brought me for Christmas. I tried it and fell in love with it. Only problem is that no store in the area carried that tea so I ended up buying it online at Amazon and the price was fair"
1;"""I had been looking for an affordable priced quinoa since it is pretty expensive in my store. I noticed Amamzon.com had a sale on quinoa and took a chance on buying it since we had never tried it before. The NOW brand of quinoa is organic which is a HUGE plus. The grains are pretty clean already but I still rinse before using. The qunioa is great"
1;"""I will start off by saying I have yet to purchase this on amazon but I have purchased this at health food stores. So I can not say how it will arrive to you but i cant tell you about the taste.<br />  Amy's organic has consistently done a great job of creating delicious vegan/vegetarian organic food. This soup has a very similar taste to certain canned pasta product. It totally brought me back to my childhood. It is extremely delicious"
1;"""This is my 7 year old son's absolute favorite soup that he takes to school almost every day.  Despite my attempts to broaden his taste buds he continues to insist that he wants this  red  soup every day with crackers.  My husband and I have also tried it and it is quite delicious.  Like all Amy's products you can feel good about giving your child this soup.  The ingredients are all organic and tasty.  I have offered my son Campbell's soups in a pinch when I have run out of the Amy's Alphabet soup but he really doesn't care for them.  If you read the label on Campbell's soup you will realize that they are loaded with junk.<br /><br />Amy's soups cost a bit more than traditional canned soup but I think the extra cost is justified in higher quality ingredients and delicious taste."""
1;"""If you have recently been on a lower carb eating plan such as The New York Body Plan <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FL5FD4 >The Ultimate New York Body Plan: Just 2 weeks to a total transformation</a>and found you really feel better eating less starches than you had in the past"
1;This is 72 for the price of like 24 at the grocery store. If only this were eligible for subscribe and save then it would be perfect. I would not be surprised if the price were to double soon. But I must say these are really good and at a good price.
1;These were the first hemp seeds I've ever ordered. I got them to add to my kale shakes. So far I've been through four  bags and not found one shell. The taste is like that of an unsalted sunflower seed. These include all 21 essential amino acids and are one of many super foods I've added to my afternoon shake. Amazing product.
1;I'm completely satisfied with this purchase of individual packs of almond nuts.  Have ate about 5 bags by now and everyone is delicious with no bad nuts.  Can't think of anything bad with the whole deal.  The bag sizes are perfect for an in between meal snack and are are really healthy for you.
1;All I can say is that our two dogs love these things almost more than anything else. They each get one a day and very much look forward to that special time. These long lasting treats are well worth the money for us.
1;"""I love this gravy mix - much easier and less fat than making from scratch and not as salty as McCormick's or other brands.<br /><br />I use non-fat milk instead of water to make a cream gravy.  This is good stuff.  And by time you order this set of 24 and other items"
1;"""It is indeed a  rich and creamy chocolaty delight  if you use the smallest cup size on your machine.  Remember to shake the box well before using.  Some cocoa still remains in the K-cup after brewing"
1;Very tasty.  You do need to remove the top and scrape out the remaining cocoa to really get all of the flavor.  This is what we have had to do with every brand of cocoa we have bought.  The flavor is excellent.
1;"""My 12 year old loves to make a cup of this before school every morning. The cocoa tastes wonderful and brews up nice. We add a splash of milk to cool it off and it's so good. I don't taste anything artificial"
1;I have been looking for these great candies for years.  Every now and then I would come across them in a candy store.  It is so nice to know I can now order them on line at Amazon and always have Honees on hand to enjoy and share with others.  I love the honey filling. Try them. JANE
1;"""I had not seen these candies in my neighborhood for a long time.  I developed a cough and nothing was working.  I tried to find these because I just had a feeling they would work.  I could not find them anywhere"
1;I first found these at a local deli but they freqently were out of stock so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon. These are very satisfying and I have great fun introducing friends and co-workers to them.<br /><br />I also frequently recommend them to people with sore throats or coughs. Honey is an antibacterial agent and very soothing so these make an excellent lozenge in addition to being a wonderful candy.<br /><br />I bought a case so I can hand them out to people having a bad day. :)
1;Every day is Thanksgiving at Sophie and Sam's dinner mat when they receive their Whiskas Turkey and Giblets in gravy.  They are quick to devour it and clean each other right after eating (I know they hope to pick up a piece hidden in the fur!).  I only buy from Amazon because of their awesome prices!
1;My cat will eat NOTHING but Whiskas Beef in Gravy cat food. Being able to order and receive it through the mail has been a blessing. I get it for my mom because she cannot drive to the store because of her health issues. Its great not to have the extra burden of getting cat food. Her cat is her companion through hard times.
1;My husband has used this seasoning for years.  We bought it through Sam's then could never find it again. I thought why not look on Amazon and as usual there it was. I love this site!  The bottles are large and well worth the money. It's just the best seasoning!
1;"""I'm writing this review on behalf of my husband who is the actual Starbucks VIA decaf Italian Roast coffee drinker. Because of some health concerns he has been drinking only decaf coffee for well over a year. He recently had problems after having a couple cups of what was supposed to be decaf at a restaurant. We believe regular coffee was brewed in what was supposed to be the decaf pot. At a recent visit to our  local  Starbucks"
1;I would rate Starbucks ready brew coffee quite high.  They are very easy to use and I like the flavor a lot.  I use them at work where I only want one cup of coffee and hate to have to use and wash my whole coffee pot.
1;I am a major coffee drinker. I love this coffee. It is my favorite instant coffee. You can't even tell it's instant. I recommend this to anyone who likes coffee and would enjoy the conveinence of having it ready in an instant!
1;"""I love Starbucks VIA!!  Nice to have around when you don't want to make a pot of coffee and you don't want to spend $100+ to get a K-cup machine.  There is a slight amount of grit to the coffee from the micro-ground beans mixed in with the instant crystals"
1;I recommend using half water and half skim milk. I usually mix 5 oz water with 5 oz skim milk and heat in the micro for two minutes.  Add the packet and sugar or sweetener.  Great for a quick cup of coffee without the hassle of cleaning the machine.
1;I was a huge skeptic when this first came out but no longer.  I can't get over how good this instant coffee tastes.  It's better than what I can grind and brew myself.  I have these on my desk at work now for making decaf ice coffee in the afternoons.  It costs 1/4 of what they'd charge me at the store and I can get decaf.  Awesome.  I am truly shocked how good this coffee is.<br /><br />I just wish they sold it in large containers for making full pots.
1;I like to use honey a lot but sometimes it is difficult to use liquid gooey honey.  Honey doesn't produce the negative effects in my system that sugar does.  I use this granulated honey in many foods that need sweetened
1;"""Although I'm a little embarrassed touting something so processed (maybe it's a reaction to a childhood eating peanut butter my parents hand-ground at their local health food store) I have to say I really like this stuff.  It is also the only peanut butter my 10 year old daughter will eat (can't get any other brands past her).  The reduced fat aspect of it may not save calories but it gives the product a slightly sweet taste"
1;This peanut butter is the best and only peanut butter I will eat. I refuse any other kind. I particularly enjoy the skippy reduced fat because A) it is a tad healthier and B) it has a sweeter taste to it. My local grocery store no longer carries it so I was ecstatic to see it available on Amazon and in bulk! =D
1;I have always been a fan of Skippy peanut butter and I love that Amazon is offering buying in bulk at a great price! It is cheaper here than what I find in the store. I highly recommend it as long as you have a place you can store the extra cans.
1;Almost every morning I reach for the Organic Hot Oatmeal Hemp Plus.  It has more body than the typical grocery store instant oatmeal.  It is rich in whole grains and full of fiber.  It is not too sweet
1;I ordered these nuts off a whim because of the flavor. I just got into eating more nuts because I don't get enough Omega 3's. Everybody that I shared these with loved them! I went through 2 containers in a week (because of sharing). This will be a staple in my house from now on!!!
1;I discovered these nuts by accident. They were on clearance ay my local CVS for $1. I wish I had bought them all!<br />The cinnamon and brown sugar flavor is perfect together with the roasted almond flavor. It is not candy coated like other cinnamon almonds (making it a much healthier treat). Everyone that I have shared them with think that they are<br />phenomenal! I highly recommend this product. It is one of the most tasty and healthy snacks you can find. I only wish Amazon would put them on their subscribe and save program.
1;I got these at my local Publix. They're the best tasting almonds of the bunch. The butter toffee tastes natural and the almonds are of good quality. They also make dark chocolate covered almonds. They taste like Cocoa Puffs but are still pretty good if you're looking for a cocoa kick instead.
1;"""Diamond Almonds<br />Almonds are a good source of magnesium. One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people.

1;"""I LOVE the Blue Diamond Butter Toffee and The Chocolate.  This is my first try with the Cinnamon and they are fabulous!  I eat and live low carb and eat a lot of nuts...the flavored Blue Diamond Almonds are hard to find"
1;The Almonds are very very fresh tasting.  The cinnamon adds an extra bonus of goodness to the almonds with a great flavor.  We keep them in the fridge.  We also mix them with all the other nuts we have making our own nut mixture.  Excellent snack with protein.<br /><br />Just ordered some more of them.
1;These are our absolute favorite almonds and love that there isn't any fake sugars in them.  I'll take more calories with real sweeteners any day over sucralose in the other brands. And this flavor is DELICIOUS.  YUM!
1;"""These are incredible!  Eating these makes me not want to eat candy.  I love these!  The price isn't that great though.  I think Blue Diamond should save money by packaging them in something cheaper than plastic.  I did notice it on Amazon in a box"
1;It seems impossible that there is a healthy snack that tastes like cinnamon brown sugar but they've managed to do it.  I love these and I always have my cabinet stocked.  This quenches my sweet tooth without gulit.  I highly recommend it.
1;"""This is an excellent product.  I tried a handful that a friend had and I was hooked!  It has good flavor without being too salty.  You can also chop them and add to salads or in green beans.  My kids enjoy them also"
1;I really love my Keurig brewer but after my third purchase of highly priced tea and coffee K-cups I knew I needed a more cost efficient solution. I purchased a My K-cup for the unit which allowed me to use regular canned coffee but what was I going to do about the tea? I tried opening tea bags and using that tea but it was weak and flat. Next I tried using this tea and it worked perfect (but a word of caution...remove the tea leaves from the filter while moist to make removal easier). No more brewing an entire teapot for just a quick morning cup and no waiting for tea bags to brew and it tastes great!!! Not weak and off taste but perfect. My tea consumption has increased to the point that I now use the Amazon auto ship to receive 6 boxes at a time so that I never run out. If you have a Keurig and love tea this product is the perfect solution...you won't be disappointed.
1;"""My Italian grandmother got me hooked on Lipton Loose Tea as a child. Tea is important to me- I never have gotten into coffee.  It has been increasingly more difficult to find Lipton Loose in supermarkets"
1;"""I've used Lipton's Loose Tea for almost 50 years now and will never change to another brand unless Lipton's goes out of business.  The loose tea consistently makes absolutely the best glass of iced tea.  Tea bags (any brand) are no comparison"
1;I grew up drinking Lipton loose leaf tea and didn't even realize there was any other for iced tea until I grew up and left home. It's still the best! I almost panicked when the stores quit carrying it and was so relieved to find it here. I hope Amazon reads these reviews and realizes that we *need* them to keep carrying it! And that Lipton keeps on making it. Everyone likes my iced tea and says so and that's because this is the only tea I use.
1;I love the Loose Tea. The bag tea has a harsh taste compared To the loose tea. If you drink more than 1 cup a day use a CLEAN (never used for Coffee) Coffee pot. Small 4 cup pots only need 1 tea spoon for weaker a little more for stronger tea.
1;"""I was so disappointed to find that the two stores I shop in had stopped carrying the loose Lipton tea.  This is the only tea I use.  There is a difference between it and tea bags and I'm thrilled that I can buy it on line (and as an added bonus"
1;I use a little plastic shot glass to brew 2 liters perfectly at the office. We love it. That's only a few dry grams makes 2 liters of hot tea! Can't find this in my local supermarket. Glad Amazon has it!
1;"""Haven't been able to find loose Lipton's tea in grocery stores for years and was delighted to find it here at Amazon. This is absolutely the best buy in tea I have made in my life. Received a very ample supply quickly at minimum cost and Amazon paid the shipping.<br /><br />The Tea is as good as I remembered it and I am a happy camper again"
1;"""Fewer and fewer stores carry loose-leaf tea and I was so glad to find it on Amazon. Who knew?  I've become an avid fan of Amazon over the last few months.  It's wonderful to have someone ELSE do the  shopping  for me and allows me to find products in one place."""
1;India is weaponizing the ghost pepper (true story) and in my opinion the idea probably stemmed from the pain and submission that this sauce inflicts upon people. Be VERY careful with this stuff. Just one drop causes myself and all the other insane hot sauce fanatics I know to beg for mercy.  It will cause avid tough guy hot sauce lovers to go into retirement.
1;"""I bought this hot sauce as my gift for a white elephant party. I had watched several videos of people tasting it and watched them all writhe in pain and many go to the ground. I knew that this stuff was potent and could potentially be used in nuclear weapons. Someone ended up picking it and brought it out to try. I wanted no part of this. While she was attempting to dole out her punishment some of it got on the kitchen table. I went to wipe it up with a rag and accidentally got a small drop on my finger. I instantly washed if off as I didn't want any of its pain to somehow seep into my skin. 30 minutes later I found out the power that this beast holds. I was talking to some people when all of a sudden it felt like someone had lit my junk on fire. This wasn't a  when you go raw dogg with some shady club chick  type of burning. This was more like pouring napal down my pants type of burning. Apparently water and soap are not enough to get a drop of this stuff off of your skin. I didn't know that I had to wear gloves to go take a leak after being in the presence of this hot suace. Safe to say for the next 20-30 minutes I was in more pain than having to watch the Notebook twice in a row."""
1;"""Title says it all. I took a dollop of this on a cracker. There is an odd mild and nondescript flavor that I doubt would taint anything. Then the burn begins to build. It just continues to build up until ridiculous levels. The mouth is the easy part"
1;"""Let me preface this by saying that I dont even like hot sauce but after marrying a mexican woman and meeting friends who like spicy food I had to try a few things...I first bought some of Dave's insanity sauces"
1;"""I am extremely happy with this product. I used it to add a little fire to my salsa and was not disappointed! Be careful if you get any of the undiluted extract on your skin as it does not easily wash off.  The oils are persistent and if you rub your eyes"
1;I am leasing a 15 year old mare who is extremely stiff (and quite out of shape).  I started her on these 2 weeks ago and have noticed a big improvement with her movement.  I don't know if it is mainly because she is getting into shape or if the Glucosamine is helping.  She loves them so I plan on continuing to give these to her for the remainder of the lease and to my next horse if he/she is in the older category.  It can only be good for them.
1;I got this for my 23 year old gelding.  He loves it and it seems to be helping him.  His appetite and joints appear to be improving. I wish they sold this in 30lb or 50lb sizes.  Then all of our horses could have this everyday.
1;My 4 month old female lab/shep/hound mix loves these.  She likes to fling them around like a cat and they keep her busy for a good ten minutes.  They are also a bit chewier than other treats so she takes her time finishing them and considers them an ultimate reward when she does something good.  They can be hard to find in stores but are readily available on Amazon.
1;Found these at Walmart and instantly loved these cookies. The taste is so good and it's a great example of a healthy choice to make without leaving out anything on the taste. Too bad these bars aren't widely available anymore. Luckily Amazon helps me out every time and delivers some boxes to my doorstep when my personal stock runs out. Wouldn't know what to have without these. It's without a doubt the best flavor in the series!
1;This is the perfect snack for that 10am drop between breakfast and lunch.  It's creamy without being too sweet.  I'm so glad AMAZON offers this bar since all the grocery stores in my area have discontinued them. Give them a try!
1;"""My cat is 12 years old and very finicky about what she eats...she has never eaten dry food..she will starve before touching dry food. But..mostly she just meows as loud as she can and gets into mischief if she doesn't have what she wants to eat.... She loves this type of cat food"
1;"""I purchased these chips for my mobile vending cart. Because I have Amazon Prime the cost per bag is really good as far as a reseller goes. Each flavor is really good in its own right. These chips the Asian Sweet and Spicy are just so tasty. Its just the right amount of sweet and the slightest bit of spice that makes these a fantastic tasting chip.<br /><br />Lets talk about details:<br /><br />Chip thickness (+)<br />These are gourmet chips and the quality is there from the moment you open the bag. Each one is crunchy and not too thick but just enough to let you know you didn't buy a bag of Lays.<br /><br />Grease (+)<br />These are NOT greasy chips. Depending on the flavor they are just mildy seasoned and not coated in a heavy grease or oil.<br /><br />Flavor (+)<br />Each flavor stands completely on its own. You could do a blind taste test of each one of these flavors sold by Deep River and I bet you could tell what it was. None of the flavors are overpowering except maybe the Jalapeno flavor which is honestly too hot and I love hot food.<br /><br />Resale (+)<br />You may not resell these but at the current price and using Prime shipping the cost per bag allows you to make a decent profit.<br /><br />Overall:<br />These are great tasting"
1;"""Addictive and totally unexpected. I first tasted these at the Fancy Food Show in New York a couple of years ago. Was amazed to find them on Amazon - and bought immediately for our lunch clients. What you want in a potato chip: the crunch is fantastic and the flavor gives off both rosemary and olive oil"
1;These are delicious lower sodium/fat chips. Convenient lunch/snack size bag is enough for sharing. Halloween is two months away and the kids will be getting these for trick or treating at our house.  By the case means they're always on hand.
1;My husband was just diagnosed as gluten intolerant and he thought his life was over.  Surprize he loved these chips and couldn't believe it.  I did too and am not allergic to foods.  Can't say enough good things about this chip.
1;I recently bought these chips.  Came home and only three bags were left in the box.  My whole family loves them.  They have great flavor and better and healthier than more chips. I'm ordering a few more boxes today
1;The potato chips are wonderfully tasty.  My sons and I both like the Rosemary and Olive Oil because it is not as spicy.  We also got the Jalapeno.  It is not so much I don't like the Jalapeno.  It is spicy hot for me.  I still love the potato chips.
1;"""This is a re-post of the review I left for the 5 oz bags ... Addictive and totally unexpected. I first tasted these at the Fancy Food Show in New York a couple of years ago. Was amazed to find them on Amazon - and bought immediately for our lunch clients. What you want in a potato chip: the crunch is fantastic and the flavor gives off both rosemary and olive oil"
1;"""You know you have a great salt & vinegar chip when after one individual bag your mouth is all puckered up!<br />Deep River makes a great chip and comes in packages just the right size for one person to enjoy. And"
1;I have purchased this at Costco several times and the quality seemed to be lacking.  This purchase through Amazon was superior.  I'm not certain why there is a quality difference.  I would definitely check this out.
1;"""I have been consuming olives and olive oil for years and years for its nutritional value. I cook with olive oil or use it as dressing or add few spoons into my dish since I need the good unsaturated fat contained in olives in in my diet. All vegetable oils are processed and diluted including LIGHT or EXTRA LIGHT olive oil which is a highly refined oil without the nutritional value. I use much more expensive EXTRA VIRGIN olive oils which taste very fruity and sharp from EU but I have been to their farms and know the product real well and trust the producer as well. Unfortunately"
1;I use this in cooking and also as a skin care product. First time that I have tried olive oil as a moisturizer and I absolutely love it. This is one brand that I will buy again.It is great and gentle on the skin.
1;"""[[ASIN:B007IK5QZO Kirkland Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil] ]<br />I purchased this olive oil based on testing performed by University California Davis back in early 2010.(I've found of no new testing since then) The results rated Kirkland Brand extra virgin olive oil (3 samples provided for testing)"
1;Finally a cookie that taste great!  If you have eaten any gluten free cookies before you know they are bland.  These cookies are AWESOME.  The best part is I dont have to worry about my multiple food allergies.  I would recommend them to anyone who loves cookies like me!
1;I love Dr. Lucy's cookies.  All the flavors are terrific.  I don't eat them because they're gluten free-I have no allergies-but I am a vegetarian who usually eats vegan.  I often crumble these (or the sugar cookie flavor) on top of a bowl of coconut milk ice cream-it's spectacular.
1;"""What a wonderful surprise to find LUCY's on Amazon.com!  I haven't enjoyed a cookie as much as I enjoy LUCY'S since going gluten free several years ago.<br /><br />They have that just-right crunch.<br />They are just sweet enough - not too"
1;My son is on a restricted diet due to allergies and he is very picky. It was hard to find things that he would even try. After tasting one of these cookies he was hooked. Now this is a favorite snack of his.
1;i bought these after having them at starbucks and i loved them. im always looking for a weight watcher friendly snack and these fit the bill. they are four weight watcher plus points and are delicious.
1;"""This is a very flavorful cookie with a nice texture. It is also low in Carb. I have used the crumbs from these cookes to replace a grahmcracker crust and was extreemly pleased with the results. It is my only  must have in stock  cookee!"""
1;to all of you gluten free people out there who thought that you couldn't eat Chocolate Chip cookies anymore- think again!  These are so delicisious taht you won't miss the wheat!  They are the best wheat free cookies I've found.  I could eat half a box at a time but I try not to!  :)
1;"""I have 15 documented food allergies and it is very difficult to find decent goodies.  These are the best allergy friendly cookies I have tasted yet!  I tried them for the first time today.  I needed to use up a Starbucks gift certificate and found these cookies in a basket in the front of the store.  Boy was I pleased when I discovered they were as good as any cookie made with wheat and eggs. Not the bland"
1;"""I am not GF but my 7 year old daughter is and I like to try everything with her.  She almost did not get to eat any of them because they were soooo good!  I'm normally not a crispy cookie kind of girl"
1;"""These were wonderful. I don't know how they make these so crunchy and airy at the same time. I bought a 16 pack box of these and got in the habit of having a bag (only 120 calories for 4 good-sized cookies) of these every afternoon when I got sluggish. I began to look forward to their cinnamony taste and was bummed when I finally finished all of them. I tried to make some like them and it was a sad failure so just a couple of days ago"
1;These cookies are the best.  They are very crispy and taste great with a bowl of coconut milk ice cream.  The reviewer who thought they had an aftertaste or grainy texture is reacting to something I can't taste at all
1;"""As someone who has been at this for a very long time...wheat free that is... I have tried dozens and dozens of gluten free cookies.<br />A cookie-a-holic I have to have my morning coffee with a cookie.<br />Up until this point most of the gluten free cookies have been huge disappointments..<br />I have thrown more practically full boxes of cookies in the trash than I care to remember...they were just not worth the calories"
1;"""I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack. This one is one of my favorite flavors and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods. This flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with just a little dose of salt.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein"
1;These are the best smoked almonds I have ever had. I remember getting these as a child on the airplane as a snack and have been searching for them for years. Finally found them and I will NEVER eat any other smoked almond. Blue diamond almonds are forever!!!
1;"""What's not to like?  Delicious smokehouse almonds in the perfect size package.  I keep them in my locker at the gym for a post workout snack.  They are very smokey-don't leave an open package in your car"
1;The steaks came well sealed and packaged and were delicious. The price was right too for the size and quality of steaks that came.  I would recommend getting this product for the gourmet food lover in your life.
1;"""I used to use another product by another vendor but they were always running out and not replacing their product for quite a while.  I was glad I found this product as it is even better than the one I used to use.  I LOVE IT!!!!  As a Hawaiian"
1;"""These are a tasty alternative to carb-heavy regular pretzels. I rely on Kay's Naturals to help me in my high protein diet. I would have these for breakfast every day if I could. I'm sad that I have to order them online"
1;Bit size pretzel sticks are delicious.  Small packages of these sweet and salty pretzels satisfy my cravings for foods I should not be eating.  They are made of nutricious ingredients that follow my weight reduction diet and can be used as one of my mini meals.  Buying them in quantity for discount pricing is a great bonus!
1;Love the kays naturals line.Gluten free and healthy-totally delicious!the cinnamon sticks are my favorite and the pizza flavored puffs for the savory treat. Amazing that 12 grams of protein fits in this small serving! my best find for healthy snack food.
1;These soy based pretzels are a little sweet and contain protein which makes them perfect for a mid afternoon snack.  They help cure the munchies and hold off the appetite until suppertime.  Love them and keep a constant supply on hand.
1;"""I try to follow a somewhat low carb diet and find that these pretzels fit the bill as far as satisfying my need for a carby crunch.  I really enjoy all of Kay's chips and pretzels but keep in mind that"
1;This is the best truffle oil out there. They infuse good olive oil. Beware of those who use cheap oils instead! I keep buying this. The seller ships quickly and packs well. You can trust this delicious product!
1;"""I admit I'm a coffee snob. It's my one vice. I fell in love with coffee when I went to Venice. I found a little coffee shop on the Grand Canal. I knew that moment with its aromas and sights would be locked into my spirit as a rite of passage in a sense. Unfortunately back in the states I discovered another world. Most of the coffees here tasted like something that was scraped off the pavement at Jiffy Lube. Eventually"
1;We are definately coffee addicts and have tried tons of different coffees out there on the internet over the years. We go through a pound of coffee every 5 days. We have ordered from almost every specialty coffee place out there and alot of them were great ones but was always still looking for that certain taste and this one has it!! I am so happy we decided to try this coffee. We are now monthly subscribers. This is also the first review I have ever posted and I have bought quite a bit from Amazon. This coffee is GREAT!
1;My wife and I switched from Peet's to Weavers about a year ago and we've never looked back. The Organic Blend is our favorite - such great flavor with incredible aroma too. Can't wait until tomorrow morning when I get to brew another pot. Weavers is the best coffee kept secret around - not for long I'm sure.
1;"""I have been drinking this coffee since I learned that it won a national (televised) competition for best tasting coffee in its category (organic).  I can't drink any other coffee now because all the others taste terrible compared to Weavers. Try this...grab a handful of whatever whole been coffee you drink in one hand.  Hold a handful of Weaver's whole been coffee in the other.  Look at the size of the beans.  Now notice the texture and smell of the  beans.  You don't even have to taste them to see that it is a high quality product.<br /><br />I used to order this coffee directly from Weaver's website until I found it here on Amazon.  I was worried that it would not be as fresh as the coffee ordered directly from Weavers but Amazon sells so much of it"
1;"""I bought this based on the other reviews and I have to say this coffee is the best I have ever had without any reservations.  I drink on average six to eight cups of coffee a day and I own a top of the line super automatic espresso machine"
1;Weavers Coffee is what some refer to as the best coffee on earth. Once I had my first sip I was hooked for life. This great coffee has a great taste and is far superior to Pete's coffee. Experiencing the magical taste of Weavers Coffee is unforgettable and will be the best decision you've ever made.
1;I have tried many different coffees and have never experienced tasting such an excellent coffee like Weaver's organic blend whole bean coffee.  It is very full-bodied and sweet.  There is no bitter after taste.  I highly recommend this coffee to anyone who loves a great cup of coffee!
1;This coffee is great!  I ordered it as a Christmas present with a new grinder and he went through a full bag of these beans in just a few short weeks and praised the quality repeatedly.  Will definitely be purchasing again.
1;My girlfriend can rarely have caffeine because of her heart but she can't help but always have a little cup when I make a pot of weavers organic blend. The French roast is worth a try but I must say my absolute favorite is the organic blend! its taste is unchallenged by others.
1;Best treats for anysize dog. No matter how large or small.  We give these to our local humane society as well.  They dont have the option of purchasing such hi quality treats.  our 45 pounder herding dog loves them.  and the small dogs think they are steaks... nearly jump 5ft for a piece.  dry and greasless and break easily.  can put directlly into pocket without concerns of residue transfer. my favorite and the dogs too.
1;"""A friend turned us on to Earth and Vine's Sake Teriyaki marinade and I think we're addicted.  It's great on burgers but I mainly use it on steaks.  Definitely the best teriyaki sauce I've ever used as it provides sweetness without overpowering the natural meat flavors.  (Helps the steak and burgers char up real nice"
1;"""Krusteaz Pumpkin Pie Bars are out of this world!  We first made them for a big party that we hosted and the guests just went nuts over them.  They were all gone before we even got a chance to try them"
1;"""If you have yet to try rooibos tea you are in for a treat. This smooth delicious tea is excellent any time of the day. I like that rooibos is naturally caffeine free so I can drink it late at night and not worry about staying up all night. I used to drink rooibos when I lived in Africa so this brings back fond memories. What I like most about this tea"
1;"""Not sure I'd call this a  meal  on the go.  The can of tuna salad is like the size of a can of fancy feast. And you get 6 ritz sized crackers.  Do get me wrong the tuna salad itself is excellent.  Creamy compared to the pouch style  make your own stuff . The carrots are a nice touch.  Minimal packaging"
1;I love this stuff! I am currently deployed in Afghanistan and working extremely long hours.  I keep these delicious little kits in the office and in my wall locker in my sleeping area.  They have saved me many times when I couldn't leave to get a complete meal in the dining facility. Love them!
1;I have purchased many porcini mushrooms in grocery and gourmet stores. These were the best quality (flavor and shape). The price was excellent as well. I added some to a fresh mushroom soup I made and got an incredible depth of flavor. Have also used them in braised beef dishes.
1;I enjoy the flavor of this very delicious soft peach candy.  It has definitely become one of my all time favorite candies.  The other flavors that this seller makes are also good but the peach flavor ranks #1 in my book.
1;By far the best home taco kit you can get. I  tried all the other ones you can find in local stores and not only is this one better I don't like the other ones.  It is a combination of the mix & shells having a strange taste to them.  Most local grocery stores don't seem to be carrying this anymore so I have them delivered every 3-6 months automatically depending on how often we go through them.  Taco night is one of my 3 year old son's favorite nights as he gets to make his own taco!
1;"""I purchased Bob's Red Mill 12 Grain Pancake/Waffle mix and gosh dernit a small waffle iron. I prefer a stronger maple syrup and this is a great buy from Anderson's. If you don't see any reviews in the next couple of weeks"
1;I've had quite a few different Grade B maple syrups over the years and this brand is my favorite. Rich maple flavor and nice thick texture. Love this syrup on buckwheat waffles and pancakes. Highly Recommended!
1;We converted to Grade B Maple Syrup about a year and half ago.  We have tried several different brands and they have all been good.  This is by far our favorite.  The flavor is excellent and it is always a joy to open the bottle and pour out this delicious treat.  Works great on pancakes/waffles/french toast as well as in cookies/baked goods and sauces (my favorite...part of the glaze I use on smoked ribs...mmmmmmmmmmm).  Amazon has an amazing price on an amazing product.  This is our 3rd bottle of Anderson's Grade B and we will continue to purchase it as along as it is available.
1;"""My wife had some coffee at the Cafe d'Arte coffee shop when visiting her mother last year. She raved about it so much that I contacted their web site to sample some. It was great. Some friends who own a local restaurant (which prides itself on its good coffee) agreed that it was the best they ever had. I reordered several times"
1;I was not able to find potato starch in my local stores. I went to specialty cake decorating stores and was told that this product could be found in the regular super markets....not the case. I came across this cake recipe which called for the potato starch and I wanted to use the ingredients stated. I was so happpy when I found the product in small and large quantities. This is a web site that I will definitely book mark. The end product was a beautiful looking and great tasting cake.
1;That says it all. This is the most wonderful way to get fiber. I use it as a snack as opposed to cookies or chips. I nver use milk just 1 cup in a bowl and a slowly munch one square at a time. It works for my weight watchers plan. A great way to get fiber and soothe the cookie monseter in a healthy fashion.
1;"""This cereal is so tasty - it seems like you are eating one of those not-good-for-you sugary cereals that kids love. They are very similar to Cinnamon Toast Crunch. They do have a slight  healthy  taste"
1;"""Finally a High Fiber cereal that tastes great!! I like mixing the Carmel with either the Honey Cluster or the Raison Cluster for an even Higher Fiber load. And the lowest price I've found these cereals in on Amazon.com (we all love saving money while being healthy"
1;"""Excellent fiber content and yummy caramel flavour at a great price per case.  Parents and kids happy with breakfast this week.  It's a whole grain flavor but we are used to that.  This makes a good home made trail mix ingredient with Raisins"
1;"""As a young guy im concerned with taste and also fiber content. This is high in sugar/carbs but it's entirely justified for the great taste and the high fiber. No other cereal taste this good and is moderately good for you. Other fiber one cereals maybe healthier"
1;"""I've tried many different brands of rose jams and was alway disappointed because they were too sweet with very little flower flavoring. I'm so glad I found the Kafka brand of Rose Preserves because this tastes exactly as it should with subtle aroma of rose (you know you're getting the real thing in the Kafkas brand because you can see some bits of the petals in the jam!). This is great alone on toast"
1;"""I first tried Rose Preserves at an Algerian restaurant and I was hooked. They are absolutely amazing and so delicious. I knew I had to get a jar of my own.<br /><br />This is now a staple in my household. I use Rose Preserves on all sorts of things but crepes are probably my favorite. Rose Preserves go wonderfully with both sweet and savory foods. Try it with goat cheese or Brie"
1;Condiments add such vibrancy and depth to dishes and this mustard can stand alone!.  I had read about this mustard on a food blog written by a former Chez Panisse chef.  I knew I had to try it.  I'm hooked!  It is a sublime addition to vinaigrette but when spread on rye bread with a few slices of ham ......love at first bite!
1;This mustard was given to me by a client. This is truly the best Dijon mustard I have ever had!  I highly recommend it. I put it on literally everything. The other night my husband and I slathered it onto steaks. Delicious!
1;"""This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt"
1;This is the first time I have used land mined salt.  I usually use salt from various sea sources.  After reading several reviews here on Amazon I decided to try this salt.  I was very pleasantly surprised the first time I tasted the salt. The flavor was fresh and subtle.  Not like the salt you usually buy in the grocery stores. Plus it has a lot of trace minerals your body needs.  I highly recommend this salt.
1;I love pink himalayan salt! It is loaded with minerals and taste great.  I don't have to use as much as the conventional table salt and I don't feel bad about using it because I know that it's also really good for my body.
1;"""I have not purchased this from Amazon yet as still on what I purchased elsewhere BUT I noticed many people buying the one pound bag. Just to let you know: one kilo equals 2.2 lbs. Why would you buy the one pound bag on something that never goes bad when you can get more than double for just a few dollars more.<br /><br />Dr. Mercola's comments regarding Himalaya salt benefits are what started me using this initially a few years ago. Many micronutrients"
1;"""I was very pleased with the Himalayan salt. It really does taste much better than ordinary salt and you can actually taste some of the other minerals in it. I would describe it like licking a salty rock"
1;Great salt! Though now that I know how great it is I will have to buy a bigger bag next time. Mixed with some epsom salt and essential oils this makes a great bath salt. Ground up a bit finer it is wonderful for cooking. Will certainly buy again.
1;I use this salt very liberally now especially after finding out that its table salt you really need to avoid.  Our bodies need salt to live and this is the purest kind out there.  I plan to make this salt a part of my regular diet.
1;I discovered this salt about 2 years ago and have not looked back. I love it. The Spice Lab gives you a high quality product for a great price. It is hard to describe Himalayan salt - you get more salty goodness without using so much. It is delicious!
1;Just like in the store for a fraction of the price. I purchased this to refill my expensive pink salt grinder. A million times better than table salt. I don't know if it tastes any different from regular table salt but I think there is something about the shape of the crystals that changes the way the salt hits your tongue. If you have a good grinder I highly recommend checking this stuff out.
1;Not too dry<br />Not too wet<br />Not too hard<br />Not too soft<br /><br />Perfect for when you want to give your dog a treat and are heading out the door.  By the time you open the door and turn around to check on him the treat has been chomped to bit and swallowed  not fear of a choking while you walk out.
1;"""Mix1 is my favorite post-recovery drink after a long run or bike ride.  I especially like the Vanilla mix1.  It goes down easy and smooth and is very refreshing.  It is a great recovery/protein drink with lots of extra vitamins"
1;So much better than other protein products in drugstores or even GNC. Taste great and doesn't fill up like other shakes do so you can work out after quickly. Relatively cheap for all the good things you get with it.
1;"""This is a wonderful English Breakfast tea- nicely flavorful without being either too bold or too bland. Makes a wonderful morning tea without any sort of bitterness or tang-y taste to it. It's a nice comfort tea and a good start to loose teas for anyone who has been using bags and doesn't know which flavor loose teas to start with.<br /><br />I recommend brewing as follows: 2 teaspoons to 12-16 ounces of boiling water for 3.5 minutes. If you overbrew (particularly Adagio's teas)"
1;"""These chocolates are made in small batches in Kohler Wisconsin. We use to drive to Kohler to buy them. It's good to know that you can order them on Amazon. Each piece has an amazing combination of flavors and textures. I particularly enjoy the ones with molasses"
1;I come from a family of professional gardeners and I cannot grow plants to save my life. These seeds however did get started and actually grew a few inches...... however the rabbits in our garden thought the plants very tasty so clearly there is nothing wrong with the product ...it's the gardener!
1;"""These are the same product as the Bite-Size in the smaller blue bag except that they're longer links and vary in length.<br /><br />The ingredient list is somewhat gross as it lists specific parts of the pig.  If you can get past that"
1;Ordered these for my diet. They are high in protein and only 140 calories per stick. They are great for a meal replacement as one stick will fill you up and keep you full for a long time. I have my stick during lunch at 11:30 with a glass of water and I am not hungry until dinner time at 5:30.
1;I've been eating these since the early 80s. They are my favorite brand of all time. It seems they are getting impossible to find even from Oh Boy Oberta. My package arrived today and they are as fresh as the day from the factory...meaning well preserved and soft. I hope I can find more.
1;I've been using this ghee for years now and can say that it's hands down the best.  The quality is unsurpassed.  I've spoken with the owner of the company (a really nice man) who told me his wife hand packs the jars!  This is truly a family business and one that I feel happy supporting.
1;I ordered this after finding out that it's not good to cook with olive oil. This was my first time trying ghee and I really like it. When I ran out I bought another brand of ghee from the story but I definitely like this one better. I just wish they had a bigger size.
1;"""Wonderful flavor full of easily assimilated vitamins and minerals. My son is allergic to dairy except for ghee. He does well with This product because it is both organic and grass fed. I wish I could buy it locally to cut down on packaging"
1;"""Pure Ghee is a staple in our home. Although it may seem to be a luxury to spend on a condiment it will become one of those ingredients one cannot live without. I have tried many 'health food' store commercial brands and I have tried to make my own"
1;"""I stumbled upon this product while looking for Organic Butter made from non UHT milk. This is by far the BEST ghee I have tasted in a long long time. This ghee reminded me of my childhood days. The 'milk man' would bring the cow to our door"
1;"""I ordered this ghee after reading Ramiel Nagel's  Cure Tooth Decay . He claims regular use of high vitamin butter oil from grass fed cows feeding on fast growing summer grass not only adds much needed vitamin A to the diet"
1;I love love love this stuff! The company is very good about quality and the cows are grassfed. I use it for  everything. Is it pricy...yes but worth it! I'm currently out of the country and can get quality butter anywhere but thank God I packed this ghee with me. I'm so thankful for quality products like this.
1;This is an excellent product. The taste is delicious and it is great for sauteing since it has a high smoke point. I also love that it is grass-fed! I will definitely recommend this to my health-conscious friends.
1;I ordered this ghee for my family while we work at improving our dental health and overall health.  It's very tasty and the kids love it on toast.  It also came REALLY fast which was nice.  I will be ordering more.
1;The first time I tried Moonstruck Chocolates I was hooked. These are the very best chocolate truffles !  I ordered the truffle box and it arrived quickly . Everyone should try a Moonstruck chocolate. It is really a treat !
1;Orville's is the best microwave popcorn you can buy...in my opinion.  The price is outstanding from Amazon and we have compared it all around at various stores.  Almost all the kernels pop and we love the movietheatre butter flavor!<br />Cannot go wrong with this purchase.
1;What a great deal. I live in an area where you can almost NEVER get what you want in the size you want...when you want. So when there is a good deal..I get it. Then I discovered Amazon grocery. OMG!! I love it! CASES 'o food at amazing prices!! Anyway...this peanut oil is wonderful. Great size bottle for every day use. Excellent!
1;I can just look at a carb and I gain weight.  This product allows me to eat pasta and not get all the high impact carbs on my blood sugar.  18 grams of fiber is outstanding! Unlike the other reviewer I think it tastes really good.  The texture is a little more chewy and thick but again this is something I like.  I dont miss white pasta at all when I eat this.
1;My cats love this cat food. I am very pleased with all the varities. It is very healthy much more than the artificially colored store brands that made one of my cats throw up when he ate it. Their coats have become very shiney. Very impressice cat food. Highly recommend
1;My daughter's daughter is turning 6 and wanted a bubble gum theme.  Of course MY daughter remembered growing up as well as I with the tiny size Chiclets.  We looked everywhere and found them on Amazon!!  WE were thrilled and purchased several packs to introduce it to the 6 year old's and bring back wonderful memories of Chiclets gum. Still the same wonderful product that is always was.
1;"""I LOVE King Syrup!! As a child I would visit my grandmother in PA and we would have it for breakfast on buttered toast. I always looked forward to my visit because the Midwest didn't have it. It one of those childhood memories that gives you the warm and fuzzies. I would be enjoying breakfast while listening to my grandmother tell a story. When my family would pack up to return to MO"
1;I used to have this syrup at my grandmothers house all the time.  The product is the same as I always remember it.  It is a very thick syrup.  The only complaint I have is that the bottles I used to use it out of were glass and these bottles are plastic.  No big deal though it doesn't change the syrup.
1;I was raised up with King Syrup.  I couldn't find it until last year. My Brother lives inCalifornia and he couldn't find it eaither so I mailed him some for xmas this past Christmas. He loves it as well as my other 4 siblings.  Thank You so very much for abilling me to get some more.
1;"""Little BITZ chicken treats are the best treats I've found for my little dog. Not only are they good for him but he LOVES them. I'm so disappointed that the stores where I live stopped carrying them and thrilled to death that I can order them here. My chihuahua is very fussy because he's very spoiled. These treats are the only ones he'll eat"
1;"""While 12 packages were to be sent out in 1 order ONLY 1 pack was sent out in 1 order BUT after contacting you and explaining the problem your company fixed it right away - AFTER ALL we all make mistakes"
1;This is one of the few products my spoiled brats really appreciate. I look for bargains and sometimes I find cheaper elsewhere. This product is from petfooddirect.com and often they offer coupons through email. My kitties only like the elegant medleys and basically refuse all else and they only like a few of these too. I am stuck spending all my dough to feed the felines. Oh well ...
1;The garden greens added to this product was the reason I bought it because my cat was trying to eat any twigs she found in my yard in addition to the twigs in trees she climbs.  My cat was a stray cat who obviously had not been getting a balanced diet.  I believe the Fancy Feast florentine style is changing her eating habits because she chews fewer twigs and has begun nibbling on any available green plants.
1;"""This is hard to find on grocery shelves.  Thank goodness McCormick is producing it now.  I look forward to using it in several recipes.<br /><br />I bought it for Chocolate Chile Mole Brownies -- which were received with skepticism until tasted.  Then there were rave reviews.  I've downloaded other dessert recipes using ground ancho chile pepper"
1;Exactly as advertised. Plenty of space to set the Keurig brewer on top and still fit under a counter top (depending on counter top height). Cups fir in nicely and the drawer is easy to access and see what K-Cups you may want.
1;I love this drawer. My Keurig Cuisinart Coffeemaker fits on it perfectly. It holds 36 K-cups so I always have many options for hot beverages right where I need them. I think it looks great and the drawer slides in and out very easily. Don't know how they could have made this simple item any better.
1;"""I just got a Keurig for my mom who is 82 and disabled. It is so much easier now for her to get her cup of coffee and tea. I read over many reviews to decide whether to buy the carousel or this storage drawer. I finally decided on this for the space saving design. It was the right choice. It is sturdy"
1;When I first purchased my Keurig coffee maker I couldn't decide how to store the K-cups. I didn't want to give<br />up my counter space for the carousel. I settled for a flat holder that with open compartments and could be<br />put in a drawer or attached to the wall. I didn't want to spend the extra few dollars for this drawer type.<br />After shifting that one around from drawer to balanced against the wall I finally gave in and went for this great holder that allows the Keurig to sit on top and now I have my counter space back and a nice neat area for my<br />Keurig. I hope that I can save someone some time and money by letting you know about my experience.
1;A birthday gift to myself. My hubby gave me the Keurig for Christmas. And I was having a hard time storing all my flavors of the K-Cups. I love this for you pull it out and there they are ....flavors and all. Good construction too. And it all fits under my cabinet with room to open and fill the reservoir.
1;My order arrived quickly and was packaged well and well worth the price. I like it better than the stand up K-cup holder because this goes right under the coffee maker and doesn't take up extra space. The drawer slides in and out smoothly too.
1;"""This drawer is very sturdy (as long as it's on a flat surface) and holds plenty of K cups. It's great because it doesn't use your counter space and even with my heavy CuisinArt K cup coffee maker on top"
1;The product arrived quickly.  It was just perfect and although it says it holds 36 K-cups - it actually holds MORE if you turn every other one upside down!  We have our coffee maker sitting on top and just love the convenience of the coffee right there. THANKS for a great product.
1;I received the Keurig K-Cup shelf and it is a perfect addition to the Keurig coffee maker and allows you to have 40 or so K-cups nearby without having to look at them (like you would have with the K-Cup tree).
1;Good solid product.  Saves room when storing your k cups.  One thing to check is the space under your cabinet.  My Keurig is on my kitchen counter and I had to pull it out from under the cabinet since the tray would not open with the extra height.
1;This storage drawer fits in perfectly on our countertop. We can either set the Keurig on top of it or beside it and still store a large amount of k-cups where people can get at them easily. Totally satisfied!
1;Such a great little item to have in your cake/cookie decorating collection. Adds great accents. Silver is probably my most used color because it can be added to so many colors.<br /><br />Highly recommend you check your local Michaels or Joann's. Amazon usually has competitive prices but these are $3-4 at your local craft store - $8 is WAYY overprice on amazon.com.
1;This product is wonderful! Just apply it with a nice paint brush to almost any creation and watch it sparkle! I have had so many ooo's and ahhh's over my cookies because of the sparkles. I add some to the leaves of my royal frosting flowers and they turn out gorgeous as well. I cannot wait to try the other colors! Even though fondant is sick tasting..it can look stunning! It almost makes me want to eat it..almost.
1;"""Erin Baker Breakfast Cookies are an excellent alternative to energy bars and other trail foods.  They pack well and provide 300 nutritious calories and sustenance.  They are not gourmet desert cookies"
1;"""I ordered these cookies after purchasing some chocolate ones at a local grocer.  The natural ingredient list is what caught my attention. We have enough food products on the market that are over-processed and contain so many artificial things that most people can't even pronounce. I ordered the Morning Glory variety in a trio pack  which also contained the Oatmeal Raisin and the Fruit and Nut varieties.  Since I had tried the chocolate cookie but was not aware of the other choices"
1;The breakfast cookie is excellent. My grandson came back from a scouting trip and said it was better than the energy bars they were given to eat. Nice blend for any time of day. I pop mine from the freezer into the microwave for about 20-30 seconds. Taste  best warm.
1;"""Erin's  cookies  are the awesome - great for an on-the-run family when there's no time for a longer breakfast.  I keep them on hand at all times for my kids so they can grab one when they go out the door to school or work......I even keep two in my car console for those moments when I need some fast nutrition while driving.  Tasty"
1;"""These are very good!  I like several of the flavors of these cookie and usually have one a few times per week.  Very convenient to eat in the car while taking my daughter to school.  Product is wholesome too"
1;This made an excellent Mother's Day gift.  My mom with discriminating taste is truly enjoying them.  They have just the right amount of small-sweetness for breakfast and a flavor she likes.  The packaging makes them good for a mail order gift.
1;"""This is my first Erin Baker Breakfast Cookie experience. I put all the cookies in the freezer upon arrival. I followed the supplied helpful hint to toast the cookies on the darkest setting.  Memories of my Grandmother's winter cookies warm from the oven commenced...tasty"
1;"""I was so excited to try these.  I am trying to find economical GOOD for you food.  I ate one of these and a cup of Joe and I was full. Delicious!  Heated it 20 seconds. That of course is unfrozen.  I immediately froze the rest to keep them fresh as no preservatives in them. I think you have to heat it about 40 seconds when frozen.  My son had one (He is 21) and he had to have two to fill him.  He likes them a lot. My Mom had one and she was full.  She could not quit talking about how good they are. Another reason  I also wanted to try these is because my Mom has Alzheimers and cannot cook on stove safely anymore. She likes to snack and get things herself so these are perfect.  She can still use the microwave. I feel these are healthy eating and that makes me feel good. We all have medical disabilities so the easier the better. The really cool part is that they are just a little over a 1.00 each for breakfast! We love the Morning Glory and am fixing to order more with Amazon Prime. By the way for those of you who don't know about Prime"
1;I don't buy my walnuts anywhere else. These taste great and are a fantastic price. I put most of them in the freezer and pull them out as I need them in order to ensure they stay fresh since 4 tubs lasts me quite a while.
1;"""I think Depeche Mode said it the best  I Just Can't Get Enough  and that is how I feel about these crackers.  They have a WONDERFUL flavor and are low in fat and calories.  A serving size is 17 crackers.  These are a great alternative to basic potato chips"
1;"""Sesame Rice Thins are the BEST tasting rice crackers I have tried - and I've tried several.  They stay crispy and crunchy and come in several flavors.  You won't be disappointed.  Amazon has the best price"
1;I added this to my order since I was going to be paying shipping charges anyway.  I didn't expect anything unusual.  There probably are as many jerk recipes as there are residents in Jamaica.  But this one surprised me pleasantly.  It wasn't full of sugar and added a really pleasant note to everything I cooked with it.  I will be buying it again.
1;For the longest time they would not ship this to APOs. I don't know why. Maybe they were afraid the yummy super bubble gum would fall into the hands of the enemy. Get flavor and one piece works. I chew gum every day in the gym because I grind my teeth when lifting. helps alot.
1;"""I love pasta but I hate the stuffed feeling I get after eating it and the high carb content.  I BOOUGHT these noodles FROM AMAZON because you can get them for a GREAT PRICE and FREE SHIPPING.  Unlike other reviewers I actually read the information provided for the customer so I can make an informed purchase.  I've had these noodles in both hot and cold dishes and they are fabulous.  No carbs"
1;I love this stuff.  I tried it earlier this summer while on Cape Cod and immediately had to go find some upon returning home!  It is like drinking chocolate!  It is dutch chocolate mixed with red wine.  mmmm.  New fave!
1;I bought one of these kits from the Epcot Center Down in Disney World last fall. Right now my tree is doing great! I was able to keep it alive indoors all winter. I potted it recently and now it is outside and is really happy:-) I think this kit is really good for somebody who is interested in bonsia and is just starting out! The tree that is included is really nice and you get all the supplies to get you going on the right path. Awesome!!!!! :-)
1;I've never had a bonsai before and was unsure where to go. I purchased the Japanese Juniper starter kit and when it arrived I was thrilled. Everything I needed was there and the instructions are very clear. The tree is very healthy and never showed any signs of stress. Thank You Eve's Garden!
1;Ive had my bonsai for about 3 days now. I love it! I was a little upset at first because this product wasn't eligible for prime but despite that the plant still arrived in 2 days after shipment. Everything was in place and the plant was lively and not damaged. Came with easy to follow instructions and guide. Would definitely recommend for the price.
1;Product was in good condition and met all my expectations.  The Bonsai was healthy and in excellent shape.  Potting was easy with instructions provided. My tree is doing very well. I would buy from here again.
1;"""This is the best cereal!  It's my favorite by far. It has a good flavor and an excellent crunch.  It's high in whole grains (9 different grains!) and protein.  It's good in milk or in yogurt.  It's also good as an ice cream topping.  My kids just call it  crunchies.   As in"
1;"""This is a great blend for Italian Sausage. It makes a mild sausage with a little kick. It does 50 lbs of sausage and I make it in 10 lb batches. I measured the level of the blend(5 ) and with a permanent marker made lines every inch on the container for my 10 lbs of meat. I ground up my shoulders"
1;"""This is the only brand I've been able to buy from any market that uses EXTRA VIRGIN Olive Oil. Most brands use cheaper non-virgin olive oil.<br /><br />I use a can of this stuff over leafy green salad and throw in a few cherry tomatoes. Shake it up and you have delicious high protein salad with no need for saturated fat/carb stuffed dressings.<br /><br />As for the other reviewers"
1;"""A good range of reviews here. I especially like the one that seeks to educate. That is unfortunate there are no more canneries here in the States.<br /><br />Here's my reality:<br /><br />I believe this company is out to put out quality products. And if your really concerned about their business practice do some due diligence. They have a website.<br /><br />I stopped for years eating anything out of a can. And for a single person I can't afford buying wild fish in bulk. I love the fact that this company puts out this product. Being of a Pacific Island decent (born and raised in the U.S  and proud to buy american) the food my ethnic community eats is a horrible combination with all that msg and salt. Not all asians eat vegetables. Particularly Filipino's. They fry everything and eat too much bread. It's the spanish influence. I respect their dietary choices but it didn't work for me.<br /><br />About 10 years ago I gradually shifted my health. I believe in moderation. And I do research the companies I buy from. I've never considered sardines. Then I tried the Sardines in Olive Oil and I am hooked.<br /><br />I study the health benefits of all things. I've been doing it for 10 years now. I study psychology and do yoga.<br /><br />Health first comes from your mind. It comes down to testing and learning what your body likes. It doesn't help to scare people into health. It doesn't work in the long run. I've met health freaks that worry so much about the negatives that it physiologically affects their health. There is such thing as too much information. You have to enjoy what you eat. Simple.<br /><br />I eat this stuff out of the can. The flavor is fantastic. It's great with some brown rice and veggies. I haven't quite made the transition to totally raw and I don't think I ever will but this is the next best thing.<br /><br />Price is not comparable to the price of your health. Most don't know how to measure that. The way I watch people waste their money on things like eating out"
1;"""These are some of the best tasting sardines we have ever had and the size is very impressive. There are about four large taste sardines per can.  I was lucky to get these from Amazon when they had them in stock it they came quickly and the the use by date is two years away"
1;Sardines used to gross me out but these aren't mushy or too stinky like some sardines you can get. I like how neatly packed they are in their little can. I just throw some hotsauce on em and chow down. These are my favorite by far and told my grandfather about them.<br /><br />The other reviews say more about the reviewers than the product.
1;"""I was never an eggnog fan until I tried this in a gourmet shop. Loved it. Sent my aunt who loves eggnog some and she loved it and requested more. The shop that I found it at sells out all the time. Obviously good stuff!  I never had problems opening container or with it not dissolving well"
1;"""Leila has a whole collection of beautiful pastries that are absolutely delicious.The cookies she creates can be custom designed to fit your personal needs for any occasion.Her packaging is simply divine and so very beautiful.She takes such pride in every detail to satisfy each and every customer individualy.I will use her for all my special party and personal gift needs.I know i can count on her 100% to make every purchase extra special.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00487MXS8 >Leilalove Gluten Free Cookies"
1;"""These treats are the best!  I break them into smaller pieces and use as training treats.  I would recommend dogswell to anyone.  My dogs LOVE these and the chicken jerky.  I love them because they do not cause any digestive  issues ..."""
1;"""My Jack Russell has problems with patella luxation. I decided against surgery after researching the success rate of it and 5 years after it was diagnosed she is still OK. I keep her weight down and give her plenty of long walks to stengthen her ligaments. The vet told me she would probably have problems with arthritis so I give her one of these chicken strips daily and also give her liquid glucosamine choindroitin on a small piece of bread. My dog loves the chicken strips"
1;I have been giving my dog Happy Hips for several years. It contains glucosamine and condroitin which is good for the joints. Amazon has absolutly the best price out there too. Your dog will beg for these treats.
1;I have a very fussy Yorksire terrier and a miniature schnauzer and both them absolutely love these treats.  I give them to them after they finish their breakfast and they bark at me if I forget!  I like the fact that they have no fillers or artificial ingredients because my dogs have food allergies. These treats are the greatest!
1;These dried chicken breasts are a healthy treat. They are expensive so my dogs each get 2 a day. Happy Hips are $16 a bag in grocery and pet stores so 3 bags for $30 is a real deal and they are worth it.
1;I like the Dogswell Happy Hips Chicken Breast because of the quality and lack of chemical additives. And both my cat and dog would eat only this if they could. Ordering auto ship saves even more from Amazon's discount pricing.
1;"""My dogs all seem to love these and will choose them over other treats. They have the added bonus of being fortified with glucosamine and chondroitin which are great for my aging dog's hips and joints. These are the best value that I've found for these and with Subscribe and Save"
1;My thirteen year old Yorkshire Terrier loves Dogswell Happy Hips Chicken breast strips and the glucosomine has helped her arthritis a great deal.  She jumps and runs like a puppy again!  My five year old yorkie loves them too!  I highly recommend this product.
1;My great dane has two torn acls and has arthritis in her hips... and she is ONLY three. Well we have done one surgery and will be doing the second next spring when she is healed. In the mean time I needed to find some DIFFERENT way to provide her with Glucosamine. Since she is so picky I needed something in a treat form. These are her FAVORITE thing to eat! I went to Petco and was going to buy ONE bag for $35 and realized this offer was for THREE bags at the same price. I could not be happier and neither can she. She has only been eating them for three weeks and is not even limping on her surgical knee (its been 8 weeks and it takes 12 weeks to fully heal). Even our vet is surprised she is doing this well and the only change was these treats! I recommend them to anyone who needs to help their pet enjoy their life to the fullest! BUY these! You wont regret it!!!!<br /><br />PS - I also bought the duck and she loves those too :)
1;"""We have two Great Pyrenees. One is 13 and the other is turning 9. As with all large breed dogs hips are a problem. What is more of a problem is getting them to take medications. Happy Hips is the solution. Our doggies love the taste"
1;"""my german shepherd loves these.  he's very picky about both his food and treats so it was a relief to find something he likes.  the package recommends giving him 4-6/day but that seems excessive--usually two or three throughout the day makes him happy.  they are in small strips"
1;My dog is 11 years old and has a bad back. He is a VERY picky eater.  He LOVES these treats and asks for them if we forget to give him one. (Which is seldom because he is so spoiled) There is a bit more of a perk in his step since we've discovered this product. The cost here on Amazon is fantastic too because the stores have been charging me $7.99 a bag. (NYC prices yikes)
1;"""i have a service dog who is in kidney failure from birth and she is still ok but ets her nutrition form my cooking and these treats give her the supplements for her bones. I am a cancer patient and i think they are of good wuality so far.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NXDM30 >Autumn of Blessed Acres service dog</a>"""
1;We've got 2 golden retrievers and these are one of their favorite treats.

1;I have been hunting for a decent treat for my GSD.  She just had TPLO surgery and has been recovering nicely.  I did a search for healthy treats and came across these happy hips.  The ingredients are natural and she absolutely loves them.  The idea that it is also benefitial for her joints adds a special bonus to the product.  No sugar or garbage in these.  I have been keying in on more protein in her diet as she has had digestive problems.  She has had not problems since I changed.  You can't go wrong with these.
1;"""Ugh.<br /><br />We've been buying Happy Hips treats for our 14 year old black lab/springer spaniel mix for about a year because they are SO beneficial for her arthritis.  We bought a batch of the Beef Liver to add a little variety to the whole routine - and oh"
1;"""My puppy loves these vitality treats. After reading the other two reviews I became concerned and quickly e-mailed the company with my concerns. Here is what they replied to me which immediately relieved my worries. They also sent me documentation of their checks on the products and pictures of the non-caged chickens.<br /><br />Hello Karen"
1;My dog LOVES Happy Hips.  Because we have Amazon auto ship she now loves the delivery man because she knows he brings them to her.  She gets very sad if we run out. You can't get any better than Amazon auto ship.
1;These treats are a wonderful way for me to keep my old dog moving. He enjoys them and I enjoy being able to give him joint supplements and the benefit of real meat in his diet.  Thank you Dogswell for this great product and thanks to Amazon the good price.
1;"""I found Dogswell products 7 years ago when my vet recommended the Glucosa-Chondro chicken strips to help my dog who had just had patella luxation surgery on both his knees. The vet said the supplements would help my little one avoid arthritis in his later years. I'd say so! He's pushing 8.5 yo and doesn't show any signs of slowing down even though he has pins in both knees. He jumps high"
1;"""I used this to make homemade pastrami. Very hard to find locally and online. If you are dry curing meats this is necessary.  Made excellent Pastrami many times next I will have to try Bacon  the maple Kind ."""
1;My premie baby born at 29 weeks weighing 1 lb 15 oz is gaining weight very nicely.  I breast fed for the first 4 months and fortified the breast milk with Neosure powder. I had to go back to work and placed him on the liquid formula.  Now he is on just Neosure every 3 hours. He is now about to turn 7 months and still not ready for solid foods but doing great with Neosure. He weighs 12 lbs. He loves this formula. I'm thrilled with his progress. Also I love the ease of use of these disposable bottles.
1;"""For years I've walked by the tuna aisle in the grocery store and seen canned chicken.<br />My initial thought was...ewwww.<br />It just struck me as just plain wrong that chicken would be stuck in a can.<br />Then out of curiosity I picked up a can and......as soon as I opened the can it was like a revelation.<br />I drained it and no chunks came out with the water.<br />Sure enough I opened the can and all I saw were juicy chunks of white meat.<br />Perfect for salads"
1;"""This is my daughter's favorite. Lindt chocolate is one of the best I know on the market. But: this time I want to review also this shipper. This shipper deserves 10 stars!<br />The chocolate was shipped on days with extremely high temperatures and I was worried in what shape it's going arrive to. Surprise was on my side: all chocolates were in zipped food storage bag"
1;These bars are huge! The price is phenomenal for the amount and quality of chocolate and nuts.<br />I'm glad that I went for the quantity to get the best deal. I can always put a couple bars in the freezer.
1;In the beginning I tried to cancel the order because I felt that it was not what I wanted exactly which is (Lindt Gold Bar).<br />But It was a great surprise to find in the package what I wanted exactly. The image here is an old one that should be updated.<br />The packaging was great with thermal insulation and cold packs for the chocolate not to melt in the hot summer.<br />the price is really the lowest. I searched the internet to find a better price and the best I got was 7.50 usd per each + shipping.<br />That's why I said it is JUST PERFECT. It made my day
1;"""I was making Valentine Brownie Pops for my Grandsons' classroom party. I dipped them in white chocolate and sprinkled with Wilton's Micro Heart sprinkles. After the chocolate set I put them in individual bags and tied them closed with a red bow.<br /><br />I could not believe how many Moms asked me where I bought the Brownie Pops. I usually find fault with the presentation of my homemade goodies but I have to admit"
1;"""I began purchasing this coffee at a small boutique coffee shop not far from where I live.  Now I have 5 lbs. of it delivered to my door on a predetermined schedule.  Life's good!  The coffee is amazing"
1;"""Peas came in good condition. Cans were not dented and the peas themselves were not mushy. Great for quick meals and a very reasonable price compared to the cost per can at a regular grocery store. Other pros include: BPA free can"
1;"""I bought these on super sale because I needed them for a pie crust and they were cheap.  I got the 3-pack and was at first dismayed to find that they were not packed like other graham crackers are usually packed"
1;"""These are the best tasting peanuts I've so far had in my life.  They possibly could the best peanuts ever but I haven't tried all of them yet so I'll hedge my review there.  The peanuts are crunchy and fresh and just right salty.  So much better than anything I can buy in my local supermarket"
1;"""For years I have used Knorr Bernaise sauce packets with steaks that I found at the grocery store.  I found it to be quite expensive (about $5.00 a packet plus milk and butter).  Upon researching some other food products"
1;"""I am so excited to find that I can purchase Sugar-free Werther's from Amazon !!!  They are delivered right to my door and I dont have to go out and buy them from some store.  They have such a small amount of calories"
1;"""I absolutely cannot be without my Spike - it is my one essential seasoning and I use it on almost everything.  Buying it in bulk is cost effective and insures that even when I can't find it in the stores"
1;These are every bit as good as the other two reviewers stated. Awesome butter cookies!!! There's a lot of butter taste in these cookies and they're not overly sweet. Just right! I'll be buying again when the 12 pack runs out. Amazon please make sure you keep these in stock on a continuing basis!
1;These cookies didn't disappoint.  They are delicious and go really well with a cup of tea or coffee.  They have just the right amount of sweetness...not cloying.  (I think American desserts usually go overboard on sugar).  I highly recommend them.
1;Having grown up on these cookies I was pleased to see that they now come in the more healthful whole wheat version.  Same great taste...light on the sugar...even my husband who hates sweets will eat these with his ice cream.
1;This is without a doubt the most incredibly addictive packaged cookie in the world. The dark chocolate dipping at one end is a great contrast to the rolled wafer of the cookie itself. Why did I ever buy a whole case! Bless Amazon for carrying the Bahlsen line of fabulous cookies because it is not available in Montana.
1;Once you try this piece of chocolate you will fall in love with it. Probably one of the best nonbar chocolates produced in Switzerland and Europe as a whole. And I think it is rather cheap for the quality you get.
1;I am very happy with Amazon service including the speedy shipment. I am also very happy the product Amazon is carrying. This product is only available in selected specialty stores in the area. And tend to be expensive. Sometime they only carry small selection in store. You have to wait long time for a special order. Amazon is making the product available with a wide selection of variaty and affortable. Thanks.
1;A light and crisp flaky cookie surrounding a brightly flavorful nugget of jam. The only problem - I can eat a whole box without stopping to breathe! And buying them by the case makes them very affordable. My next order is already in...
1;"""I absolutley LOVE Gevalia coffee and was SOOOOO happy to see that it is available on Amazon for a reasonable price!  It's cheaper than in any local store. I am definitely a coffee connoisseur and find Gevalia to be the best coffee on the market. French roast has a very deep"
1;"""I have to warn that my review is going to sound like I sell this product.<br />I wish I know how to make them but I don't.<br /><br />Next time you have minor digestive issues or stomach gas or nausea try one of these babies!<br />Just put it on your tongue and take in the juices.<br />You will feel better in 5 minutes.<br /><br />Just a little bit of history.<br />When I was growing up"
1;My husband cannot get enough of this product.  He practically licks the can clean!!  The nuts are delicious and Amazons prices and shipping are the lowest.  You get your order in a remarkably quick time.
1;"""If you love Macadamia Nuts you know they can be $$$ but you will still pay because there is a difference with Mauna Loa.  I ordered these and the butter toffee.  They tasted as good as when purchased in HI.  The price was amazing!  I will order more.  They are the smaller cans that you find in the store.  Fresh"
1;These nuts are to die for! And I agree with the other reviewers ... they are absolutely addictive. I'm not a coffee drinker so I wasn't sure I'd like the taste. But they are delicious. Just barely a hint of a coffee flavor to them
1;"""Shame on me for not checking out the price before buying.  Paid $3 too much.  But it is a good product if you have a dog with allergies.  My dog loves the treats.  Will definately buy this product again"
1;"""I almost hesitate to give a review because this is my  secret ingredient  in so many things.<br /><br />My husband is from SLO and when we first met I thought it was so weird that the only thing he wanted from his mom for birthdays and holidays was Pepper Plant Sauce (I don't do spicy so I never tried it).  Then he got some of the seasoning.  Now I understand.  We use it in and on everything - eggs"
1;I have been using Core Power (formerly Athlete's HoneyMilk) for over a year and I won't use any other product. I add it to smoothies and even use it in recipes that call for milk. If you are tired of the chalky tasting 'milks' out there then stop looking and start drinking Core Power.
1;I found out about this product a year ago when I began training for an ironman. The long training days and intense interval work was beating my body down. I needed something I could take that would help get me ready for the next day's training. I have had nothing but great experiences since incorporating this into my workout regime. Vanilla Core Power reminds me of soft serve ice cream!
1;Vanilla is by far my favorite flavor.  It tastes like vanilla bean ice cream so you'd never know you were doing something good for your body.  Lactose free so it's tummy friendly and packed full of protein for a post workout recovery.  This drink couldn't get any better!
1;"""These muffins are great.  I've tried many gluten free foods and wasted so much money on things that tasted like cardboard.  I make these muffins  by substituting milk for the water and add 2 mashed bananas and 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  I've tried adding pineapple but didn't like it as much as my version of banana muffins.  My daughter's boyfriend loves these muffins and has no idea that they are made from rice flour.  Another great Namaste item to try is the Spice Cake.  Just add some grated carrots"
1;"""This bag is awesome. It has shaved several minutes off my morning routine. I can see all my makeup easily. Bag folds up well with magnetic closure. Travels well. Not good if you are someone with a lot of make up. I can fit several eyeshadows"
1;This case holds a lot and can still fold up well. Great function and looks nice too. The magnet works very well to keep it closed. I'm impressed with this product and will probably look at more of their travel accessories.
1;I grew up eating the original Life cereal and immediately switched to the cinnamon variety when they released it years ago. This is my favorite cereal and I am already out of the two 4-packs I ordered two weeks ago.
1;Like these with subtle hint of Cinnamon and low sweetness. Nice improvement over some other too sweet Cinnamon cereals. I think the packaging may add up too much to the cost - shall be able to buy in large packets for the family.
1;this is a great topping for popcorn and i have been using it for years.<br /><br />PS I had written Amazon on October 6th when I received the order because 2 of the bottles were broken--I have not gotten a response.  would appreciate acknowledgement!
1;Reese's is consistently excellent.  Always makes the popcorn taste great.<br /><br />Wouldn't use any other brand.  I buy in bulk.<br /><br />I prefer the plain salt version (no additives) - but cheesy is quite good.
1;I just love this tea! I only drink decaf after 6pm or so or I cannot sleep. I'm always on the lookout for a great unique tea - and this one fits to a T!<br /><br />I thought the vanilla flavor was not overly strong but you can clearly taste it. No bitter or strange after taste and it is suitably strong but not overly so.<br /><br />Enjoy!
1;I absolutely love Bigelow Decaffeinated French Vanilla Tea.  One sip and I was sold.  The wonderful vanilla flavor is like no other.  I love that my brain is tricked into thinking there is a sweet taste so I never have to add sugar - saves on the calorie count!  My students have even commented on how wonderful my room smells when they enter in the mornings - it's that warming vanilla smell.  Yum!
1;Our local stores have stopped carrying this product in the Decaf version.  I found the Decaf is smoother tasting than the Regular French Vanilla.  I bought 4 boxes I was so excited to see it.  I have enough to last for a while now!!
1;"""LOVE THIS TEA! COULD NOT FIND ANY MORE ! I FINALLY FOUND HERE ! THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING THIS AVAILABLE!LOVE THE FACT IT IS DECAF!SO I CAN ENJOY IN THE EVENING! TASTES GREAT !ANY TIME OF DAY! HOT OR COLD! ADD CINNAMON! AND MILK"
1;"""Great vanilla smooth taste plain or I also add a little 1% milk and a sweet n' low for a relaxing treat without any guilt.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG0BPW >Bigelow Decaffeinated French Vanilla Tea"
1;These raw snacks are delicious. They are definately my favorite among the raw snack choices! If you are a raw foodist and miss the old fashioned Doritos you will surely enjoy these as a replacement. I am so glad to find the on Amazon. it is hard to find them in the stores since raw snack are hard to find! I am going to stock up! Problem is I eat way to many of them ( just like when I ate straight from the Doritos bag) ...atleast they are good for me!! You have to give them a try!!
1;Always try try to ration my spice usage. Getting a fresh batch and smelling and tasting the change in my dishes made me realize how I've been cheating myself by being thrifty. Use it or loose it. So much less expensive then retail grocery.
1;"""Our 2 year old son is affected by Celiac disease and since his diagnosis we have had a difficult time finding snacks that are easy to take out on a play date or to a park.  The  Glutino Apple Cinnamon Rings  serve that purpose very well for us and he LOVES them.  They don't taste like your typical cereal that contains flour - of course they don't.  But for someone who is on a gluten free diet and is accustomed to way the way that processed gluten free food tastes"
1;"""I was first introduced to astronaut ice cream about 2-3 years ago and it is amazing and really fun to eat. I have a 4 & 8 year old boys and a 15 year old nephew that love these. They definitely are quite different from a real scoop of ice cream out of the freezer"
1;"""Bluebirds aren't the only birds that love these.  Nuthatches and Woodpeckers love these too.  I mix them with mealworms in a small bluebird feeder and my bluebirds stayed all year.  They even nested in one of my nest boxes(4 or 5 fledglings)"
1;"""I've been feeding my dog Merrick canned food mixed with some Halo dry food for four months now.  He loves it (he's a picky eater) and he's super healthy!  I've heard some reviews that say this food leads to gassiness and diarrhea... I imagine that could be true if someone was switching their dog from a very low quality dry or canned food because this is a wholesome"
1;These are so delicious!! I usually don't like mint chocolate candies but my goodness! I fell in love! The chocolate will literally melt in your mouth. I gave some to my co workers and they kept asking for more! So these are my new favorite candy!
1;I've enjoyed this bar when being gone for the day hiking and exploring.  So easy to stick in my pocket and savor when lunchtime approaches.  Eating it slowly helps me enjoy more fully.  I keep a stash of them at home.  Great for taking on trips.  They were somewhat difficult to find and I was glad to find a selection at Amazon.
1;"""Called  Frozen Tongue  this was the second flavored released by ALTOIDS in 1998.<br /><br />ALTOIDS mints were first produced in England at the turn of the 19th century during the reign of King George III.<br /><br />Ingredients: sugar"
1;"""What the heck is going on with Lipton Darjeeling?  It disappeared from every one of the Indian shops in the S.F. Bay area about 6 months ago.  The tin you see above sold for about $11.  This tea was one of the best kept secrets I know.  Now the only tea approaching ... and I mean it is not as good ... it is Peet's Darjeeling"
1;"""Brings out the wolf in your dog!!! My dogs went crazy for these! They last forever and they clean their teeth better than any greenie or other dental chew.  A couple of my dogs that had horrible plaque build up look like they went to the the vet for a dental cleaning!! Absolute dog utopia!!! Just keep an eye on them if you have more than one dog because if they are not used to having treats like this"
1;My dog is on a meat free diet due to severe food allergies. It seems to have very good quality ingredients and she loves it. It does seem to cause a very soft stool but hopefully it will firm up over time.
1;"""My 12 year old golden has a new life with this food.  She had a lackluster appetite before Merrick came into our home.  I found it at a local organic pet store.  Their price was ridiculous - nearly $3 per can.  I bought a few to try -  I was amazed at the results!  I haven't seen my 75 lb. dog jump vertical with glee in many years.  I mix it with her dry food.  One can will last 3-4 days.  The difference in her level of activity and enthusiasm is unbelievable!  I went to the local store to negotiate their price on buying bulk based on what I could get it on line and the best they could do was a 10% discount.  Needless to say"
1;My dog gets bored easily of her food. We tried every different kind of food to get her appetite going again. Merrick's Turducken and Wing-a-ling did the trick. We mix it with her dry food and she is so happy! She gets very excited at mealtime. I have noticed a difference in her coat and energy level too.
1;"""I've tried all kinds of hemp powders and this is my favorite.  Hemp is a super source of EFA's and the protein is a highly available type due to the amount of different amino acids. It is good for those with animal milk allergies or who are concerned about cruelty to farm animals.  And it is also good for those of us who need to avoid the estrogenic properties of ingesting too many soy products.<br /><br />Great"
1;"""This shake is really tasty and is fairly filling too! It took me a while to figure out how to mix it - the first few times the protein would just clump up in my almond milk instead of completely dissolving. BUT this is easily fixed - just dissolve however much hempshake you will use in a little bit of water first"
1;"""Nutiva's chocolate hemp shake is not your average tasting protein shake. It is definitely different and could for many have to be an acquired taste. It is not as sweet as some would guess but is versatile so adding fruit"
1;"""I was very pleased with the shake. I sometimes mixed it with water and rice milk. Based on the other reviews I went slowly so not to get too much fiber at once. I go easy with anything to change digestion. But it is really good. I eventually used less and mixed it with the hemp protein"
1;I Love this product!! The shake is great mixed with vanilla almond milk it's AMAZING!!! I am going to be buying for the rest of my life and I will be buying it from Amazon. It's so much cheaper than anywhere else!!! Enjoy!!
1;"""This tastes great. At first it tastes a bit strange but i enjoyed the slight coffee taste. I mixed the Amazing Green Superfood (the chocolate version) with it which made the Amazing Green taste much better. I need to buy more of this Hemp Shake since i'm out. It really makes the Amazing Green taste much better. I mix it with milk using a little wisk"
1;"""I agree with the others that say this is one of the best hemp shakes out there. I started off with the original Nutiva hemp powder and once I finished that I decided to try the chocolate. It is amazing! It is much easier for me to gulp this down in the morning. I mix it up in a Blender Bottle (also sold on Amazon) with a little water and some type of milk. I really like mixing it with vanilla hemp milk or whole grain rice milk but regular milk works fine"
1;"""Pepperidge Farm is one of the few national companies that mass markets distinctive cookies.  One of those cookies is the marvelous Orange Milano cookie.  When you bite into this crunchy cookie you get a hint of chocolate as you reach the center"
1;We used to get Gyro's all the time in NY - but cannot get good ones here in TN..we bought the gyro meat and it was AWESOME!  So easy to make and the customer service at the company helped me with a recipe for the sauce that I could make at home!  We will be buying more in the future - WE LOVE IT!!!  Thank you SO MUCH for making this available.
1;Walkers treacle toffees are the best treacle with most desirable chewing consistency and taste. This package was well priced and delivery was prompt. I wish there was a larger per pack amount available.
1;"""I'm not the biggest fan of hotsauces but I was interested in trying this one because the singer of The Offspring is the man that created the sauce and sells it.  I was pleasantly surprised with how good the sauce tastes"
1;"""I don't usually like hot sauce because all they do is burn my mouth but I am now literally hooked on GB. I don't know what they put in it but there is so much flavor and it's so perfectly balanced that it makes pretty much everything taste better"
1;"""My dogs love these treats and I have to say I dont blame them they smell soo good(dont worry I never tasted them) and I feel good in giving my  babies  healthy treats that are made in the US not china (hard to come by)Another good flavor is their pumpkin and apple."""
1;"""Eukanuba has created this specialized breed food for certain dogs and my Dachshunds have benefited from this food by having a healthy coat and weight. I order on line because there is no one who sells this specialized breed dog food in Alamosa"
1;"""According to the research I've done and my vet's recommendation Eukanuba is the right brand for my Dachshund.  I tried Orijen for a few months when he was about 2 years old but my dog's weight skyrocketed from 16 to 22lbs.  My vet thought the Orijen was the cause and recommended I switch back to Eukanuba.  After I put him back on this Dachshund formula he dropped the weight and is back to a healthy 16 lb.  He's now 4.5 years old and doing great.<br /><br />If I thought there was a better brand of food for him I would be open to trying it"
1;"""My family has been on a hunt for crackers that are lower in carbohydrates and these fit the bill. We eagerly purchased a box and were delighted to find that they are the best crackers ever. Even if I did not have to restrict my carbohydrate intake"
1;"""My Maltese absolutely loved the old Greenies.  Then they changed their  recipe  and she wouldn't even try the new version.  Turned up her nose and that was that.  I can't recall the exact names of the other types of  Greenies  out there and there are only a few"
1;"""I need hard sugar free candy to suck for dry mouth caused by medication I am on.  I bought this candy without ever having tried them since I can't buy them locally. What a wonderful surprise to find that they have plenty of delicious flavor"
1;"""Vegan. Natural. Raw. Kosher. Wonderful whole raw macadamias. Great on everything. Delightfully tender nuts. Not dry roasted or cooked in oil. No added salt or any other ingredients. Just macs. Value size can be divided for many treats. Great for baking. Melt your favorite vegan dark chocolate and dip and cool for chocolate mac love. Large 2 lb. (907g) package. Portion control highly recommended. Repackage in smaller or snack sized bags. 1/4 cup (34g/1.2 oz) is about 12-14 whole mac nuts. Highly caloric. Each of these full servings is 270 calories. A half serving of 6-7 whole pieces would be only 135 calories. About 27 whole servings or 53 half servings per bag. Great value. Also available dry roasted for those who don't prefer raw"
1;"""Wisdom Natural Brands Stevia Dark Concentrate is a chocolate lover's answer to the taste without the calories! I always use it in my coffee. It sweetens & flavors it just right! The only thing that bothered me once I received my order was that the label says chocolate"
1;These peanuts have a crispness and flavor it is remarkable. You can almost snap them. Their flavor is clean and sharp. I would highly recommend these peanuts to anyone that would like to taste what a great roasted peanut should be.
1;"""Royal Oak Peanuts are simply the best tasting premium virginia peanuts we could find. We have them on automatic delivery every 4 months. These are  bliser style  peanuts cooked in high heat causing the peanut to blister and become somewhat crunchy and firm.  The unique taste is much better than any brand in supermarkets. Be sure to check Amazon for specials. I saved 25% off of the $23.99 list price with free shipping.  ENJOY! JJJ"""
1;Found these peanuts about 12 years ago when I lived in Virginia. Although I moved to SW United States I still order them on a regular basis. They use only the best nuts and cook them just right so they have the crunch and great flavor you expect from Virginia style peanuts.
1;"""We do have a  Snack Group  at work. We used to buy everything from Pretzels to candy to bubble gum to snack on around 3 PM at work. A colleague got some caramel coated peanuts from his vacation in Williamsburg. That is where our  addiction  to peanuts began.<br />Since I had prime membership on Amazon"
1;"""I love Virginia peanuts and these are among the best I've ever had. They are nice and crunchy with just the right amount of salt. I eat a handful of them a day as a treat and would highly recommend them"
1;I agree with the majority of other people who have reviewed these peanuts.  I have tried the Peanut Shop's peanuts and have been a devoted fan for years but after reading the reviews here of Royal Oak peanuts I decided to give them a try.  Very glad that I did.  The size and texture has Peanut Shop peanuts beat cold!  And you get more for a better price - how can you beat that?
1;"""Tazo Awake Full Leaf Tea is the best black tea I have ever tasted.  It is much better than the ground tea bags you would find in the grocery store (even of the same brand and type!).  It is very smooth"
1;Tazo Zen is a great tasting green tea.  I would recommend to others at least to try.  They serve it at Starbuck's stores so it would be better to try there first (although they will charge you $2 for a small).
1;"""My veterinary dermatologist recommended these for my 1 year old yellow lab as a crunchy replacement for rawhides while we try to figure out what he is allergic to.  He absolutely loves them!  A large piece only lasts for a few minutes for him"
1;I've been looking for this preserve for my wife. This is her favorite preserves. She is a california girl and grew up in the knott's berry farm park area. She had this perserve most morings for breakfast. Could not find it any where here in Arkansas and thought I would try Amazon. I really made points when this package arrived. Great stuff. Thank you.
1;"""Best coffee I have found to buy. I used to buy<br />It at CostCo for at least half the cost on here.<br />CostCo no longer sells it. Hard to believe they<br />Would drop such a gem. Maybe(hopefully) they will<br />Bring it back. It's a very strong"
1;I am 78 and have been drinking coffee all my life. Began drinking Espresso in Italy in the 1950's. Each morning I make a double Espresso.That is my coffee intake for the day. I seldom drink 'regular coffee' as it is far too weak. We all have different taste but for me this is one of the best coffee's on the market.
1;"""I've used these before and they are quite aromatic and make a great cup of coffee.  I just bought a couple of bags at Costco and they still have them for $13.99 for a three lb. bag.  I tried the Sumatra coffee and really liked that as well.  So far I have not been disappointed with any of the Kirkland coffee beans.  I tend to like a more robust coffee and this one fills the bill.  Ever since I started grinding my own coffee beans I can't see going back.  I was almost in  crisis mode  as I was down to less than a pound of coffee and need my morning java.  Give this one a try."""
1;"""The Kirkland Signature bagged coffee's are Great. Each roast has its season and I've found that I like all three so I'm good all year around.  But buy from Costco they are now about $19.00 a bag.<br /><br />Rwandan"
1;"""I just finished my first bag of this Rwandan coffee and was quite disappointed when I went to my local COSTCO and found they had none in stock.  I'm glad I can order it on Amazon.  I tried many different brands"
1;We were very disappointed when Costco did'nt carry it anymore. When I found it on Amazon it really made our day. We were Starbucks fans for so long and when we took a chance on this Rwandan coffee it turned out to be better than Starbucks! GOOD STUFF!!!
1;These dried Bing cherries are absolutely delicious. I have used them with wild rice and toasted pecans for a side dish. I plan to use them with a roast pork tenderloin soon. Excellent quality and price.
1;"""I've tried all sorts of bottled and canned pizza sauces for years.  None were better than mediocre and some were really awful.  I would always go back to my  polpo  which I make with a base of Muir Glen diced tomatoes - tasty but still would dump too much water on the crust while baking.  Finally tried the Pastorelli.  BOY IS IT GOOD!!!!<br />Good tomatoey flavor"
1;"""For years and years I have scoured the land in search of a pizza sauce that will quench my everlasting desire for pizza sauce and cheese in a bowl. After my ancestors spent forty years in the desert and several thousand years in other places"
1;This is a very tasty gourmet cracker! It has a taste of the sesame seeds and seasonings.  Most crackers are overwhelmed with a salty taste so you can't enjoy your dips or spreads but this is just perfect! I eat them without any kind of spreads or dips also!  Try some you will love it too!
1;These are our favorite snack crackers.  They are crisp and thin with a wonderful but subtle flavor that goes great with any topping.  We  ordered two cartons (24 packages) and they arrived in perfect condition with very few broken unlike many we have purchased locally.
1;"""I recently got more cravings for sardines and I didn't want to pay $2-3 for a can of sardines. I saw these and thought hmm... maybe I'll give it a try. Definitely worth the money. So I think in my opinion it tastes really good. The smoke flavor is there and it enhances the flavor of sardines. It's a pretty decent portion and easy pull tab. I haven't tried any of the fancier sardines like from Spain or something"
1;I have a subscription for these to get a case (50 cans) every 2 months. The fish are fair sized with 5 to a can. The only complaint I have is that the scales sometimes detract. It says packed in oil but it is really an oil/water broth. I pop the can and pour it down the sink. Recommended.
1;"""So glad I was able to find these on Amazon at a good price. My local store stopped selling these in this molasses flavor & these are the healtiest biscuits around due to the limited ingredients (only 5).  My dog loves them and I know they're not filled with a bunch of fat or salt. I will be re-ordering when I'm low again. Everyone's dog should be eating these for a treat instead of the grocery store junk.  Petco sells Buddy Biscuits"
1;"""i received two 9 in x 9 1/2 inch bags containing 1 pound of anise seeds.  i am so stoked about the the culinary possibilities.  the spices were fresh and smelled wonderful.  i will buy from FRONTIER again.  i looked up some info on the Internet which indicated that to impart a stronger flavor to toast before using.  I CANNOT WAIT TO START COOKING!!!  thank you"
1;"""Haribo's gummi strawberries are some of the tastiest candy available. I may be biased because I've loved gummi candies (ESPECIALLY those from Haribo) for pretty much my entire life. There's just something about the perfect combination of texture and bite that make chowing down on chewy fruit-flavored candy a happy activity.<br /><br />Strawberries are one of my favorite fruits so naturally I was overjoyed when I found out many years ago that Haribo made a gummi strawberry candy that"
1;"""I have been on a quest to find the most nutritious dog food for the last year. After trying various brands this one is the definite and obvious winner. My dogs are seniors but they prefer the puppy recipe to the senior recipe. The puppy one is loaded with protein and nutrients which make their coats shine. They love the food"
1;"""These cookies are so good. I love them. I first had them on our round-trip flight to Hawaii last fall. I asked for extra. I recently discovered them at a national chain drugstore and here they are on amazon"
1;"""I first ran across these cookies while in Germany during the Christmas season.  They were selling them at a festival and I was hooked.  I would contact my friends to send me more each Christmas when they could find them at the various fests.  The next time I ran into them was on a Delta flight when I found they could be ordered on the internet.  They are amazing"
1;These cookies are difficult to find in my local store.  I received several packages of cookies.  They came to my door without any of them broken which impressed me because that seldom happens when I purchase them at the store.
1;My wife recently traveled on Delta and loved these Biscoff cookies they were serving. She asked me to order some for her online and I found a great price for them on Amazon. She has been very happy with the taste and high quality of these european style cookies. Her friends and relatives love them too. To tell you the truth I love them too.
1;"""The package came as promised.<br />Packing: the packing was good and not damaged.<br />Product: i had been looking for these airline cookies for a while now and have found it. I have looked in stores locally and was not able to find. I. Short"
1;"""I used to buy this Mexican version at my local Wal-Mart until they quit selling it.  The mexican version tastes better that the American version. This one ACTUALLY tastes like chocolate milk!  It is richer"
1;"""My Family used to Lived in South of Greece (Attika)<br />Few of my friends used to share home made Olive oil.<br />it is common that regular House hold in Greece produce own olive oil<br />at home. its all good and so wonderful!<br />So rich in Good taste. very hard to fine in any finest<br />market"
1;"""I bought this for my mother's 50th birthday. She loved space-food sticks as a kid but it was more of a nostalgia thing than a  tasted amazing  thing. We all know space-food sticks taste like modeling clay. But this assortment of food with the retro space-food sticks magnet was perfect.<br /><br />She loved the gift and the dried cinnamon apples and peaches were delicious! I wish they sold them in large quantities outside of the space-food package.<br /><br />(The strawberry section of the space ice cream was delicious as well)"""
1;This makes for an exciting gift for any child.  It opens the door for learning about the space program.  It would be great in conjunction with a trip to Kennedy Space Center and is cheaper than the astronaut food that they sell in the giftshops there.
1;"""I've been looking for a great coffee for the last six months.  I've gone throw lbs of numerous brands and finally just finished my 5lb bag of the<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWMD2I >Dark Brazilian Santos"
1;"""This is not the best coffee I've had. The best coffee I've had was shade grown and organic and from Cuba. The second best coffee I ever had passed through the digestive system of a rodent. I'm that guy. This coffee is pretty good. Not the best"
1;I used JCS Oxtail & Stew Seasoning as part of my cooking routine. The flavors blended well with my stew and vegetables to give it a unique bold flavor. I would recommend this seasoning as a woman's spice essential.
1;We enjoyed this coffee and would recommend it to others.  The coffee came pre-ground so there was no need for bean grinding.  I would say this is a medium blend coffee without any bitterness.  It would appeal to a variety of people as we certainly enjoyed it.
1;"""I must admit that I had never tried any style of Melitta coffee before this Cafe Collection Classique Supreme.  I am an avid coffee drinker and have at leat 6 cups every morning.  It is just part of my regular routine.  I crave the cafeine and the taste just wakes me up and starts any day perfectly.  I always get a medium blend and find that with generic coffee be it Folgers"
1;The aroma from this coffe when I opened the bag was amazing.  The coffee flavor was bold and yet not overpowering.  It was not bitter and had a nice crisp flavor. My husband also enjoyed it.  Would be curious to try the same coffee if it comes in decaf to see if it retains its flavor.<br />Would serve this to guests at a dinner party.
1;"""I'm accustomed to grinding my own coffee beans and steeping them in a French press.  I've sort of become spoiled by the better flavor of having my morning brew done this way.<br /><br />When I received a bag of Melitta Cafe Collection"
1;I was really surprised about how good this coffee is.  I normally buy a Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts bag at the grocery store but his is right up there in quality and the price is a little better.  The coffee itself is very fresh and has a strong black nutty flavor that I really like.  Enjoy:)
1;"""I am not a coffee connoisseur by any means. I only know what I like and what my family likes to drink.  Gourmet coffees to me taste pretty much the same as a good ole can of generic coffee.  Until I tried the Melitta Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Ground Coffee.  First off I noticed that the flavor was not too strong.  I am not a fan of coffee that tastes like sludge and lean towards the medium to light roasts most of the time.  Secondly"
1;"""Classique Supreme is the second of the Melitta Gourmet Coffee Cafe Collection coffees I've tried. (I received free samples for review of the Classique Supreme and the Hazlenut Creme Brulee.) And I am quite pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />My coffee of choice to date"
1;"""We love having fun with the Gold Flakes.  Guests chuckle and ohh and ahh over having gold shaken into their cocktals.<br /><br />The Edible Gold Flakes also make the ultimate hostess gift.<br /><br />Thanks to the seller"
1;"""I saw this on Dr Oz about keeping blood glucose steady throughout the night if you take 2 teaspoon fulls before bedtime.  It really does work!!!!  It has a really strong almond taste to it that I don't fancy"
1;I love this stuff as I drink it everyday with my coffee. I previously used stevia but it seems to leave a nasty aftertaste which is why I love Ideal. It tastes great. Im a pre-diabetic but I've fooled my tastebuds into believing this is sugar.
1;"""Today I tried the spaghetti Tofu Shirataki noodles by House Foods. I would give these noodles a five stars if it weren't for the pre-preparation that is involved. I found these at my local Asian mart for about $2.00.<br /><br />First you must rinse these noodles well because the liquid they come in smells like a lake (you should prepare yourself for the smell). Second"
1;"""I first heard about Shirataki noodles years ago and decided I would try it.  I went to Fiesta and got these Tofu Shirataki Noodle.  Shirataki are made from Konjac yams and the added tofu gives it a harder texture. The noodles without tofu added is 0 calories.  The one with tofu is 20 cal per 4 oz which is low in cal. I always rinse the noodles first. I never cook it longer than 3 minutes. The first time I ever made Shirataki Noodles I cooked it like regular pasta and it turned into a gel--this was years ago. I learned that was the worst mistake to make and changed how I make these noodles. The next time I made it correctly and tried to eat it with pasta sauce. That didn't work for me"
1;"""I tried both these and just the plain shirataki noodles with zero calories purchased at my local Asian market and I prefer these the best. The plain Shirataki feel like a noodle shaped gummie candy when you eat them...not as hard but too 'slippery'..The House Brand with tofu didn't have that same 'slippery' taste. I didnt find preperation to be that bothersome as a couple of posters have mentioned. I just open them and pour them in a strainer and let the water run over them throughly"
1;They came fast and the bags are in good shape.  You really have to be sure to wash and dry these several times. I just put a simple tomato sauce on it and it didn't taste bad at all. But you have to wash them very good and then heat them with what ever sauce you are going to use.
1;"""They kind of have an acquired consistency that you need to get used to. The texture reminds me sort of like cooked mushrooms. They have a slightly rubbery snap to them. The first time I tried them I hated them. I started the Atkins diet and now that I never eat chips or pasta I have learned to get used to them"
1;"""I heard about these through Hungry-girl.com and am so glad I tried them.  I kept hearing how I should replace pasta with spaghetti squash and found the texture and taste to be unsatisfying.  Although these need to be rinsed well and patted thoroughly dry"
1;"""I do not have human children so I can only comment on how this works for my furry kids. I have a cat with severe pancreas/GI issues & he has steadily lost weight over the past 2 years.He cannot seem to absorb enough nutrients from his foods. He is on B-12 shots & prednisolone to help calm the inflammation & spure his appetite but sometimes the ONLY thing he will eat is this chicken baby food. He has also eaten the ham & turkey versions of this brand but lately...........just the chicken. He's fussy & has always been a  drama queen  & he also has allergies in the Autumn that affect his willingness to eat (if a cat can't smell the food a cat won"
1;My cat has kidney problems and has to take three pills twice a day.  It was undoable and gag-inducing until Pill Pockets.  Now he begs for them.  Astounding and miraculous!  Thank you for making these!
1;"""Getting pills down a labador is not always easy and it is amazing how they can actually eat an entire piece of cheese and still spit out a teeny tiny little pill!  The Schipperke is even smarter ...  With Pill Pockets we can actually say  time for your medicine  and they come running.  Buying these off the shelf (when you can find them) is far more expensive than amazon.com -- we buy in bulk and save a ton.  Not just on the Pill Pockets ... but on the cheese"
1;"""I love these things. My dog has arthritis and needs to take medication 3 times a day. Before I found these we had to push the pill to the back of her throat to get a pill down her. We had tried all the usual things that involved putting her pills into various types of food but she always managed to spit out the pills and get the food.<br />Now with Greenie Pill Pockets the pills go down 1st time every time and no one is traumatized"
1;"""Our dog now requires twice a day pills and the Greenies Pill Pockets are the easiest and most convient way to accomplish these tasks.  No more scrap of cheese or lunch meat.  Also like the fact that you can pull them apart into smaller  pockets  based on the need."""
1;"""We have two Siberian Huskies and the oldest has to take medication every night. She hates the way it smells and will dig it out of anything else we try to hide it in - even cake.  But these are amazing.  We just put the capsule inside"
1;I purchased 6 packages of Greenies pill pockets to donate to my local shelter. I selected the items off of the Amazon wish list.  I also had them delivered directly to the shelter. They arrived 2 days after I ordered them. Thanks
1;We own a boarding kennel and often have dogs that need a pill pocket to take their meds - some won't eat the beef flavor but are willing to take the chicken flavor.  Great way to convince a dog to take their medications!
1;"""We have two small housedogs that we dearly love. When we need to give them meds I just hated putting pills down their throats. It seemed to frighten both of them. We tried the pill pockets and were thrilled that they were thrilled. They consider it a treat. We use the chicken as it is easier on their stomachs. Amazon has a reasonable price"
1;"""I purchased the same bag from the vet for $10.  When my dog was diagnosed with Addison's disease I concludeded that I would need to use the pill pockets for the rest of his life.  Not only do they work"
1;"""I purchased pill pockets to give my dog antiseizure medicine.  The pockets are so yummy that our other dog comes by for pill time to get a bite too!<br />The pills are much bigger than needed to give a small pill"
1;This is the easiest way to give your dog medicine. My dog prefers the chicken treats and she comes running everyday to take her meds. Terrific idea and I am only sorry I didn't know about it years ago.
1;"""I was so relieved when I found this product. Our doberman was having serious skin allergies and had to take antibiotics and steroids in pill form. He was so crafty with the pills - we would hide them in wet dog food"
1;I have a english bull terrier with ALOT of skin problems so he takes medication and vitamins 2x per day and some of them are quite big and the zinc pills apparently taste extra bad so he has become very difficult to give pills and actually hides with he hears the bottles being opened and when you get him you have to pry his very large jaw open and hold it closed until he swallows because he'll spit it out. With pill pockets I even combine a few together and he LOVES it... he will even do his tricks to take his meds now and I'm not sure he even chews ha.. Its a little expensive but combining the pills together makes it last longer and it saves time and my fingers!
1;"""I've been using Pill Pockets for 4 years now. I dont know why the other person had such a problem with hers.......but sometimes a few of them come crumbled in the bag....so what. You just smoosh it around your pill and the dog gobbles it down.  Maybe your's got crushed by the post office. I dont know. All I know is that regardless of what it looks like out of the bag"
1;"""I have bought all of the various flavors of Caring Candies.  They are well made and look great.  Most of the candies are what I would call blander.  (I think Americans are used to more flavoring added to their candies).  But This licorice one is brimming with great licorice flavoring.  I know with sugar free candies you never know what you are going to get.  But if you like licorice"
1;I had never heard of Walker's biscuits before and I was really surprised how good they were.  The ginger cookies had pieces of ginger in them - delicious and the chocolate biscuits were different and tasted great.  The honey oat biscuits were also very good.  I would like to order them separately.
1;"""I bought these trays because I was originally using plastic ice cube trays and they kept breaking everytime I would take the food out. These trays work wonderful! They slide right out and are the perfect portion size! Love them! A little expensive"
1;This product is sturdy and well made.  The portion is perfect. It has a lid which keeps food clean and easy to stack. I have one in orange as well as green.  My baby is 11 months now.  I wish I would have purchased more in different colors but I got by with freezing and storing in freezer bags.  I think I can reuse Beaba freezer trays after I stop making baby food.
1;We recieved our first freezer tray as a gift and I loved them so much that I bought another! We also use the bpa free oxo ice cube trays when we want smaller cubes! Having the two sizes is very helpful!
1;"""We have 6 of these trays in various colors.  My husband and I both work and make our daughter's baby food instead of buying jars.  We make large batches on the weekends and having multiple trays allows us to make a variety of foods that we can then combine when defrosted during the week.  I love that they stack neatly in the freezer"
1;"""I have several types of baby food molds and this is my favorite. It is soft and rubbery so I am able to push up from the bottom of the mold to remove the food. I don't like having to run hot water over the back"
1;I have used this a couple times when making my own baby food and I love it.  It's really easy to freeze food in.  When the baby food is frozen you just run hot water on the back and pop out the food.  It washes up nicely in the dishwasher.  I think the ammount of food that it holds is good too.  I would highly recommend this product.
1;I received this freezer tray along with the Beaba foodmaker and spoons from my in-laws.  I am totally told on all Beaba products due to the high quality and great designs.  The food pops out easily and leaves no waste behind.
1;The Beaba freezer tray is flexible and very easy to clean. It has seven slots which is a good amount of storage for a week worth of 2oz puree portions. I make a lot of food for my 9 month old boy and I like to use this tray to store various fruit purees. The top closes securely and feels like it wouldn't come off if dropped.
1;"""I was just making my 7 month old son some brocolli baby food when I realized I hadn't written a review for the Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray.  I have two of them and I absolutely love them.  I make the baby food then freeze it.  If I have too much food and not enough tray space"
1;I could not be more thrilled with this product! It works perfectly - the large ice cubes slip right out! Zero order like some other product reportedly had! Because the ice cubes are very large they last a long time.<br /><br />These large ice cubes are so awesome that refrigerator designers will have to redesign so their refrigerators can make these!
1;"""This is a great item! I love the silicon material. It is so easy to wash and dry! I don't have any problem with this item. What you see is what you get. I am planning to use to make some ice cubes after my kid graduate from eating baby foods :) Yes"
1;"""I have been making my baby food since she was 6 months old.  These trays are fantastic and allow me to make large batches of baby food and freeze for reheating throughout the week.  I originally purchased two trays"
1;We have a friend that recommended this to us.  She makes her own baby food and freezes it in this tray for use later.  We will give it a whirl when our baby arrives.  It seems like a well made product.  It looks like it is good for BIG Jello-shots too!
1;Have started sprouting again and am enjoying these seeds.  I use them in my salads and sandwiches.  They add a good crunch and help with a flavor bite.  The amount of radish seeds seem to give the right spice to the mixture.
1;I love this mix. It's not too strong but you know it's in your juice. The germination rate is really high as well. I feel like I received an excellent buy for the money. I would come back again to purchase this product.
1;Good quality seeds......a pound goes a long way.<br />Nice combination of seeds.<br />This combination does have a flavor zing. I don't know if its a radish or broccoli seeds that add the spicy flavor.<br />Very tasty.
1;Broccoli and Friends arrived promptly.  It was packaged simply (plastic bag with some strong tape fastening the opening) which I expected from a discount product like this.  Of course a ziploc would have been nice but I prefer what they gave rather than having them raise the price for better packaging.<br /><br />I did not have lots of non-sprouters as others commented.  Almost all of my seeds sprouted very well and produced beautiful sprouts. I will definitely be buying this product again.
1;Love these sprouting seeds.  The mixture adds a tangy interest to the sprouts.<br />Great in salads and on sandwiches.  We live in a remote area with limited access to fresh produce.  These sprouting seeds add freshness to our sandwiches and salads.
1;"""I really  like this dental treat and my dogs love them.  They are wheat free which is great for my German short=hair pointer who is wheat intolerant.  Only problem is it is hard to find this product in my local pet stores and on line.  I even contacted the manufacturer"
1;"""Our cat absolutely loves these  green  treats.  Esp since she's indoors and unable to eat plants/grass they give her the greens she needs as part of her diet.  We've been giving them to her for years and have had no issue - We actually toss them down the hall to her to give her some exercise which she loves.  Just give them time to chew etc.  HIGHLY recommend!"""
1;"""Urbani is just known for  finding the best tuffles in the world and this olive oil infused with black truffles didn't disappoint at all.  I think the hard part with this is where and when to use it but we have found it great in eggs"
1;We have been waiting for Earl Grey Decaf and now it is here.  My wife love it.  She now can drink either Earl Grey or English Breakfast.  It gives her a choice.<br /><br />The Earl Grey is not as strong as the English Breakfast.
1;A distinctive decaf tea is hard to find.  I want a black tea taste but have rebuffed other decaf teas because they are flat and have weak flavors.  Early Grey decaffeniated has enough flavor and no flat taste residue.  I drink it at night to unwind and have no worries that I will be up all night!
1;"""Great price for a great tea.  To have the ability to enjoy my decaffeinated tea with the convenience of my Keurig is one of life's greatest pleasures.  Each cup is fresh with all the Bergamot I enjoy from a full brew.  Dont' be fooled by the decaf"
1;Wasn't sure I'd really care for this tea - as a k-cup option.  It's WONDERFUL! It's the perfect blend of tea and all you have to do is brew it in a minute. Add a touch of honey and sit and relax while the tea warms you up!
1;This has become my favorite seasoning. I try to cook without salt and this is an excellent substitute. It is not over-heavy with oregano as most greek spice mixtures are. I use it every day. I just ordered two more online to replenish my supply!
1;"""We use Cavender's Salt Free All Purpose Greek Seasoning for almost any food - from fried green tomatoes to cantaloupe.  We no longer are able to find the salt free (blue label) in the stores - only on the internet.  The yellow labeled product in supermarkets contains salt and is far less tasty.  I usually become very thirsty when eating food containing MSG"
1;"""I cook this product in soy milk. I add one packet in 1/2 cup of soy milk. It cooks in about 3 minutes. It tastes wonderful. It makes you feel full. It is low in calories. Everytime I feel hungry and I do not want to spoil my diet"
1;Just got these in today and opened up 2 of the packages to put them in the cookie jar. They were not any broken and they are delicious. So full of chocolate chips!!!! I recommend these to anyone to get. They came to me in a large box with other things I ordered and they were in great shape.
1;I usually hate the taste of prepackaged cookies but these were amazingly yummy. I got the chocolate lovers cookies and they were LOADED with chocolate chips and chunks. In my opinion these easily rivaled store bought unbaked cookie dough cookies once they've been baked and cooled when it came to taste and texture. I loved them and will be buying them on a regular basis.<br /><br />The Keebler elves really got their act together with these cookies. These are WAY better than Chips Ahoy by a long shot.
1;"""I used to buy Chips Ahoy! brand cookies at the store once in a while because they were my favorite cookie from childhood. It had been years since I even tried a Keebler brand cookie and one day I found them on sale. I found that Keebler Chips Deluxe originals are thicker"
1;I searched and searched for a tea that tastes like the tea I get at my favorite Japanese restaurant and I was so happy to discover this brand.  I have turned several friends onto it also.  What I also appreciate is how affordable it is.  Sip and enjoy!
1;This is my favorite tea. Regular green tea tastes a little bitter to me. The addition of the brown rice gives this tea a nice smokey flavor. In the winter I drink at least two cups a day...I can't get enough!
1;Ive been looking for this brown rice tea like forever! I just can't seem to find this in the groceries so i didn't hesitate getting one when i found out it was on amazon. thank goodness! it's so YUMMY! it feels like I'm in Japan
1;The Genmai Cha tea I purchased is quite wonderful.  It takes a few cups to get hooked on its delightful flavor but then it's terrific to start off a day with. I use honey and sometimes a bit of cream which adds to its richness.  I recommend it highly to tea enthusiasts.
1;"""I have found the flavor of numerous green teas to have an oily or fishy undertone. Not this tea!!  Genmai-cha tea has an amazing nutty/savory flavor.  Highly recommend this tea - I have found it to be an excellent tasting green tea.  With all of the potential benefits of green tea"
1;"""This is the greatest soda drink on the face of God's green Earth! I've been drinking Pepsi since I was just a little kid. Classic taste. Much better than that garbage called Coke. Anyone who never tasted Pepsi before... Go now and get one! If you have a store near you"
1;I was introduced to Hadiram's Khatta Meetha by my sister who lives in India. I really like it as a snack. It's sweet but with a little kick to it.  I've been buying the 7.06 oz five packs and freezing them until I use them.  Today I saw that it's available for a regularly scheduled subscription (at a discounted rate and with no shipping charges) and I am ecstatic.  This is just a great snack if you want something sweet with just a little bit of heat.
1;This is really good with a rich and intense lemon flavor. I did not want to use alone as much as I wanted to use for a base for a dressing or glaze (ala recipes seen on cooking channel). I am well satisfied.
1;"""I absolutely love this soup mix for my roast chicken.  It's the only way I'll roast a chicken.  I actually got the recipe out of my Lipton soup mix cookbook and it's as follows:<br /><br />Country Herb Roasted Chicken<br /><br />1 chicken (2 1/2 to 3 lb.)"
1;I am soon having bariatric surgery and have been trying many high protein supplements as I prepare for a new eating regimend.  This hot chocolate tastes great!  I would never guess that it is a protein product if someone gave it to me without my knowing what it is.
1;I doubt this is something you are going to routinely fix at home (unless your a no-cook bachelor).  This is however tastey and great to keep in the desk drawer for those busy days when you can't break for lunch (Or forgot it like I do).
1;I love this soup. I have it for lunch & it's helped me lose weight. Just keep it covered and heating ay least 5 extra minutes than it says on package directions or the pasta & carrots won't be cooked enough.
1;I love this soup but like alot of these Dr. McDougall's soups you have to watch them when cooking and cut time off the full and 20% power.I also recondmend you let it sit for 5 minutes to soften beans up before cooking or after cooking with a 30 second 50% power after the soften time for heat.
1;"""I like to try new things and we have a British store nearby call the Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. The other day when I was there I picked up a liter bottle of Robinson's Apple and Blackcurrant Fruit Drink imported from England. It's a concentrate and has no added sugar. You use one part of the concentrated drink with four parts of water. For the water"
1;This is the second time I have ordered this tea. It has a wonderful flavor and very smooth.<br />I drink two cups every morning instead of coffee now. I was drawn to this product because<br />of Dr. OZ.
1;These are hard to find flavor..My husband loves these....rec'd order fast & product was perfect....2nd time ordering and will continue ...My husband eats these like candy....don't know if thats good or bad... but I do know he loves them and his breath always smells great !
1;1) Does not have that harsh tic-tac minty sensation that numbs your mouth.<br />2) The red ones taste like cherries.<br />3) The yellow ones taste like passion fruit.<br /><br />This product freshens a person's breath and is very pleasant to suck on. And they taste so good it is easy to finish a pack of them without realizing it. So it makes sense to buy a box of 12. This lasts me about 1-2 months. Your mileage may vary!
1;I was introduced to Taj Mahal by an Indian women who used it as the base for a wonderfully flavored chai using mostly ginger and cardamom.  I have been a fan ever since.  It is strong - only for strong black tea drinkers.
1;"""these pork rinds are a great value plus they are fun to watch them puff up from a small piece to a giant puffy tasty pork rind! I also like the fact you can make as much as you like.I like to make small batches so I can eat them when they are still warm.So easy to make"
1;These pellets really popped well.  I've tried three different brands of pork rinds. These seem to fluff the best in the shortest time with the least salt taste.  I'm sorry I only bought one bag to try them but I will have to get more.
1;I have had the pre-packaged type of microwavable pork rinds before and thought they were pretty good. I logged on and when I saw these I thought I would give them a try. I like these even better because I can control my portion size. Everyone that I have offered them to has been impressed. They are really good when you add the hot sauce or salsa of your choice after they cook. Excellent!
1;"""The package arrived on time and in good condition. It's deceptive because a 1 lb. bag of uncooked pork rinds is considerably smaller than a bag of cooked pork rinds from the store. But this bag goes a long way. These nuggets are great! I've had the microwave pork rinds in a bag and these are far superior. Cooking a few or a lot is an easy task. They really cook up nice and tender. The first time I cooked these I thought the ends were burning so I stopped the microwave. Actually"
1;"""Just purchased one on vacation and it works as I imagined with either block or crumbled blue cheese. Just stab the blue as it sits in the container several times until the barrel is full (thats what the slit in the side is for"
1;This was such a great find!<br /><br />I am working on a gluten free diet at home and several recipes call for rice flour. It can be hard to find where I live.<br /><br />I was excited to see Amazon had it for a great price!<br /><br />It arrived promptly and in great condition.<br /><br />I have used it in recipes that call for it and it is delicious!<br /><br />This is the most well-known brand (I am told) and it really is great.<br /><br />A must have for anyone wanting to be gluten free!
1;This was the least expensive of the sweet rice flours on Amazon.  I use sweet rice flour in most of my gluten free recipes...combined with various other ingredients as a regular wheat flour substitute.  I consider this a necessary ingredient to help things hold together.
1;"""Don't care for creamy cappuccinos.  And you won't find me sipping a double mocha cinnamon latte that costs half a paycheck.  As far as I'm concerned espressos are for those shoppers with ten items or less.  Just pour me a cup of rich"
1;"""I was in a local supermarket one day when I noticed several ladies flocking into the coffee aisle and throwing eight or nine canisters at a time of Folgers Classic Roast coffee into their shopping carts! As it turns out"
1;"""I am currently deployed so getting good coffe like we can easily access back at home isn't always readily available. But this canister has still lasted us quite a bit and everyone loves the taste. and considering our location"
1;I drink a lot of this stuff and Folgers Classic is my choice.  Have no use for all the other flavors or instant or that thick glue they sell at StarBucks.<br />I prefer (real coffee) and this is what I prefer.<br />It's the only thing I serve in my machine shop.  Nobody complains and we go thru a lot of this stuff so they must like it.
1;"""This is not the same old tomato based hot sauce. It is an imaginative take on a spice sauce that works well on just about anything from hamburgers and barbecue to beans and rice. It's not available at the grocer where I live - but it's coming soon! So"
1;My 2 month old kitten loves this! I bought this to introduce her to canned food as I found nothing but dry food at my local store for kittens. I was excited to bring this home and have her try it. It was love at first taste...she gobbled it right up!
1;"""I bought these to share with the office and the disappeared almost instantly.  They are very good and contain enough protein to keep people going while suppressing that  snacky  feeling.  These are a great snack to carry with you as they are very light (for example"
1;I was a bit apprehensive ordering these from Amazon because I had read in other reviews that some of the jerky were moldy. I am happy to say that mine were absolutely mold-free! My family vanquished 2 packets on the spot LOL...
1;I find that the buffalo chicken jerky is great for when I'm craving buffalo wings late at night. Sure they're not the saucy goodness of wings at a bar but they definitely replicate the flavor. They are very hot but delicious.
1;"""These are a great go-to snack/meal when you're in a rush and don't want chips or hotdogs.<br /><br />The nuggets are about the size of a stack of three quarters with some smaller ones the size of a couple of nickels.<br /><br />The flavor is spicy with a nice tang.<br /><br />The texture is softer than jerky but not as soft as say summer sausage.<br /><br />Quick comment on quantity - there are three servings"
1;I love the Beef Teriyaki Nuggets and the Buffalo Chicken Nuggets. Now I have a 3rd kind to eat. These are great tasting and easy to eat (important for post bariatric surgery people). I love Jack Link's Nuggets line!
1;"""I have ordered Hawaiian Shaved Ice 10 pint pack for $44 and this time around decided to try Great Northern Polar's 10 pint pack for $29 (both have free Super Saver Shipping).  I was pleasantly surprised and happy with my Great Northern purchases upon testing.  The ten flavors all taste very delicious and I prefer the texture of the shaved ice when G N P's syrup is poured on"
1;I had recently bought an Hawaiian Ice Machine from Great Northern which we love.  The kids loved the flavors and the added cones and straws are an added bonus.  A little pricey but delivered to your door and ready to go.
1;I love this coffee and the price is remarkable for a gourmet product. I have bought from other high-end coffee dealers and spent an arm and a leg and waited a lot longer to receive it. Very quick delivery. Excellent price and product. Can't wait to try the next flavor.
1;Each filter pack is perfect for brewing 4 cups of coffee. This is that great Maxwell House flavor from filter packs that are incredibly easy to use. My coffee making skills are very limited and I get compliments on my coffee now! Highly recommended
1;Maxwell House has a winner with these filter packs. I leave home every morning before 5:00 AM and I always make one half a pot with one filter pack every morning when I get up because I need my coffee for the road. It is convenient and I prefer fresh brewed to the coffee bags that Maxwell House also makes.
1;"""I received one 10-Ounce packet of Lamb and Barley dog treats from the Vine program. The treats are fairly large but they are creased and can easily be broken into two treats. My Dobie is a big boy and eating the treat unbroken is his preference. Actually"
1;"""These treats are great for those who are particular about what they feed their dog.  We do a wheat/corn free diet and have tried other treats from the Newman's Own line.  Our dog (a 70lb Lab/Shepherd rescue) has loved them all"
1;"""This is a dog treat you can feel good about giving your animals. It has a nice shape...they come in two attached squares but you can break them apart for smaller treats.  They have an unoffensive smell..in fact they smell pretty good for doggie treats.  They are made of a good"
1;"""Confession time. I haven't personally tasted Newman's Own Organics new dog treats but they smell way yummier than most dog treats. (My dog Sheila has tasted them and she quickly started groveling for more. It was pathetic.) Seriously"
1;"""I ordered these for a friend who has a chow/golden retriever mix.  This dog is about the same size as a typical golden retriever.  He LOVES these treats.  Absolutely loves them.  I've never seen so much tail-waggin'!<br /><br />It's great to know that treats don't have to be junk food.  Just look at the ingredients in these and you'll see that they're probably healthier than most of the  people food  we eat."""
1;"""My dog really enjoyed these snacks.  She has Kidney problems so I am warry of giving her any old treats.  I trust the Newman brand and have faith that they don't put fillers (such as wood chips or other low quality ingredients) into their products.  Let's face it"
1;My dog is not a picky eater.  If this treat tasted like cat poo he would eat it.  with relish.  What I like is that it is not a big dog biscuit.  My husband tends to feed Jack snacks between meals and because he is a bigger dog he usually gets bigger treats.  This treat is less than 1/2 the size of his usual biscuit and he does not notice he is getting less. I am hoping this will take off some chunkage around his middle.
1;"""<span class= tiny > Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>What I loved most about these dog treats:<br />1. No greasy residue on my hands<br />2. No fowl smell<br />3. They are organic<br />4. My dog loved them<br />5. My cat even loved them<br /><br />6. One last thought...they are very hard treats. When you own a Beagle"
1;"""Newman's Own is a quality company that manufactures quality pet products.  I was surprised that my dog did not care for these treats.  I purposely researched these treats online and they do not lack in quality.  Just because my dog did not care for these"
1;"""Yes....Gracie really rushes into the living room to enjoy one of these treats in peace.  Any time she thinks something is really special...off she gos.  The treats are big enough that I break one into two pieces for a mini-dachshund.  She thinks she's eating candy and I know she's eating a treat that is full of healthy"
1;"""Tried these on our two Schnauzers----they were impressed!  These are rather large biscuits that are made to break in half which makes them a perfect size for a snack or reward.  They have a good crunch which I think is good for dental health.  Anyway"
1;These are a hit with my two Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.<br />These are nutritious snacks by the one and only Newman's Own company.<br />I've been a Newman's fan ever since I've got hooked their tasty pasta sauce (I love Sockarooni the most).<br />My dogs love these and I'm sure yors will too! Very Recommended.
1;"""These look like regular ole dog biscuits. They don't have a strong smell so you can hold these and the smell will not stay on you hands for a while like other treats. You can put these in your pocket and not worry about crumbling or smell in your pocket if you are taking your dog for a walk. We have a rottweiler and he eats anything you put in front of his face. What's great about these is that they are a lot better and healthier than other treats. Like others have said these are pretty hard. I tried breaking some that are stuck in half and it is pretty hard to do. So"
1;"""Let me tell you that I was totally impressed with the ingredient list on these treats.  The first thing I always do is check out the crude fat content and the ingredients to see how good this will be for my baby.  I have a Toy Fox Terrier and the last thing I want to give her is something that might cause her to get sick.  These cookies are quite big so you will need break them up and they are a bit on the hard side but Max loves them.  Just in case you don't know"
1;"""My dog really likes these treats.  They come in a domino-like biscuit that can be broken into two pieces that are roughly 1  square.  I found it interesting that these appear to be hand-cut as the biscuits are not all exactly the same size.  They look like a fig newton but with a scoring in the middle.<br /><br />These are very hard treats.  My dog is 5 months and is just getting her permanent teeth and I was worried that they might be too hard"
1;My dog loved these treats and I could feed it to him knowing they were good for him.  I trust Newman's Own to have exactly what they say on the package ingredients and to be wholesome.  They are scored so that you can break them in two if you want to.  They are easy to transport on a walk.
1;"""Much of the junk sold as dog food is made of filler and animal by-products and mysterious stuff with long scientific names.  How refreshing to have a simple organic dog biscuit made from good organic stuff that you can actually pronounce.  My dogs love these biscuits and eagerly offered a  sit  before I had a chance to fully open the package.  Lamb and rice"
1;"""There's such a range with dog treats - you can find those fake bacon treats that are filled with chemicals and then you can find these treats that contain only organic ingredients - no strange chemicals that you can't pronounce. If you want to give your dog healthy organic treats that they'll like"
1;"""My wife and I usually try to give our two dogs the best food and the best treats which is why we generally feed them Wellness products or really anything from the Old Mother Hubbard family of products.  We have always given them the Wellness dog biscuits and they have been wonderful.  However the only pain of the Wellness biscuits is that we usually have to go to the pet store specifically to get them as they are not available in our regular grocery store.  I know"
1;"""These truly are a superior dog treat. I have two small dogs and they are spoiled and picky when it comes to treats. They love these. Newman's Own brand is so much better than the bland dog treats that my poor dogs have always been subjected to in the past. These are high quality"
1;"""I am pretty particular about what I give my dog for treats. She has always had a funny tummy. If she gets something not right with her she vomits and gets some digestive issues going. My sister has long been a fan of these treats so I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />After giving my dog one treat a day for a couple of days they seemed to agree with her stomach and she moved up to a couple a day. She responded well to them so they get the thumbs up there. She is also fairly motivated do things for them as well.<br /><br />They don't have any odd odor and there isn't any residue left in my pocket from carrying them around for awhile when she is out and about with me.<br /><br />Overall"
1;"""I've got an out of shape Jack Russell and a diabetic chihuahua.  They are definite chow hounds but are a bit spoiled when it comes to treats -- they have developed discriminating palates.<br /><br />I watched closely when introducing them to these Newman's Own Organics Lamb/Barley Ranch Style.  They were a little puzzled at first . . . . The texture of these treats is extremely hard and crunchy and they are in an irregular square shape and have a rather  handcrafted  appearance.  The chemical free nature of these and the  hard texture have obvious health benefits.  The taste test? . . . . .<br /><br />In short"
1;What can I say about man's best friend other than he deserves the best treats possible.  It was almost as if our dog Shultz knew what was in the box and sat up begging for a treat when we opened the bag.<br /><br />The treats do seem a bit hard but our Doxie just loved them.  It's nice to be able to give a healthy organic treat instead of chemically processed treats.  Your pet will not be disappointed when you hand out these little square snacks.
1;I really did not think my picky a** dogs would eat them. I tossed the treats to them and waited for the sniff of dis approval. Waiting...waiting.. chomp chomp and they are gone to another room to enjoy the treat in peace. Two dogs give them a paws up.
1;okay how to review dog treats?  Of course my dog went crazy for these and my dog is the judge of what taste good to her.  For me I am concerned with what is good for her.  Based on the label the contents are organic and the ingredients are healthy so human is happy with this product.  Also newman contributes a portion to charity so everybody is happy!
1;"""I must admit that I don't have dogs that I would consider  pickY  but they did really loved these dog treats.  My dogs are small--a mini-pin and a dachsund--and they both immediately jumped on them as soon as they were served...no hesitation that I sometimes see if they get a new food.  Yes"
1;"""Here are dog treats you can trust! There are a lot of treats for the dog owner to select from but some of them are a bit scary. Here is a product that you can count on as being safe for your beloved pet. I found it to be safe and nutritious and my dogs found them to be delicious! This size is best for the smaller dogs. My Jack Russelss and Italian Greyhound found them just right but my pound Pup and Bassets would have enjoyed something larger. Still"
1;"""An Amazon Vines review of the Newman's New Zealand Lamb and Barley Organic dog treats. The product arrived timely and well packaged. I received one 10oz. re-sealable pouch.  Newman's states that the product is organic"
1;"""These contain all organic ingredients and the doggies gobbled them up.  What more can you say about a dog treat?  One of my dogs is a little fussy and sometimes turns her nose up at other treats but had no problem inhaling these and asking for more.  Do the math and decide if organic dog treats are worth the extra cash"
1;So I'm not going to taste these myself so I'll just have to rely on the enthusiastic reception by my wheaten terrier. Obviously the big draw here is the quality ingredients and assurance of the brand. I probably am more willing to spend on quality brand food for my dog than I am for me. I try to avoid Chinese food products since they have regulatory issues. No need to rehash the whole pet food scandal. That said it's easy to but junk American pet food too so I try to shop carefully. This seems to be a quality dog snack that the dog enjoys...
1;"""My wife and I wanted to get a gift basket like this for her father for Christmas.  We weren't going to be able to visit in person this year and enjoy Christmas morning breakfast and thought a gift basket would be nice.  After researching tons of options I became frustrated that so often the shipping on products like this cost more than the actual products themselves.  Let's face it"
1;I love Chunky candy bars-they remind me of being a kid and sharing them with my dad!  When this package arrived the outer card board box was sealed but the actual silver box of candy was not. The box was missing 3 candy bars not a big deal when you have ordered 24 except I now wonder  what other tampering could have been done.  I would go with a seller directly and not try to save by using Amazon Prime for this one!
1;"""Being new at Korean cooking several recipes I intend to cook calls for dried seaweed.  The seaweed that I saw on Korean cooking TV shows was thin in texture.  I was so lucky that the Welpac Dashi Kombu Dried Seaweed I purchased on Amazon was the right kind of seaweed.<br /><br />It is great"
1;"""These are the first Gluten Free crackers I found that actually taste like crackers! I don't mean they remind me of  real  crackers but that they are really excellent GF or not. The cost at our local hippie-health-food store is about twice what Amazon sells them for so I'm ordering a case or two. These are plain flavored and good with cheese. Great comfort food!"""
1;These are by far the best GF cracker on the market. They are crispie and hold up nicely when toppings are added. My 10 year old son really likes them and he is a fussy eater! We have not been able to find a decent GF bread for sandwiches so these crackers and a couple of thick pieces of GF Boar's Head ham and he's a happy camper.
1;"""My school age GF son loves these crackers. He says they taste the closest to the old crackers he used to be able to eat. We started making  lunchables  for him one day by adding a slice of lunch meat and cheese and he loved it. He now takes  lunchables  to school once or twice a week using these crackers.<br /><br />On their own these crackers aren't bad"
1;"""We have been a gluten free family for 17 years.  At first the GF products available in our local store in no way resembled the foods we were comfortable with.  If it was a baked good I baked it at home"
1;"""My daughter loves these crackers with some peanut butter on them. They do come in two small packages inside the box. These crackers are good for poeple who can't eat wheat or gluten but not if you have other allergies. This product does contain soy"
1;I have been looking for a cracker that kind of passes off as a saltine cracker. My Mom's recipes require saltine crackers and so having celiac disease I have gone without! Now I can enjoy some of the recipes that I have grown up with. They also are good for snacking crackers. I thought they tasted like a cross between saltines and ritz. My husband went with a kinda grahm crackery taste. They are the first gluten free cracker I have found that are not so crispy they crack in pieces!!
1;"""My son has been gluten free for at least 10 years and the products that are available to a gluten-free diet have grown tremendously.  There was nothing much available 10 years ago.  The crackers and bread usually crumbled if you just looked at them!  They were mainly made out of rice flour and rice flour is not good for main ingredient in making breads"
1;"""These crackers are the closest thing to the  real thing  I could find. No they do not even hold a candle to Ritz crackers & can sometimes be brittle (we expect that with Gluten Free foods) but they get the job done. I eat mine with peanut butter alot for a light snack. I give them 5 stars (the original)"
1;I've been gluten-free for 4 months and was dying for some cheese and crackers.  These are amazing!!! I had them on vacation with some friends who aren't eating gluten-free and they still loved these crackers.  I'm going to order a few cases of these and stock up!
1;I love these crackers and even serve them to non Gluten Free eaters with great success.  The multi-grain crackers have fennel seeds in them so if you don't like the taste of fennel be sure you get one of the other two flavors.  The original flavor tastes like a cross between a saltine and a ritz cracker and those were my two favorite crackers before I found out I couldn't have gluten.
1;"""I was a little hesitant to try these because I tried another glutino product & hated it. I bought one box of these in one of the local stores to try it & they were great. In fact the last two days I've had little cracker sandwiches for lunch. They're not as good as saltines or ritz but honestly when you pile all the goodies on them you can't really tell. I also tried the suggestion on the box of putting a slice of banana"
1;I couldn't believe it the first time i tried Glutino crackers.  It actually tastes like a RITZ cracker.  No flaxseed or pine-nut flavors to overpower what you put on the cracker.  It's just a great cracker with just the right flavor for snacking!  I love this product!!!
1;"""One my standards for judging a gluten free item is that I can serve it at a party and my gluten-eating guests enjoy it.  These crackers reach that standard.  I have served these crackers several times to a gluten-eating crowd and there has always been at least one guest who unsuspectingly eats them"
1;"""We have been looking for a cracker for our daughter whom we have just put on the GFCF diet. The Glutino cracker is about as close to a  normal  cracker that we have come across. The rest of us who are not on the diet even think these are good. They have a yummy buttery and salty taste to them. We bought them here on amazon.com in a case of 6 boxes for $24. Very reasonable. Highly recommend to anyone on the GFCF diet who misses their crackers. Makes a nice snack to pack in the car for road trips or flights."""
1;Received package and was just as I wanted plus!  I enjoyed getting a piece of the candy from the box.  It arrived on time and I am ordering another box!  Just wish shipping was not so high but is not their fault.
1;I bought the Med size for my Mini Dachshund to keep her happy when i go out for a few hours and she is in her crate. I know she loves somthing when she does the little dance and bolts to her crate waiting for the nutrident. Other chew leave gooey messes on the carpet and come apart easily however this one i have never found any evidence that she ever even had one. Highly recomend the vet says her teeth are in tip top shape because she gets one a day
1;"""Our Schnauzer has some really horrible breath and we don't know exactly why. I tried several of the  dental dog chews  testing to qualify their claims. All failed my test. I saw these at Wal-Mart and decided to give them a try. SUCCESS! Honestly"
1;"""I was happy to fine a product that is easily digestible by dogs. too many products out there can cause internal problems and even death to you pet if you are not careful.<br /><br />Bill Drews<br /><br />Hot springs"
1;"""My dogs love these chews. I have 5 dogs - all various sizes and temperments. I have found they are similar to Greenies but much less expensive. In addition you can often find coupons and sales on these. It is so good for their teeth to let them chew"
1;I buy the medium treats for my 19 lb Long Hair Chihuahua mix and he loves these! They are pricey but cheaper than what you will find at the store or Pet store. He gets one every other day...it actually helps his digestion in my opinion. If you get them on Subscription they are even cheaper.
1;Making coffee is such a ritual and having these handy creamers in the pantry makes for a very nice treat when it's time for a hot cup of coffee.  They are also kept in the breakroom and since they do not have to be refrigerated they make for a very nice option for our clients.  Great value too since we can purchase such a large number of cups at one time.  Very handy on the road too.  Toss a few in a briefcase or in the car and have them if you are on the road and want to flavor your coffee when on the road.
1;This was exactly what I was looking for so that I don't have to use up fridge space for my coffee condiments.  They all came to me with no damage what-so-ever.  Not a single one that I have seen yet has been broken.
1;We like this coffee creamer and have been using it for years. So our main concern with ordering it was would any of the individual containers break. We received the item with none of the containers broken. So for the cost this is a great buy.
1;I read a lot of reviews about creamers bursting during shipping. I went ahead and took a chance on this purchase anyway and I was surprised. They have changed their packaging since some of these reviews. They no longer arrive loose and now have padding. My creamers arrived in perfect condition. Not one broken one. This is such a great deal! International delight is the best creamer. Nice flavor and creamy! Definitely worth the buy!
1;I have ordered this product on a monthly basis. I love that it comes to my home.  I have read other reviews and have read that they recieve them damaged. I have to tell you mine come in perfect order. I hope for those of you who order this product the same results.
1;The product does come in one bag then boxed. I was fortunate that I did not have any come open in transit. Also I am loving the fact that they do not have to be refrigerated (so I can keep them at work).
1;"""I drink a lot of coffee and refuse to drink without creamer. This subscribe and save service has been a blessing for me. I can now always have creamer ready for me in my fridge at a much cheaper price. I am now on my 3rd delivery. Several other reviewers said that some of theirs busted and leaked and make a mess. When I first got mine I had about 6 of them that were leaked on me. But on the 2nd and 3rd box"
1;"""I order the 192 box of these every month.  I'll get them the same time of the month for a couple of months and then they send me an email that they have canceled my order due to payment problem and I have to reorder and loose a month.  I don't understand since I havent changed my address"
1;"""I am a person who has NEVER drank tea.  I've tried many different teas and have never liked any.  I also have moderate stomach issues so thought I'd try this tea.  I will admit it took me a couple cups of tea to get hooked"
1;I have had alot of stomach problems over many years and this is an excellent tea for settling my stomach quickly. It also works great if you have overeaten and feel uncomfortable - so good I buy it by the case!
1;"""This is one of the most amazing things in the world for people who suffer from stomach problems.  The name Stomach Ease is really right on the money because it quickly eases stomach discomfort.<br /><br />The ingredients are a little intimadating for sure!  I'm not a fan of black licorice at all"
1;"""I have had mystery stomach issues since my early teens (I'm 43). Nothing has helped.  Then I tried this tea.  I was already a Yogi Tea fan.  Just one cup of this when I have stomach  issues  and they just go away in a matter of about 30 minutes.  Love it."""
1;I recently discovered this tea as I had developed Leaky Gut Syndrome and just saw it on the shelves at Whole Foods.  I can't believe how fast it worked!  I would say within 15 minutes I was feeling wonderful.  And this morning at 4am I awoke with the worst cramping so I immediately made a cup and within half an hour I was fine.  This stuff is a miracle I tell you!
1;For almost 20 years I have relied on Yoga Stomach Ease tea to ease stomach stress and bloating.  I live overseas and have to order it sent to a USA address and then forwarded to me here in Israel.  It is worth the trouble and extra cost shipping.  I am alway amazed how quickly I feel better after one cup.  Thanks Yoga.  Chia Sorkowitz
1;"""This tea seemed to really help my stomach issues.  I have fibromyalgia and I started to have symptoms of IBS just recently.  I also had terrible acid reflux.  I do not know how much this tea helped the acid reflux.  It does seem greatly reduced.  The IBS symptoms are gone completely.  It could all be a coincidence"
1;"""A Alright With This Tea Loosen Your Stomach Muscles With a Cup of this Awesome Tea YOGI STOMACH EASE.<br />Thanks For Your Helping Hand to Convenience Me.<br />Recommended for the rehabilitating person of any strenuous activity on abs.<br />Recipes that really work on your stomach to bring to relief feeling"
1;This is my favorite tea and I have tried dozens of different flavors and brands.  I have a sensitive stomach and sometimes this tea soothes my stomach.  It's cheaper ordering it from Amazon than buying it from my local supermarket.
1;This is some of the very best raw goat's milk cheese on the market.  It has a mild cheddar flavor which is different from the often very strong taste of other goat cheeses.  This mildness makes it very suitable for cooking and baking as well.  I definitely recommend it.  It is tasty and since it is made of raw milk it is very healthy too.
1;Cats have many things that pass through their mouths causing tartar buildup and eventual decay of teeth. Just like with people they need a little help with their dental hygiene. These tidbits - shaped like litte fish - are a tasty and effective solution. Difficulty is ignoring the crys for more.
1;My order is a repeat order as we have enjoyed this coffee for a long time.  The price offered at Amazon is good and the delivery is very quick.  I do recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a good cup of coffee each morning and at coffee-break time.  MLF
1;"""I just received a box of 50 of the Deidrich french Roast. Upon opening the box I saw coffee grinds meaning some kcups broke open.<br /><br />I made a quick call to amzn. Not so upset at losing a few kcups...stuff happens. More upset at the time it would require to wipe the grinds off of each kcup and then find and throw away the damaged ones.<br /><br />AMZN very promptly gave me a full refund and since it was a 'Grocery Item'"
1;"""I ran across this coffee when looking for a dark and 'bold' coffee.  I've always called that  a good strong cup of coffee .<br />This coffee meets my criteria for that.  It is not bitter and doesn't leave a bad coffee taste in your mouth.<br /><br />I'm a tightwad so the $.55/Kcup appealed to me also.  Sometimes I add a teaspoon of my favorite instant and rotate the Kcup 180 deg. and run it through again.  This gives me a second good cup of coffee at reduced prices.:)<br /><br />I will buy more of the Big Easy Bold."""
1;If you like dark coffee this is a good one. I tried a sample with my new Keurig and<br />fell in love with this coffee.<br />I found the best price through Amazon.<br />My order came quickly and will order again from this company.
1;This item shipped quickly. I love this K-Kup.Strong coffee taste and aroma.<br />Greate for my morning commute.<br />One of only three extra bold types I drink.<br /><br />Adiitonal UPDATED Review:  ORDER # 2 Update (April 26th 2012)<br /><br />Price went down a few cents but added approx.$6.00 shipping!!??<br />Cheeper to buy Extra bold K-Kups from Dunkin Donut store ( better than Emerils anyway! )<br />My Last order from this place...................
1;"""I have been grinding my own coffee and putting it into a DIY k-cup. I tried several of the  bold  pre-packaged k-cups (I use these when I am in a hurry.) None of them matched up to my own grind until I ran across these. Emeril's Big Easy Bold is the first I have found that make me want to brew them instead of my own grind. Excellent!"""
1;All I can say is BAM! The flavor and the buzz is totally Emeril. I drink enormous amounts of coffee daily (trucker) and this is by far the best I've tried in a quick K cup format. The cups work fine (no grounds) and the price is right.
1;I usually don't like brownie mixes at all and won't buy them.  We bought this product to take to a picnic since we were certain there would be no gluten free desserts there for my kids.  I was surprised at how good these brownies tasted!  These were the best brownies I've ever had (other than homemade brownies that have gluten in them).
1;This is one of the best gluten-free brownies that are just as good as or even better than the brownies that are made from wheat. Excellent treat for people who cannot tolerance gluten. A must buy for the gluten sensitive person
1;"""Several decadent ones. And all the recipes are on each bag. Rave reviews from all my non-celiac friends. Excellent case price from Amazon versus any store (Whole Foods/Sprouts/Market Street/Central Market) where I can purchase in North Central Texas. An also outstanding alternative (if you want less decadent"
1;I bought these in our supermarket on a whim one day.  I love them.  I have had digestive issues since childhood.  These taste great.  They dont make me feel sick.  I can have my cookie fix without feeling compelled to eat all of them.  My supermarket stopped carrying them so I bought the six pack.  I make them about once a month so the mixes will be used long before they expire.
1;This product is great for not only brownies but also cake. I used the recipe on the side for decadent cake and everyone loved it. People didn't know it was gluten/casein free at all. Was flavorful and moist. I ran out of vanilla almond milk so I used chocolate almond milk. It made it more chocolatey.<br />For a gluten/casein free chocoholic it was a wonderful treat.
1;"""My son has autism and is on the GFCF diet.  He loves this mix made into cookies.  I remove the chocolate chunks ( trying to keep them as low in sugar as possible)  and I add 8 tspns benefiber and 1/4 cup baby rice cereal to boost the nutrition.  Then I add 1/4 cup flax oil and 1/4 cup olive oil and bake on a pizza stone - they never burn on the pizza stone - might burn if cooked on conventional bakeware.  My son love these and he is a very very picky eater.  The brownies that this mix makes are fabulous"
1;"""My 3-yr old daughter just got diagnosed with Celiac's. We're experimenting now finding the right products to substitute what we like that taste the best. This is the best brownie mix! I like it better than Bob's Red Mill brownie mix (which I thought was good too"
1;"""Another home-run from the people at Pamela's Bakery!  My family loves this brownie mix.  I make these brownies at least once a week.  I've made them for dessert and no one guesses that they're gluten-free.  We make the  fudgy  version and it really is just too good for words.  Nice chocolate chunks"
1;These gluten-free brownies match up with Ghiardhelli's Triple Chunk Brownie Mix.  I add chocolate chips to give them a little twist.  My whole family enjoys these.  This is the best gluten-free dessert I've found.
1;"""I switched to this food to try and eliminate food allergies.  After spending hundreds of dollars at the vet for my dog who wouldn't stop licking his paws raw.  Within 3 weeks he stopped licking and his hair stopped falling out.  I also mixed this dry food with EVO 95% venison in a can. I took about a week to slowly switch over to the new food. So now his only protein was venison and all grain free. The food is expenspensive but cheaper than weekly vet visits and giving him steroids/sprays/baths.  Make sure you don't give your dog anything else like rawhides"
1;My dogs really love this item.  They are hard to find.  One of my dogs enjoys eating just the chicken jerky off the stick.  The other gladly finishes eating her and his unwanted portion too.  A nice treat for them.
1;"""I was so happy to find this food on Amazon.com. I love this food for my cat. It keeps his teeth fresh and makes his breath smell better. It's a little pricey but well worth the price because I find that it's healthy for my cat"
1;I don't know if I love the jokes or the candy the best.  Both have made me a hit with my great grandson Caleb.  Captain Caleb and I sitting on the couch watching Doctor Who and eating laffy taffy..what a great treat.
1;We had the Lava cake last night and it was wonderful.  The chocolate flowed out of the cake as pictured!  And so easy to prepare.  The ramekins that came in the kit are a great little dish to have for other desserts too!
1;Every year I look forward to when these bad boys come out. The peanut butter to chocolate ratio is perfection! Perfect size for sharing (although I have a hard time with that) I usually cut into sections and eat over a period of a few days.
1;"""My little boy is nearly two and has become an extremely picky eater.  The peas and carrots he used to love just get thrown on the floor and the little chunks of squash I give him - he spits them out and makes himself gag!  So"
1;I bought this for the first time on Amazon a few weeks ago--the variety package and it was great (5 Stars)--powder was fresh and vibrant looking. Ran out of the peas--so thought I'd purchase it again--but without the variety pack--just the peas. This time--got a package that expires in May and the packaging was a bit different--which was fine--since it's only end of March right now--but when I opened it--the powder was stale looking (like sand)--whitish in color not the vibrant green and powder flew up in the air (like sawdust)--whereas it's usually more dense.  Too bad--my baby really liked the peas in the variety pack.
1;The peas are a BRIGHT fresh looking green color not anything like a store bought peas would be. My son loves all of the flavors. The apples do get clumpy and kind of hard so it's a little harder to mix those up the the other flavors. Over all I LOVE these.
1;"""Rooibos Natural Red tea is something of a personal taste! It has an interesting flavor as all things that are good for you do! I prefer to add a little cinnamon to mine. It is known to be used for people who get GOUT and since I do "
1;"""I order Folger's Black Silk coffee for our office.  The staff here like a bold coffee without the bite of some of the  coffee shop  coffees.  Black Silk gives them what they want while still being mindful of cost.  I priced out coffees by the ounce and found that this coffee is a great value when I buy it by the 6-pack -- even compared to the larger sized canisters that we were buying in the supermarket.  All in all"
1;My Mom has a hard time always getting this dark roast and its great that I can ship it to her through Amazon and it's there in days for her to use.  I have no idea how much she has been paying but it great just to surprise with several jars of the Black Silk when she can't find it when she's grocery shopping.
1;The coffee itself is quite dark and rich. What's even greater is the good price. It's a little cheaper (if you compare price per ounce) than you could even get at Walmart with their large size can of the same coffee. The fact Amazon sells the small cans in a pack of six is an added bonus because the coffee stays fresh longer.
1;"""My friend sent this to me and now I use it for everything! It has the texture of real cake!!!!!!!! No longer feeling deprived.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HYW5JO >The Pure Pantry Baking Mix"
1;All of The Pure Pantry mixes are fabulous.  Gluten free doesn't mean taste free!  This baking mix allows me to make all kinds of breads and muffins I can also use it as flour when I roll out dough.  I only buy Pure Pantry mixes now.
1;We use the buddy fruits as a quick add-on-item to kid's and adult's bagged lunches at our house.  No one ever brings one back home--we consider that a victory in the kid's lunch boxes.  Greal low calorie count and much better than a cookie for dessert. Check out our blog at [...]
1;I love the 100 calorie packs. They limit my intake so I don't eat a huge bag. Bring them to lunch with me to get a good amount of protein. I like how they are smaller bite size pieces of jerky. It makes it easier to eat and not so gamey. They are delicious too! A little pricey though.
1;"""These bully springs are excellent for dogs who tend to scarf things down quickly. My French bulldog (28 lbs) would chew half weay through a regular 6-inch bully stick and then basically swallow what was left. (This is why he never gets rawhides! At least bully sticks are 100% edible/digestible.) The spring shape"
1;"""Very affordable product. Works well and is quite accurate! I like that it is very discreet and you have enough for 5 plants. No reason to spend money on expensive moisture meters. This is a cheap and effective product"
1;"""Pamela's Products are by far the best gluten free option in terms of baked goods.  These cookies are fantastic!  The flavor is terrific and there are big chunks of semi-sweet chocolate and walnuts.  While I do miss the soft"
1;These are great considering they are wheat-free and gluten-free. I was surprised how good they were. They are sweet and the chocolate chips are both chocolaty and soft. The walnuts are a great addition to this cookie as well. See the photo I posted.
1;This is great tasting rice! have been using it for a while now use to purchase it at the supermarket! This is better now we don't run out with the shippment! We are big rice eaters in our house and the kids love it!<br />It's even going on vacation with us with the rice pot :)!!
1;"""I debated a little about whether or not to order just because the reviews are so split down the middle. But I'm a big fan of other Two Leaves and a Bud varieties so I decided I had to give it a fair try. I'm glad I did! I prepared it with warm water"
1;i don't know why one reviewer said the orange flavor was overpowering.  i find it has an excellent taste and nice orange aroma.  love the tea and have been drinking it several times a day.  i'm buying more.
1;"""I love these cookies.  You just mix them all up in a bowl together and bake.  I ADD MORE CHOCOLATE chips- at least 1/4 cup more of whatever flavor I am craving at the time- or better yet chop up some chunks from a semisweet baking bar!  This makes it better"
1;"""the friends who introduced me to this don't even eat gluten-free but they use this as their chocolate chip cookie mix because they think this is the best chocolate chip cookie you can make!<br /><br />I love this mix!!! It is also way"
1;These are by far the most delicious gluten-free chocolate chip (chunk) cookies out there. Easy to make as well. Super fast shipment from the seller and packed nicely. Easy transaction. Buying more today.
1;So good that even those who do not need gluten free will also enjoy them.<br />That is the ultimate complement for a gluten free product.  Well done Pamela's!<br />I have these on subscription with Amazon.  Great deal.
1;Best cookies ever!  Every time we have an invite to a party I am always asked to bring these cookies.  In fact if I don't I get a lot of grumbling and disappointed comments.  So I never go to a party without them now :-)
1;"""<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ROKSSS >Pamela's Products Cookie Mix Chocolate Chunk -- 13.6 oz</a>These are the best Gluten Free Cookie Mixes.  I bring them to church regularly and people really look forward to them!  Love them and they are highly requested."""
1;Dear Pamela ...dont know if i should say THANK YOU?? lol or shake my fist at you..these cookies ..easy to make ..Gluten Free...are Way too yummy ..they have to be considered dangerous :)..so we shall leave it as a THANK YOU PAMELA..Highly recomend trying these
1;"""I have a wheat allergy and have tried just about every type of gluten and wheat free cookie mix out there. I have to say that this cookie mix is a-m-a-z-i-n-g and the BEST.<br /><br />Prep and Baking:<br />Super easy"
1;"""I am a chocolate chip cookie lover.  Once I learned that I had to give up wheat and other gluten products I started my search for alternatives.  That was about four years ago and boy were most of the gluten free products awful.  Then a couple of years ago I discovered Pamela's brand of baked goods and baking mixes.  I have yet to find one I did not think was wonderful.  Back to the chocolate chunk cookies.  This mix has huge pieces of dark chocolate and is delicious.  Some of the reviews that I have read state that it has too much sugar.  Yes it does"
1;Love this wrap.  Better than most for can fit a lot of veggies on it and it's only 100 calories for a full sheet.  Gald to see Amazon has it for bought it at BJs discount store on a temporary membership and notsure if we will get a full one.
1;"""And these are great.  Just like fresh roasted off the grill without having to peel them.<br /><br />Order lots of them because 3.5 Ounces add up to about 10-12 chestnuts.<br />These are great for eating out of the package or using in stuffing"
1;"""If you love chestnuts like my family does then these are the ones for you.  The wonderful thing about this product is you can get it all year round.  We LOVE them and they make a filling healthy snack anytime"
1;"""This Orzo is absolutely great.  This is the first time I have eaten it and it blends beautifully with vegetables.  I love salads and this is the way I used the Orzo.<br /><br />ORZO SALAD<br /><br />1/2 CUP ORZO<br />RED AND GREEN PEPPER- amount you want<br />ONION- amount you want<br />CELERY-amount you want<br />YELLOW SQUASH-amount you want<br />BLACK BEANS- DRAINED AND WASHED<br />WHITE SHOEPEG CORN- DRAINED AND WASHED<br />5 TLBS.

ADD THE ORZO TO THE BOILING WATER AND SALT TO TASTE.  BOIL FOR 8 TO 10 MINUTES-DO NOT OVERCOOK.  CHOP THE VEGGIES AND ADD THE CORN AND BLACK BEANS.  DRAIN THE ORZO"
1;This product is very hard to find at the grocery store. I bought a 4 pack. It came within a few days . I was very pleased with the whole transaction. Thank you for carrying this product. I will shop for it here again :)
1;I love this Orzo!  I was unable to find this in the grocery store so I was really happy to find it on Amazon.  I tried it tonight for the first time and it's delicious.  I will definitely be buying it again!
1;Ever wonder why veggies at restaurants taste better than they do at home? Vegetable Magic may be the reason. We eat a lot of catered foods and are always asking for recipes and Chef Paul's name comes up a lot.
1;The original product came with the foil seal open and seasoning had leaked out.<br />I sent an email to the seller noting this because it was to be a gift.  I had a brand new<br />product on my door step 2 days later !  Excellent service. Thank you for making it right !<br />This is excellent product !
1;I use the Crystal Light Lemonade mix  with Sugar free Tang (one tub ea) with a gallon of water and 4 Tbsp Sweet N Low to make an excellent sugar free orange drink. No other mix gives this excellent results.
1;Our local Indian restaurant always uses cardamom pods in their rice and I LOVE it!  I decided to start using them when I cooked at home but couldn't find anything but ground cardamom.  I was delighted to find the pods here and was happy to find them reasonably priced.  I will order again!
1;"""We've had this little plant for about 2 months now and it trucks along.  It is relatively low maintenance.  We just have to add water to it every now and then.  It needs to sit in about 1  of water and stay virtually swampy"
1;I've tried them all (chai teas) and this is the one I keep coming back to. Excellent all around chai taste without any one spice (like cinnamon in some chais) overwhelming the tea.<br /><br />I highly recommend.<br /><br />Buying it by the case from Amazon is real win too since the price is great and they constantly sell out at the stores in my area.
1;I love this tea. This is a wonderful chai blend that's good hot or iced. I use it in my iced tea maker. It's a big hit with our family. Buying it in bulk through Amazon is far more cost efficient than trying to purchase them as single boxes in a health food or grocery store.
1;"""I've been enjoying this particular blend of chai for quite a while.  I actually don't even want to add milk or sweeteners.  I think it is mellow all on its own but could understand the appeal for some to use milk.  I'm not a fan of sweet teas so I wouldn't want the sugar or honey traditionally served with chai.  I've even used one tea bag with a bunch of regular tea bags to make some iced tea that's quite nice in the summer.  Folks who have tried it who often want sweetener in their tea tell me it's not necessary with this combination.  Hot"
1;This chai is more flavorful than the Stash black tea chai I had ordered before. Also has the bonus of being organic. Can recommend the Good Earth brand  basically across the board. Almost all of their teas exceed expectations.
1;I love these trail mix bars. They are delicious and healthy and the price is great. To be able to get them delivered each month is a wonderful thing! I am a big Subscribe and Save fan. Shipping is free and delivery date is easily managed.  What a great idea!!!
1;My grandfather owned a small bakeshop in Scotland and I remember that Nairns oatcakes were the most popular with his customers.<br />As a kid oatcakes did not appeal to me but I subsequently developed a taste for them and like most of my grandfather's customers found that Nairns were the preferred brand. They were fired a little longer than other manufacturers oatcakes producing a crispier bite.
1;"""I've been using Hodgson Mill Organic Naturally White Flour for about a year now. One of the first things I noticed after baking with this flour is that I no longer  bloated  or had intestinal distress after eating the foods made with this flour. Soooo nice! My doctor recommended this flour to me"
1;"""Ugh.  This flour is really good.  I was hoping there was not much of a difference compared to the other organic flour I buy because these little 2 pound bags are expensive.  It makes my pizza dough so good that my brother"
1;Why put that other chemical garbage in your body when the pure original tastes this good.  The price was considerably better than the price at my local grocery store.  I ordered again after I checked local prices so I would have some to store in the pantry.  Yummy.
1;"""i LIKE The real stuff.  This is so flavorful and REAL SYRUP.  only buy the true stuff that is regulated to not be diluted or altered.  This is real maple syrup and I love the dark amber color.  I'm now getting it shipped every month on automatic shipping.<br /><br />I use this syrup in my green smoothies that I blend in my Vitamix.  Pancakes? Oh"
1;"""It's been years since I have had real Maple Syrup with my pancakes.  Since I don't have pancakes often I splurged.  Ahhh wonderfu!  Actually when you think about it 32 oz. is a lot.  So it's really not that expensive when you consider the difference. It will last a long time in the fridge.  So now once a month some friends and I will enjoy the wonderful flavor of real maple syrup.  I was pleasantly surprised at the calories"
1;"""I found this on amazon so much cheaper than getting it in the grocery store and oh soooo good!!!. I'd never in a million years put the corn syrup on my pancakes that Aunt Jemimah calls Maple....yuk!!! Real Maple"
1;This is the best maple syrup I have tasted. It has the perfect balance of sweetness and maple flavor. My kids normally will not use maple syrup because of the strong taste ( I have tried several) but they love this one. A great mild maple flavor with just the right amount of sweetness. I am glad I tried it!
1;I love this syrup on my pancakes and belgium waffles!  It has a wonderful maple flavor.  My only complaint is the price..20.00 is a lot to pay for syrup and that's why it only gets used for special occassions!

1;"""I have a black and white tuxedo male that was living outside.  He had been horribly injured by racoons and possibly in a fight with another male cat.  After we took him to our vet where his extensive injuries were tended to. After he was neutered and he recovered"
1;"""My cats love this cat food! It is so much easier for them to eat as it is so much easier for them to chew. I have older cats and this is so much better for them. I can't get the larger bags of food at the local feed stores"
1;When i want a very good medium roast i reach for Starbucks House Blend and when i want a very good dark blend i reach for Starbucks Verona.<br />Both full bodied coffees. Even the aroma is tantalizing!
1;I personally loved this popcorn. It really is addictive! Came onto Amazon to see if I could get it in bulk b/c my local store started selling it in 2 pack boxes vs. 6 packs and I think that's ridiculous. So happy to be able to buy a big box!
1;I've been ordering this oil for quite some time and I still think it's the best EVOO I've ever tasted!!  Fruity aftertaste and delicious on the front of the tounge as well.  I'm sticking with this oil for as long as I can get it!!
1;"""If you love butterscotch hard candies then this is the matcha for you! Its my new secret sinful delight! This is EXACTLY like those butterscotch hard candies from childhood!<br /><br />I think if I had to pick one matcha that I would never share with others this would have to be the one. Although there are so many I have yet to try I think so far this is my favorite. I just made myself laugh though because I have said that with almost every new matcha from Red Leaf Tea I have tried. Seriously though"
1;"""If you eat one of these bars you will want to eat the whole box!  I am very impressed with these grain bars as I am with most of Pamela's Products.  They are very tasty.  In the sample I received the bars were very balanced with chocolate and coconut flavors.  The grains are soft and chewy"
1;I highly recommend these bars.  I actually got them because they were my name but ended up really liking them.  I tend to get low blood sugar attacks so I always carry food with me in case I get hungry.  I was surprised that these bars not only tasted good but they also stayed the hunger away for a great deal of time.  I wish I knew where I could purchase them locally.
1;"""These bars are very tasty. I've had the oat chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin walnut. I have to agree with other reviewers here that the bars are very light and not totally filling. These are great for a quick"
1;"""These were a pleasant surprise...You know when you are looking around for something to munch on and you don't want another Triscuit or a Potato Chip or even something two sweet or two dry?<br />This is it!<br />These are just moist enough"
1;I go through stages where i seek out different alternatives to regular mass market products and look instead for artisinal or just somewhat unorthodox alternatives.  sometimes it works out and other times i end up with a cabinet full of stuff that noone in the house will touch.<br /><br />this time it worked great.<br /><br />this mix is an excellent change from the standard big brand pancake mixes (haven't used it for waffles).  the flapjacks have an excellent consistency and taste great.  i've actually noticed the whole family uses less syrup with this mix than our old stand by which produced pancakes that weren't much more than syrup delivery vehicles.  the cakes are moist and delicious.
1;We used this mix for our Easter breakfast at church.  We fed 150 people and got rave reviews.  Everyone LOVED the pancakes and came back for 2nds and even 3rds.  This is the mix we will have in our house from now on!
1;I am on a quest to replace any and all of the enriched bread products my family eats with 100% whole grain products....that taste good....without breaking the bank.  This mix totally fits the bill.  None of us could believe that these pancakes were made from whole grains let alone a mix.  Most of the time I make pancakes from scratch - not anymore - this is just way too easy and hearty.  The price is right and my family is happy.  We will continue to buy these for a long time :)
1;I have made waffles with this mix twice and pancakes once.  The texture is perfect. Because they are whole wheat they are hearty but they are still fluffy.  They are slightly sweet and smell so yummy while your waiting for them to finish................  The next time I order the three pack I'm going to try one of their other products.
1;Kodiak Cakes Buttermilk & Honey pancake mix is by FAR the best tasting pancake mix I've ever used.  The fact that it is 100% whole grain and all natural is a major bonus. I feel very good about feeding this to my son. If you check the company's website you can find some great recipes. My son loves the one for pumpkin pancakes. Do not hesitate to buy this mix. You won't be disappointed and the subscribe & save price can't be beat!
1;My husband came across Kodiak flapjacks when he was traveling West a few years ago.  It's not a product we can find around us and we were excited to see that we could purchase through Amazon. The buttermilk and honey version is highly recommended.
1;"""First when I opened the box the smell was divine. The pancake batter before mixed w/ water smells like fresh baked sugar cookies. Then I added water and poured it into my waffle maker/grill. Cooked up fine with no graininess or lumps. I didn't follow the directions of 1 cup water to 1 cup mix. I just added water and stirred until I  got my desired consistency. My waffles looked like any other waffle. I poured my syrup and it was to my surprise delicious. Very light flavor. Not bitter or too sweet. I expected a strong bitter taste when I saw wheat flour and a gritty or graininess b/c it's organic but it's a smooth texture like ihop pancakes or regular pancakes. The vanilla and the honey in the mix give a nice mild taste to it without making the pancakes too sweet. I think the buttermilk they use makes the over all product not taste like cooked grain mush as well. I would definitely buy this mix again. I got the 3 pack for $11 through amazon's subscribe and save. I've heard 1 box can run you anywhere from $6-8. I'm not a big breakfast person"
1;I haven't tried a bad seasoning flavor yet.  These are wonderful.  My favorites are Vegetable Magic (not just for vegetables....makes delicious omelettes) and Pork Magic (saute centercut pork chops in olive oil and sprinkle with the Pork Magic).  My kids LOVE it.
1;I love this seasoning. It truly is magic. I eat fish all the time and this brings out the flavor. I feel like a television cook when I use this stuff. I no longer worry about running out of Old Bay as long as I have this in the house..
1;"""This is by far the best GF pasta I've tried.  Holds up well when you cook your sauce/gravy and want to add pasta directly to the sauce/gravy.  Doesn't fall apart when stirring and will even hold up when refrigerated overnight and reheated and stirred in oven. Also"
1;I love this pasta!! It's not sticky like gluten free rice pasta and doesn't have the weird taste of whole grain pasta. It's pretty much the same to me as regular pasta and I grew up on italian cooking. Now that I have digestive issues I eat gluten free and have to say this is my new favorite pasta! Thanks Amazon for your subscribe and save which makes it affordable as well. Eating healthy is expensive and it's great to have this option to make it more affordable!!
1;"""I typicaly drink Mountain Dew or more recently the Picth Black but this is my favorite soda! Beaware they have tried to change the logo and add the words  Fruit Punch  ... as if we don't know. It's just a bad logo change and someone should be fired for it. Unfortunatly I have yet to find a substitute for the times when I can't find it so get it while you can!"""
1;Grew up drinking Tahitian Treat down South. Sadly they don't sell it here in Seattle  So glad I'm able to get my fix!<br />If you've never tried it maybe you shouldn't. They are addictive  Quick tip...Put it in the Freezer before drinking!
1;As a young girl this was one of my favorite treats! As the years passed it became unavailable. I am so glad I was able to find it here on Amazon. My family and I can once again enjoy the great taste of Tahitian Treat!!!
1;"""Tahitian Treat was  the soda of choice  when I was growing up.The closest thing to it is Albertson's Fruit Punch soda.The only people who know about it are the 70's & 80's generation if you was in the south and midwest as far as I know.They still sell it in Dallas."""
1;"""This is an excellent alternative to sugar. It tastes better than sugar or any of those artificial sweeteners. This nectar has a low glycemic index which is good news for diabetics. I can't wait to try cooking with this. I use it in coffee"
1;I Love this blend on Chicken for a Caesar Salad. I used to start thinking about it 2 hours before lunch. Serve the Chicken hot drizzled with fresh Lime juice. Awesome! I must have had it 20 times at Checker's in Calistoga.
1;I love this tea the taste is really good and it smells good as well my husband and I are year around tea drinkers and also we dont even have to add any sugar ( well I use honey on some teas) but this one you don't need anything extra and I will say it really does work drink plenty of water threw out the day .... And usually in the am you will be cleaning  it out lol ... I didn't have any stomach pains or anything but I eat well also!! I recommend this to any and everyone!!
1;"""This tea works on my fiance's digestive track as she has an issue with colitis and this product along with essential enzymes helps her to absorb and digest foods that otherwise would give her pains while in her digestive track"
1;"""I have been using Laci Le Beau Super Dieters Tea for years.  There is no subsitute.  Many women in my family use it as well.  This keeps me moving better than anything else and I suffer from Chronic Constipation.  I would recommend this to anyone who could use a gentle"
1;"""I have tried each of the flavors in this combo pack and I must say I am really impressed! The flavors are amazing - like what you get when you take the time to brew a cup of coffee or steep tea bags for an amazing ice tea. I am so impressed with the convenience that I have with making these products in my Keurig brewer. In about 30 seconds"
1;My mom Bee has been a licorice lover for many years. Bee is now 96 and will be 97 in November..She has partial dentures so the hard candy is not only delicious but  the perfect answer. I have to watch her though as she<br />would go through a bag in a couple days if I let her.
1;"""Love the big chunks of apple and awesome cinnamon taste. Tastes like apple pie oatmeal. Great when cooked per the directions for perfect consistency. My 12 year old even loved it straight out of the bag"
1;This product is a very health snack for your pup as it is made of 100% beef liver. My puppy does all of his tricks to get this treat. It is a little pricy but the container is large so it should last a long time as long as you don't overfeed.
1;My girls love these. I cut them up smaller and use them for training. Definately able to keep the dogs attention when they know something yummy and tasty is coming their way. The price was right too for the amount. As long as the price remains perfect I plan on having a steady supply of this great product!
1;"""My Golden can get picky and eating is not a priority for him. I was worried during training he was going to be too anxious to not eat any training treats. Well...these he will eat and I am very great-full! However"
1;We cut these up into small pieces for our Corgi pup (so each treat actually becomes 8-10 mini treats) to prevent throwing off his diet.  This allows us to give him multiple treats for going potty outside (like 3-5 mini treats each time).  We also use these whenever our puppy meets a stranger -- we make sure all four paws are on the ground before we give it to him and he has already learned to inhibit his desire to jump up on people!  These are amazing and I appreciate that they are made in the USA -- no weird chemicals to worry about -- and our pup loves to work for them!
1;My dogs have been eating liver treats for years.  We also use the treats for training.  The treats are 50% crude protein so you are getting a high quality treat.  Just make sure your dog has enough water since the treats make  my dogs thirsty.
1;"""Dogs love these treats more than any other treats I've ever found.  In situations where other treats fail to get our dog's attention - <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019O5Z0Q >Charlee Bear Turkey Liver & Cranberry Flavored Dog Treats</a>"
1;The 21 ounce Pro-Treat Beef Liver Treats are a great value and my dog loves them.  I just need to reach for the tub and she will sit and put up her paw.  I even cut them into tiny pieces sometimes and sprinkle them onto her food.  She gobbles up her food when I do that.  This size will last a while.
1;I have tried several different kinds of training treats from pet stores and they all either made my English Bulldog puppy sick or lose interest. The liver is working great she absolutely loves them and they keep her attention 100%!
1;My dogs LOVE this product. They beg for them. They also came recommended by our animal trainer.  My only issue is that I took advantage of the Super Shipper Saver and for some reason it took almost a month to get here. VERY VERY slow shipping.
1;"""These liver treats are great for training. We adopted a German Shepherd puppy and have been using these to teach her basic commands. She goes bananas for these and learned very quickly even though she's a VERY stubborn pup. Since she's still small I cut the large cubes into thirds or quarters(she doesn't know and doesn't mind)to make our training sessions go further since it's recommended that you give only a few treats a day to avoid digestion problems. Also"
1;Every pup I have ever owned LOVED these treats. They will do anything for them and only like this brand! I tried another and they refused to eat them! If you love your pups and treat them like children-BUY THESE!<br />Mine are not too spolied - DIVA and TIFFANY! They get them every holiday and I am never without a supply on hand. Try greenies too!
1;The Gimborn Liver Treats are by far my dogs favorite treat.  The are a wonderful training reward.  Very good quality.  Just beware your dog will sniff them out from wherever they are hidden in your pockets.
1;This a wonderful treat.  my 3 Labs just love them.  very healthy and natural.  the small cubes are great for hiding in toys and a great mental challenge for the dogs  to figure out to get to the treats. I work in the animal field and every dog I have come across just gobbles them up. Just a few little cubes go a long way
1;"""I use these as a training treat when I am working with my two dogs. My dogs were getting bored of the same ol' treats even though I tried to give them a wide variety. This one BY FAR is their favorite"
1;"""These are the best training treats you can buy.  My dog is more motivated in doggie class because of these treats than any other dog in class.  He loves these treats so much that he is not very interested in most other dog treats"
1;My 5 month old lab goes nuts over these liver treats.  Our vet recommended these as a healthy treat.  Our pup acts like a cat with catnip over these. A big hit. The price and size are excellent and should last a good while.
1;"""We have been using these dog treats for a long time.  The dogs love them a lot!  You cannot go wrong with these because they are all natural.<br />The only thing that I would say is a little disappointing about them is that some of the pieces are very small making them no good as treats.  You end up with liver  dust  when the larger pieces are used.  I generally take this  dust  and mix it into home made dog food for extra flavor.  Therefore"
1;Bought these based on the review and the type of treat. My Peagle puppy loves these more than cheese! Perfect for training and they can be cut up easily so you don't overfeed. Great price compared to other treats of the same quality. Highly recommended.
1;"""My dog is a rescued stray.  You'd think she'd be happy to eat any treat offered to her.  Not so.  She's pickier than any dog I have ever seen or heard of.  I have thrown away many bags of treats and dog cookies.  But these things"
1;"""Pro-Treat Freeze Dried Liver Dog Treats / B000255OIG<br /><br />This is the sort of product that makes me wish I could give more than 5 stars... My puppy absolutely adores these liver treats - our dog trainer calls them  puppy heroin . With these treats"
1;"""My dog is a very picky eater.  She has a very sensitive stomach and has special food.  This is the only treat I've found that doesn't make her throw-up.  She loves it so much she won't eat her regular dog food unless I mix the treats with it.  They're a little pricey"
1;"""I have a chihuahua that is the pickiest eater in the world!  I could not find any treat that this dog liked.  I finally tried the Pro-Treat Liver treats for dogs and she loves them!!  I actually have to give them to her at different times on different days"
1;Love this faucet.  My husband had installed the same one in our old house so when our current faucet was leaking I told him not to fix it and we would buy the same one.  It was easy enough for him to install but he did need my assistance a few times to help hold some things in place. Looks great and works great.
1;"""My dog would do anything for his liver treats!  ...and whenever any of his playmates are out for a walk they drag their owners to our house so they can have a liver treat as well (in fact most of their owners now buy it for them).  It is healthy"
1;ALL I DO IS SHAKE THIS CONTAINER AND MY DOG COMES RUNNING. SHE HAS HAD FOR OVER A YEAR AND PREFERS TO ALL TREATS AND FOOD. I FEEL GREAT AS THEY ARE GOOD FOR HER. THE PRICE SEEMS HEFTY BUT YOU CAN CUT THE PIECES UP EVEN THOUGH FREEZE DRIED. OUR FAV DOG TREAT FOR SURE. MAKES YOU FEEL GREAT TO GIVE YOUR PUP A EXCELLENT SOURCE OF ALL NUTRIENTS THEY LOVE. I FEEL LIKE I'M TRICKING HER.
1;We have a variety of treats for our two shitzus.  Their favorite are the freeze-dried livers.  Nice big container that always has the dogs running when they hear me opening the lid.  Bought two of these.
1;I have been giving the Stewart's Pro-Treat Freeze Dried Beef Liver to my maltipoo named Elvis Lee for many years now along with his daily meals.  It is all PURE Freeze Dried Beef Liver which provides him with protein since he is a very active boy who likes to go for long walks and play ball!  Elvis Lee is very particular about what he likes and this Freeze Dried Liver is on his list of FAVORITES!!
1;My dog loves these and so do I : ).  No yucky texture or greasy feel such as with hot dog pieces or cheese pieces and no grossness in your pocket or treat bag.  And my dog will do a lot for a taste of these treats.
1;These Stewarts Liver treats are the love of my wirehaired dachshund's life.  Nothing else comes close.<br />I have bought them from several sources and sometimes they are crushed but those fom Amazon arrive in fine condition and ready for munching.
1;i always try to feed healthy snacks. My dog does not always like them as much as less healthy snacks.<br />This is the snack that we meet in the middle about.... actually she likes this the best of all her snacks!!!
1;"""I was pet sitting recently and the dog I was sitting for had these in her treat pouch. She loved them so I tried them with my dogs. All 3 dogs were quite well-behaved whenever they saw me reach for these goodies. My son and I jokingly call them  doggie crack . They're good for them"
1;"""By far this treat is the best one that I have bought.  We used it to crate train out puppy and whenever he saw us going for the bucket or smelled it being opened he would run for his crate and sit in there until we gave him this treat.  The large bucket is the most economicay"
1;"""I've been experimenting with Cajun food for quite sometime. I've talked with several different Creole Chefs and two of the three that I have spoked with have recommended this seasoning over any other. From now on"
1;I absolutely love this product!<br />As a home-chef I use this product on just about all of my seafood. It adds a distinct flavor that that takes any fish or seafood to another level of excellence.<br /><br />Great for even the most basic cooks!
1;"""Im was never a fan of eating fish but my diet requires it. I dug through my cupboard and found this seasoning my wife had bought last year. I tried it and fell in love with it. I went through the entire bottle in about 2 weeks. However when I tried to get more"
1;I'm from New Orleans but now I live in Michigan so I don't get many chances to have Cajun food. I ordered some crawfish tails from Louisiana Crawfish Company and used this spice to make Blackened Crawfish Tails. Man was it ever good!!
1;This was my first purchase of any gluten free cheese curls and I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the crunch.  My husband even likes them and he is very picky about his snack foods. To me they taste better than the other name brand cheese curls and with less fat and calories.
1;My local grocery store had to stop carrying these because the distributor dropped them. I tried other stores with no luck. These are the only cheese curls that really taste like cheese and don't taste like you're licking salt. I'm so glad I still have a source to get them.
1;"""I tried many times to find a replacement for Planters Cheeze Curls (now they discontinued it). And I think that is a perfect replacement. May be not only perfect but better than original from Planters. So"
1;"""This is a great pork seasoning. I first tried this as a sample I requested  from the company - for FREE - and then had to buy a large can because I loved it so much. I tried it the first time on a couple of 1 1/2  thick Iowa style pork chops"
1;"""I tried Simply 7 hummus chips at the NY winter wine festival 2 weeks ago and to say I was pleasantly surprised is an understatement. They are absolutely delicious!! It has the requisite crunch of a chip and no artificial colors"
1;"""THIS COFFEE IS REALLY DELICIOUS.A COOL LATIN FLAVOR.EXCELLENT.5 STARS I GIVE TO THIS COFFEE.I HOPE AMAZON NEVER GET RID OF IT BECAUSE THIS COFFEE IS REALLY HARD TO FIND IN MY LOCAL SUPERMARKETS.AND I HPE ALWAYS THEY GOT THE SAME LOW PRICE FOR 6 PACKETS.THE LESS I GET THIS COFFEE BAGS IS $2.49 PER PACKET.GOOD DEAL"
1;So far this is the very best coofee I have had with the new Keurig. The blend is just perfect for the first cup of coffee in the morning. Since I had gotten this my son is now serving his family the same brand and flavor. ust the right strength as it is not to weak and not to strong. Perfect and very enjoyable cup each time.
1;I have  a Keurig coffee maker and have tried lots of K-cups and different brands and roasts of coffee but the Natucket Blend is my FAVORITE.  The Nantucket blend is a smooth and rich coffee that is not too strong or too weak.  Anyone who owns a Keurig should try the Natucket Blend by Green Mountain.  They will realize it is the best!  The price is great on Amazon too!
1;"""So far I've had no problems ordering this product and receiving it as promised. I am a Nantucket lover and occasionally will buy a specialty/seasonal flavor on the side.Green Mountain is extremely expensive at most local stores! I've been buying bulk online for years. (I'm a coffee-holic) I suggest buying/trying a sample at your local store. (some even will let you brew a free cup!) Then"
1;You can't make a better cup of regular coffee flavored coffee than this at home. I had been trying in every way imaginable for nearly forty years to make that 'perfect cup'. My patience has paid finally paid off.
1;Green Mountain makes a great medium roast coffee called Nantucket Blend.  I checked all over for the best price and was able to get free shipping on my order.  I will order my coffee from Amazon again.
1;"""I have tried a variety of K-Cups for my Keurig Brewer and find Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend works best for me in taste.  I shop Amazon when offers are available including free shipping.  Amazon has been a good source for buying various items"
1;I had been trying to find this specific type of K-cup because my husband enjoys it so much but couldn't find them in the stores anywhere so I checked on Amazon and they were not only in a large quantity but much cheaper than buying them in the stores.  I won't do that again! www.amazon.com!!!
1;"""My husband is an avid coffee drinker.  Our son presented him with  a Kuerig Brewer for his birthday.  That was two years ago.  Since that time he has been experimenting with various  flavors  of the K-Cups.  This Nantucket Blend has become another  favorite  of his.  Thanks for making it so easy to order and receive from Amazon.."""
1;"""I first tried this brand and blend as part of a k-cup sampler pack. I was immediately in love with this k-cup! It's my very favorite so far. My personal preference for coffee is a nice bodied medium roast"
1;This is simply the best non-flavored coffee in K-cups that I have tried.  I drink my coffee black and this has an excellent coffee aroma and taste.  It's not bitter nor acidic but has a full coffee flavor.
1;I recently purchased the Keurig B-60 Special Edition Brewer from Amazon.  It came with a sample variety pack of 12 different K-cup blends (note no light blends included).  I tried all of them and found this particular blend to be the best to my liking although I do prefer a light blend.  It has a nice coffee aroma (like one you would smell at a good restaurant but can't produce at home) and surprised me by tasting as good as it smelled.  It is a medium blend and tastes relatively smooth without an excessively strong or acidic aftertaste.  Recommend to fellow Amazon customers that prefer a  medium blend coffee.  I recently found the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend available at my local Walmart and plan to write a review on it.
1;"""I was recently given the top of the line Keurig single cup coffee maker from Costco that came with a lot of different flavors to test out.  This Nantucket blend was easily the best of the bunch.  It truly is a great tasting coffee and I can't believe it comes out of my Keurig.<br /><br />Now I do drink a cup of coffee every day and I'm not fond of the waste that this product produces so I actually have one of these <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW >ekobrew Cup"
1;"""<span class= tiny > Length:: 1:30 Mins<br /><br /></span>Delicious medium-roast blend with complex tones (5 stars)<br /><br />The name belies an intoxicating medium-roast blend that fuses flavors from Central America"
1;"""I have not found a bad  Keurig  coffee version yet.  This one included. Since receiving my machine I have been to Starbucks..maybe twice since the beginning of January.  I used to go 5X a week.  My husband is LOVING this gift"
1;"""I've had my Keurig B-40 brewer for almost 18 months.  I've probably tried over 30 different k-cup varieties.  One of my 5 favorites is the  Green Mountain Nantucket Blend . Not too strong and not too light.  Will wake you up but without a 'Jolt'."""
1;Over the last year and a half we have been trying all different coffee for our Keurig and making our friends and family do a taste test whenever they drop in.<br />This coffee far and away won everyone over except uncle Pete who likes his coffee to look like chocolate syrup and make your eyes pop.<br />Mild but not weak. Great tasting.  The only coffee we will be serving at our house from now on. I have just put it on auto delivery. Love it !
1;One of my favorite coffees by Green Mountain.  Huge savings by ordering through Amazon versus grocery stores or other sites.  Coffee does come loose in the box but I like to use my handy dandy lazy susan to hold them anyway. :)
1;Have tried most all of the k - cup types of coffee and have decided that the nantucket blend is the best tasting cup of coffee available anywhere. Always a perfect taste and very good mouth appeal . LOVE THIS COFFEE !!!!
1;This is a terrific tasting coffee.  My daughter and I have tasted many different brands and flavors and we have enjoyed this one the most.  The best part was finding it on Amazon.  The ease of  ordering and great price are great.  Now we never have to wake up in the morning and realize that we are out of this great eye opener because of the convenience  of being able to order so many at one time.
1;I love the Green Mountain Nantucket coffee. It is every thing I hoped it would be.The taste and aroma is awesome. I certainly will purchase it again and again. Try it. You just might love it as I do. I get my coffee through Amazon and it is so easy and delivery is quick.  Pamela Hebert
1;We enjoy Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend K-Cups so much that I subscribe for a monthly delivery.  There are other coffees we like but Nantucket Blend is our favorite for our Breakfast Brew.  The price is reasonable for K-Cups too.
1;"""I've tried several varieties of coffees for my Keurig Coffee maker and the<br />Green Mountain Nantucket Blend has emerged as my Number 1 favorite for my<br />first cup of coffee in the morning and an occasional  pick me up  cup in<br />the afternoons.  Not too strong"
1;This worked out great! I ordered 4 boxes! IT was a great deal and  on top of it I used my discover card cbb to pay for it so really it was free too me! LOVE IT best deal I could find anyways! hope you can enjoy it like I Do!
1;I'm on my second order of this mix and had to buy an extra one for a friend that's hooked on this too.  Great taste although maybe not what you're expecting if you make the Americanized version of chili.  Smells wonderful while simmering.  I have changed the recipe a bit......use 2 - 14oz cans of Mexican style chunk tomatoes
1;This is as good as what I had in Peru - try mixing 1 tablespoon with 8 oz of an alfredo sauce - mix in shreaded chicken previously (2 breast)  cooked to your liking - let simmer on low for about 15 minutes - awesome
1;"""I first got this at a co-op I worked at a few years ago. Honestly it sat on my shelf for about a year before I got around to using it in some homemade chili. I put the same amount of the Hungarian Paprika the chili as I had with regular generic paprika in the past. Whoa Nelly! That stuff turned my mild chili into crazy hot! Everyone loved it. Since then I've repeatedly been asked to bring my chili to gatherings. When they ask what's in it I just say paprika. "
1;"""I went on a search for Japanese Black Sugar (from Okinawa) after my local Japanese Markets all stopped carrying it. I was introduced to black sugar while living with a girl from Kyoto for 3 years. She preferred using black sugar because she believed it was rich in minerals (I cannot confirm or verify this)"
1;"""The Previous reviews sums up the quality taste of this product.I found this product almost 20 years ago at a diner in Pismo Beach.At the time the Pepper Plant was a local (Atascadero) mom & pop operation and couldn't be found south of Santa Barbara or north of San Luis Obispo.I was living an hour north of San Francisco and was fortunate enough to purchase the sauce at the diner"
1;This marmalade is so light and tasty on toast. Sellers are wonderful and pack beautifully. also recommend the prickly pear jelly as chicken glaze and prickly pear syrup - add a bit to homemade lemonade and enjoy!
1;My doctor told me I should eat more walnuts and although I have walnuts for baking they just don't quite cut it for munching.  I can also chop these to put into other things.  I tend to like the mixture of sweet and savory (these are more salty than flavored with anything) and are very good.
1;"""The Emerald Dry Roasted Walnuts are a delicious treat that we enjoy having when guests are coming over for cocktails.  We always get excited comments from our guests.  I don't know why local retailers do not carry a supply in their stores.  However"
1;"""I started eating Emerald Nuts Dry roasted Walnuts about three years ago.  And I acquired such a  must have  appetite for these walnuts.  I can't find them in local stores.  Usually sold that I could find at military commissaries.  I was glad I checked with Amazon.com"
1;"""My wife is 76 years old and is missing a few important chewing molars and found that these walnuts were very light and tender making them very easy to chew and enjoy. I have no chewing problems and enjoy them as well on occasion. I would normally have a negative reaction in my mouth when eating more than one walnut directly out of the shell"
1;I've ordered these Emerald Dry Roasted Walnuts (6 pack of 9 oz. canisters) twice and they've been great.  Excellent flavor and both shipments were fresh.  I've read that walnuts have a short shelf life and was concerned the first time I ordered that I'd get old or rancid walnuts. I was very pleased with this product and will order more.
1;"""I'd just like to say that this seems to be a great brand of dog food. I've been doing some research on which brand to stick with and so far this is it. After finding brands I like and then having such a difficult time getting them in the stores"
1;Once again if you love Hot & Spicy foods you have to give these a try! I have also tried the Tabasco Spicy Dill Pickles and you need to try them also. I personaly think that all these Tabasco items that I have reviewed are just what I like. Order some of these Tabasco items and see what you think.
1;SPECIAL K IS BATTING 1000 IN THE SNACKS DEPARTMENT BUT ESPECIALLY WITH THESE CRISPY CRUNCHY DELICIOUS CHIPS. SOUR CREAM + ONION WAS SPOT ON + GREAT. THESE HOWEVER HAVE A LITTLE SPICY SIGNATURE I'VE NOT TASTED B4. EXCELLENT! A BIT OF ADVICE. COUNT OUT THE 27 CRISPS AHEAD OF TIME + THEN PUT THE BOX ON A HIGH SHELF! ..HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
1;I LOVE these chip.. I just started dieting and this satisfy every bit of my salty cravings. They are perfect and they taste AMAZING! I don't get the bad reviews but to each their own. I LOVE them!! &lt
1;"""Someone please tell me why this is not available as a  Big Bowl .  This is the best flavor that Nong Shim offers and has served as a quick lunch at work more times than I can count.  Fantastic flavor"
1;I've been buying the Nong Shim Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowls for over a year now. They are really great when you want something warm and quick. I like that the flavor is in a packet so you can add as much or as little of it as you want. The flavor of them is also good for something that is an instant noodle. I have tried other brands of instant noodles and they just don't have the taste that these do. Most other ones are more bland and just not very good. I will continue to buy these noodle bowls to have on occasion when I need something quick and easy.
1;It is a little on the sweet side but does not taste like a strong vodka.  I usually enjoy it as a dessert drink. It is still a good strong vodka but the sweet flavor kills the alcohol taste resulting in a very smooth drink.  I usually mix it with a little bit of ice water and it is perfect!
1;Don't just giggle at the can- open it and eat it!<br />There is nothing more wonderful than Spotted Dick with lashings of custard and a good cup of strong tea with friends. YUM! I keep it in the cupboard and am ready for friends and tea at a moment's notice. This is a rich sponge cake with currents and savory rich tones of brown sugar. The chocolate and sticky Toffee and Treacle are all good too - when you can get them.<br /><br />I know the name seems a bit naughty--it just adds to the fun of offering some cultural engagement to our wonderful world. I do slip it into gifts and offer to bring dessert to friends. BUT I also love this line of products for the QUALITY!
1;"""I got this a few years ago during a trip to Albania.  Albanians refer to it as the  gypsy curse .  Some people are grossed out by the spots but I think they are glorious.  Women go crazy when I bring it out at parties.  They love the spongy texture.  I'm glad to see that this comes in a pack of 6.  I was getting tired of telling people to keep their hands of my spotted dick.  Now everyone can enjoy their own."""
1;Some may think it's a funny name but it is what it is. The best dick in a can you can get. You should go to your local market and ask for it by name. Don't try to make it at home it just isn't the same. I can tell you good dick is hard to come by.<br />Jolly good then just ask for it by name Spotted Dick.
1;"""i purchased a can of this at a grocery store after a night of vodka and ojs... so we all know WHY i bought it...<br /><br />on a more serious note... it's good... if you don't like the flavors in fruit cake"
1;I love cornbread. This is cheap & very good. It is sweet & delicious. It is also very easy to prepare. I enjoy it with real butter or a little honey. Great stuff! Can't beat it for price! I usually buy this at the store though.
1;"""I can honestly say that this is THE BEST oatmeal I have ever eaten.  I am having a hard time locating it in NC.  Costco used to carry it but doesn't carry it any longer.  The shipping charges on the company's website are too high"
1;"""I buy my Coach's Oats at Costco when they have it.  I love it...it cooks quick and fills you up.  The best part is that it's really healthy and is a whole grain.  The bag will last you a long time and it stays fresh.  If you haven't tried this product"
1;"""I have to tell you all this one is the best I've tasted. Seen this at Costco one day a month ago. I only had purchased one 4.5 lb bag. I had like it so much I had gone back for more. Although cheaper than Amazon"
1;i love this stuff! im 15 yrs old and i like to eat organic/healthy/non-processed foods and this stuff definitely gets the job done. its a very healthy way to start off the morning and its only cost 14 bucks!
1;"""This tastes kinda like Jamba Juices Steel Cut Oatmeal. Great and easy to make. Microwavable too. Cooking stove top isn't THAT much better than microwaving it so I just microwave it. It is only $6.39 at Costco though"
1;"""That's the one and only ingredient in this oatmeal.  No sugar. No salt. nNo preservatives or  natural flavors .  No food dyes - none of that.  Just whole grain goodness.  Cooks up in just a few minutes. I love this oatmeal!"""
1;Bought this in the Maui Costco and thought it tasted so great we dragged home the unfinished huge bag of oatmeal.  Went to our local Costco and they did not sell it but another type of cut oatmeal which is not nearly as good and a different texture.  This is a fine tasting healthy oatmeal.
1;"""Finding great tasting steel oats that cook as quickly as processed oatmeal is not easy to do. These oats can even be microwaved and never get gummy. I originally found these in California while visiting family and could not find them in Virginia when I returned home. You have to purchase two big bags minimum when getting them from the Internet"
1;"""Another delicious old fashioned Boylan Bottleworks flavor of soda. I say old fashioned because they are a 100 year plus company that makes their sodas the way that everyone made them before they changed all the ingrediants in the 1970's. Their Black Cherry's deep flavor comes from a blend of different cherries along with other high class ingredients here. This is the only cherry soda I know that uses only a mix of pure natural black cherries for the flavor"
1;"""My experience with soft drinks has been mostly limited to the major brands so this was quite a change---these sodas have a much cleaner( less chemical)and therefore more refreshing taste than the Coke/7up/Canada Dry variety.  The cane sugar and glass bottles seem to make all the difference( although I still prefer Canada Dry to Boylan's Ginger Ale).<br />$3.25 per 12 oz. bottle is a bit steep. I would check your local specialty markets to see if they carry this"
1;My twin girls loved the gerber sweet carrots during first year as we moved to solid foods and I loved the price of the 12 pack through the subscribe n save program discount!  I also enjoyed having this food shipped directly to my doorstep when I needed it and always having enough in the cupboards to keep my girls happy.  I highly recomend this flavor and quantity through the subscribe n save program!
1;"""I had some at PF Changs and raved about it so my daughter who is a gifted giver picked up on it and gave me some along with a cast iron tea set for my birthday. I keep a box at work and brew it in a cup and it tastes just fine"
1;"""i first tried this tea in a hotel room in san diego and never forgot it.  checked it online and was happy to find amazon had much better prices than if bought from the company.  it doesn't come in the cute"
1;I've purchased K-cups in a variety of blends and have learned that the batch to batch consistency isn't perfect.  But unlike some of the reviews of Green Mountain Breakfast Blend I've never had a bad batch of this blend.  If you enjoy a light roast this one seems perfect to me.  It is  available in both regular and decaf.  And for extra savings you may want to order the 50 count box from Amazon which is only $0.60/cup now.
1;I must say that this was a great offer.  I use my Keurig Brewer everyday and this was my favorite coffee.  I shop everyday on Amazon because of all the good deals and more important I trust Amazon that what they are selling is just as they described it.  I have bought coffee from many places but this was the best price.  Keep up the good work Amazon.  Thanks!
1;"""The Green Mountain Breakfast Blend provides a perfect start for my mornings.  I do not like the strong robust blends that many prefer.  The Green Mountain Breakfast Blend is the perfect lighter blend to exactly match my needs for a cup of coffee to start my day. When I searched on Amazon.com <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047RQ9M0 >Green Mountain Coffee  Breakfast Blend"
1;This breakfast blend is just the right strength for my morning cup of coffee.  I drink it black and it is wonderful. I also ordered this in the decaf and it's just as good...can't tell the difference in the decaf and regular roast.
1;I bought this for my husband because he wanted a breakfast blend and isn't too fond of the Newmans. He likes the Dunkin Donuts but it's pricey. he said this blend is up to par with the dunkin brand. You only get 12 in the dunkin package and it's over $12. he likes this better than the donut house also.
1;"""This coffee is perfect for those who don't like strong coffee shop coffee.  It's mild yet has a bold flavor.  I actually make two cups with each k-cup.  That helps me save lots of money and works perfectly when I want more than one cup in the morning.  Second cup is lighter"
1;I purchased a Keurig single cup brewer for my elderly Mom and with that I sent her a large sample pack.  She pick the Breakfast Blend as her favorite.  This was a great deal so I sent it to her direct.  The K-Cups were all dumped in one box with not much packing protection.  I was sent an email from the company ahead of the delivery so I was aware and all was fine.
1;This is my husbands favorite coffee and it is the best of all the breakfast blends.  Green Mountain really make some great well balanced coffees.  This one is perefct for those who do not like an over powering cup of coffee.
1;This is my house's go to breakfast blend coffee.  Not too strong- but not weak we find the flavor very enjoyable and it a nice middle of the road coffee for guests.  My wife likes with cream and sugar but tastes equally at home black.  Doesn't seem to have a ton of pep- I can drink multiple cups in a sitting.  A little planning ahead (2 days with FREE PRIME shipping) and this package is a much better deal than the big boxes or supermakets.  Highly recommended.
1;This is an excellent coffee. It has a full flavor but not overpowering.  The Keurig K-cup system is great for single cup use or where one likes to drink various coffees.  Amazon's prices are  very competetive and the shipping is fast.
1;I love the smoothness and taste of Breakfast Blend by Green Mountain...My only negative review is that it is never on a special price value as are other blends...As long as I can afford it I will buy it.
1;I buy K-cups all the time and it was nice to buy a double pack for less money than I would have paid in the store. The breakfast blend is not a bold coffee. Being rather mellow and not bitter and with no after taste. If you are looking for a mild tasting coffee this would be a good choice.
1;My favorite blend of coffee for my Keurig. I've tried about 15 different flavors but this is by far my favorite.  Very smooth and not overpowering or bitter.  Was buying at Walmart but they stopped stocking it.  Found it at Amazon for the same price.
1;"""You can't make a better cup of regular coffee flavored coffee than Green Mountain Nantucket Blend at home. I had been trying in every way imaginable for nearly forty years to accomplish this. However sometimes I feel like something a tad bit lighter for that first cup in the morning. Enter Green Mountain Breakfast Blend. It's exactly what that first cup calls fall. A slightly lighter version of Nantucket Blend"
1;Green Mountain Breakfast blend coffee is a mild roast that goes down easy in the morning.  My wife actually runs a cup through the Keurig twice.  Buying it this way breaks down to 50 cents per K-cup versus a dollar at any store.
1;This is my every day coffee. It's a smooth coffee with no bitter after taste. This is not the coffee for those who like a strong cup of coffee. This coffee is for those who don't like to drink coffee that has been sitting  on a burner for hours but like the first cup of fresh coffee
1;"""i've been using these k-cups for months now.  the breakfast blend is perfect for people who don't like a very strong bitter coffee in the morning.  the coffee from the breakfast blend is wonderful... not too strong"
1;I love my Breakfast Blend coffee from Green Mountain. It light without a bitter aftertaste. It is a good everyday morning cofffee for me I would  recommend this to anyone who likes a light not bitter cooffe if you like a really strong cup of joe in the morning this isn't you coffee
1;"""The price of this has been fluctuating forever on amazon. This listing is the same one that different sellers will use. Some are better than others but the reviews stay with the product regardless of who is selling it at the moment. Until it becomes available as a frustration free 50 count box from amazon this is what we will have to deal with. There is another seller that offers free shipping on the 108 count box every once and a while and its free shipping for everyone not only amazon prime members. when you see it available do not hesitate on getting it. It goes fast because of the free shipping. It is still a little high at about 57 cents per cup but 43 is the lowest I have ever seen.<br /><br />This is our favorite everyday coffee. It is what we call  normal  coffee. It's not mild or bold or flavored its just a great medium body cup of joe.<br /><br />When you register your brewer with Keurig. You will be offered some free coffee. I would suggest you get this as your free coffee. You will also be offered free shipping with that order. So buy a lot of the 5 pack samplers and get the most out of the free shipping."""
1;"""The K cups were loose and not bound in plastic wrap or cardboard box.  I was very happy to see that.  The K cups were not damaged in any way and is at least a little better for the environment given the use of them"
1;"""My wife has drunk this coffee for several years.  She tried many different brands before settling on this k-cup. It is a mild great tasting brew that you will like if you like a typical donut shop coffee. Not a Starbucks brew"
1;I love this coffee it's my favorite so far I want to try them all. I don't like strong coffee and I hate bitter after taste coffee to me this is the perfect cup  of coffee. I'm not telling everyone to go out and buy it this is my own opinion.
1;Dare cookies are made in a peanut & tree nut free factory in Canada.  They are super yummy and impossible to find in Texas. I hope that Amazon continues to carry them. Dare  Maple cookies are very good too.
1;As a Canadian expat living in the USA I have been going crazy with the crap cookies down here.<br /><br />Finally found a way to bring the best cookies in the world to my door.<br /><br />Amazon Rocks !!!
1;This is the only tea in my house. I love its peachy taste and the ginger is very subtle. I have a cup every evening to put a soothing touch on my day. I got the pack of of 6 so I would never run out! Haven't tried the other ones those are next but wanted to make sure I had enough of this one.
1;We tried the tea hot and really liked the taste.<br />So we tried it as iced tea and it comes out great in the iced tea maker using 3 bags per pitcher.<br />My previous favorite was Stash peach black tea and I usually don't like the peach teas that are not from black tea.<br />Stash is still a close 2nd.
1;"""I am an avid coffee drinker as I have tried different blends from different country. This little-known Trung Nguyen blend is definitely the BEST coffee ever! Forget about black coffee from hipsters-filled Starbucks and those so-called gourmet blends from D&D. Black coffee is supposed to be bold"
1;That is why he brought this down from the heavens for us mere mortals to taste.<br /><br />There's only 2 Cereals that the we've truly been blessed with. 1. Lucky Charms 2. Cinnamon Toast Crunch. I'd throw Fruitloops in there but that's a man made attempt at creating a God given cereal.
1;I love cereal in general and Lucky Charms is up there as one of my favorites. I like my cereals a little sweet and Lucky Charms is just that. It's not too sweet. I love the marshmallows. I think they are the best marshmallows in any cereal that has them. I also like the fact that this cereal doesn't get that soggy after being in the milk for a little while. The taste is great and I can't get tired of it like some other cereals.
1;I used to visit Chipotle mexican restaurants just to douse my burrito with this delicious concoction. Then one day walking through the aisles of the local Safeway I happened upon the bottle on the shelf and my life hasn't been the same ever since.
1;"""My household was going through 2 - 3 regular 5 oz bottles per month since discovering the best pepper sauce ever and were delighted to find this one gallon jug.  Even with the coupons I got in the paper and online this is a major money saver!  With a small funnel is easy to pour into the small Tabasco bottle.  We eat it on nearly anything and everything...latino foods"
1;I have my aunt ship this at Christmas time.  It is great on its own or as a creamy butter spread with cinnamon.  I certainly hope that Amazon gets it stocked quickly.  My whole family loves this stuff!
1;"""Very very good oatmeal. I bought this because I couldn't find the Apple cinnamon Kashi at my local store and thought maybe this would taste good even though it doesn't have anything in it (Amazon says it has raisins in the description"
1;"""I've been eating this for several months now. It has just enough sweetness. The protein and complex carbs make it a very healthy and lasting snack/meal.  It's also great on toasted whole grain bread.  I'm no oatmeal connoisseur"
1;I made the Notta Pasta Spaghetti tonight for the first time with a fresh fish and tomato sauce and it was wonderful. I actually prefer this pasta to wheat pasta. I do not have a gluten intolerance but will continue to buy Notta Pasta instead of wheat pasta as a matter of choice. Great stuff!
1;"""My husband has been gluten-free for years so believe me I have tried it all. This product is the closest to  regular  pasta as I have ever tried.  As most of you know texture is the bigger problem when it comes to gluten-free food and this product measures up. My niece came to visit and says it is her favorite."""
1;I like peanut butter and the crunchy is the best style that I have found. (My wife likes the creamy version) you can't ask for anything better for a quick meal than peanut butter and crackers or a PBJ sandwich.<br /><br />What I like about peanut butter is that you get 7 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber but only 3 grams of sugar.  Easy and fast to get a snack and tastes great!  Jiff if a great choice!
1;"""I bought some Good Sense sunflower nuts at Walmart and really liked them. They were 1.68. I was glad to find them on Amazon in a 12 pack for 16.98. Not only was it like getting 2 free when you buy a dozen"
1;the perfect mixer for a summer vodka concoction or by itself for a sweet pick-me-up treat.  The sweetness isn't overpowering and the flavor it true to itself.  Perfect size for my kids to pick one up and have a sweet soda!
1;"""This is a really nice drink -- more satisfying than pop. It's carbonated juice with no sugar or preservatives added. Here's how they can say it's 100 percent juice:  filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates  is added back in. I'd really like to try more flavors -- maybe a sparkling pineapple orange? Mmmm."""
1;This drink is a great alternative to soda. It has a little bit more sugar than soda but this has better ingredients than a regular soda can. It is a little pricey for a pack of 24 but it is better for you and it taste great.
1;"""Recently I had the pleasure of trying the Kiwi Berry flavor of Switch 100% fruit juice. It is unbelievable that a sugarless carbonated drink can taste so great and yet be good for you. The Kiwi Berry was bold and tangy instead of sweet and cloying. The carbonation made the drink sparkling and energetic. Since I have recently kicked my 15 year habit of drinking Diet Coke"
1;"""I love these Switch  sodas  they are very tasty and do not contain any bad ingredients. I love to drink soda and when I go to the store I can never find any without high fructose corn syrup. These switch sodas are very easy drinking but contain NO HFCS! For that reason alone I give this a 5 star. The can size is kind of small compared to what we Americans are used to drinking 16 oz soda is the standard size here in the US. These are 1/2 that size and a quick swig can knock it out.<br /><br />The kiwi-strawberry flavor is very yummy. I highly recommend this to everyone looking for an alternative to other sodas.<br /><br />Calories: 120"
1;"""We've all loved our carbonated drinks. Some of us have gone through (or are in the midst of) real addictions to coke and diet coke. Of course these drinks have caffeine and who doesn't need caffeine. But another attractive feature that leads to addiction is carbonation. Who doesn't like that fizzy feeling?<br />So"
1;"""The Switch is a great alternative to the usual carbonated sodas.  It is all natural and 100% juice with all the vitamin C a body needs.  It tastes just about as sweet as soda but without the corn syrup/sugar.  It is less carbonated than soda but I like that.  It also has a  lighter "
1;This drink is a nice change of pace from soda.  It is an all NATURAL beverage with NO JUNK IN IT.  It is made only of juice and carbonation and that is it.  We couldn't believe it when we tried it!  It tastes really great and if I were looking for a drink without caffeine I would choose this.  The Switch is really tasty and satisfying.  I also liked that the carbonation is not quite as heavy as some sodas.  My family of four tried it and we all decided that we would buy this brand again.
1;I put this in the kids lunches for school.  They loved it as it made a nice change from straight fruit juice or UHT milk - it tasted like a soda to them but I loved that they were getting the nutrition of the fruit without the extra sugar.
1;"""I don't read every label on every drink or food I consume. I understand the switch philosophy and can appreciate the idea. I must say that if you are really health conscious and want to consume what's good for your body then you would stick with mostly filtered water and natural 100% juices that are fresh that day. With that being said I do know that everyone in my family liked the switch drink and this particular flavor (kiwi berry). I now see switch in supermarkets and have purchased a few  single cans at lunch on occasion. I don't see myself purchasing in bulk however"
1;"""The Switch Kiwi Berry is one of the most refreshing drinks that I have ever tried. It is 100% pure kiwi and strawberry juice and the difference from the regular sodas is quite obvious. Right from the first sip it feels richer and tastier than any soda product out there. After drinking it"
1;"""I don't often drink soda for a couple reasons...  it's all high fructose corn syrup and various artificial flavors (and the diet stuff has even worse stuff.)  With that said:  this stuff is good.<br /><br />It doesn't leave that weird aftertaste in your mouth"
1;This Switch Kiwi Berry ought to be on the DEA's list of banned substances it is so good.  Every one of the 8.3 ounces had me smacking my lips trying to make it last longer.  A natural sweetness and ice cold out of my refrigerator was the way I tasted it the first (and sadly only) time.<br /><br />I just wish a grocer in West Virginia would start carrying it. C'mon Wal-Mart and/or Food Lion.  Get some of this stuff!
1;"""I only received one can for testing instead of the 24 pack promised.  But I really have to say that this is truly a new and wonderful taste experience.  The taste of kiwi and berry juice is a very great mix"
1;I really wish amazon would have sent me more of these...I just started drinking this drink and I finished the whole can I one time..<br /><br />I totally love this drink and now really have SWITCHED<br /><br />This is so much better than 0 nutrition Carbonated drinks.<br /><br />Its got real fruit extracts not just essences..and is a clear smooth pleasantly carbonated drink.<br /><br />I am totally switching to this over colas...I hope my supermarkets sell these soon.
1;"""I was really pleasantly surprised with this drink. It's made from 100 percent fruit juices with no added sugar... and still tastes great. I was surprised that it does actually use the juices that describes the flavor. For example"
1;"""I Really like this Lemon Extract it is of premium quality with excellent results I do a lot of Baking and use many different Extracts and they are all made with a very high percentage of alcohol is the only way"
1;This is the second carnivorous plant I've ordered from Joel and I wasn't disappointed!<br />The first was a Red Dragon Venus Flytrap I bought a few months back which is very healthy and doing great.<br />I was so happy when I received my purchase.  The Sarracenia<br />Leucophylla was just as described and looked just like the picture! I wasn't expecting it to be so big!<br />If you are looking to buy a carnivorous plant I wouldn't hesitate from ordering from Joel.<br />His products are of high quality and he is very professional.  Thanks for my beautiful plant!
1;Smucker's is the best brand one can order for preserves.  The reason I ordered the Pineapple Preserves on line is that it is very hard to find in stores.  It has a great flavor and is quite different from other selections.
1;"""This is undoubtedly the best canned ravioli I have ever tasted. And I am not usually a big fan of canned ravioli except for a quick lunch sort of thing. I just recently came across this variety in the market here and gave it a try.  Not only is the ravioli truly overstuffed"
1;"""The case of 12 I ordered arrived with 4 (that's 1/3!) of the cans OPEN and contents all over the mailing box. They were with other canned goods (beans). What a mess! BUT Amazon came through as they always have and replaced the entire order for no charge and mailed them with Prime-1"
1;"""This milk chocolate is made with the best ingredients. 6 ingredients. And they use all vanilla and cocoa butter and whole milk powder. Hershey uses vanillin...which is a wood extract..I have a bag that was given to me"
1;I first bought the dolce gusto circle maker for the one cup action so I don't have to brew a pot. I bought the American house blend and I could not get a good flavor for myself with the cream and sugar so I was kind of disappointed. I then tried the dark roast and after the third cup I had the right amount of cream and sugar and now I love it more than any coffee place. I go through a box per week which is probably not a good thing for my body but what are ya gonna do. Enjoy.
1;If you live in LA you like strong and bold coffee like I do.  I drink it with a spoonfull of raw sugar which makes it more wonderful.  Stores in Baton Rouge no longer sell the Bold Java and I thought I would look at Amazon and was surprised to find it on their list so I have a standing order for it to mailed to my home!  No hassel and it is cheaper.  You will enjou the bold taste of this coffee
1;I was a bit hesitant on buying Folgers coffee since I associate the name with the cheap Folgers coffee that my parents drink. I was surprised how good this coffee tastes and is comparable to Starbucks. I purchases this once a month on Amazon's subscribe and save and no longer buy the gourmet coffee at the store. I gave it a 5 star based on taste and value.
1;"""This is my first experience making sticky rice so I have nothing to compare to.  But I'm happy with the quality and taste.  I found a recipe online on how to make sticky rice with mango (I always crave this dessert when we go to Thai restaurants) and it was easy peasy with this rice.  Just put a cup of rice in a bowl"
1;"""I would have to say this is one of my all time favorite foods.  My personal favorite way to eat it is to roll it into balls then place the balls into a shallow dish of freshly brewed green tea ('pi lo chun' in case you wondered).  Sometimes I use a flavored green tea as well and I also use other teas"
1;"""I was looking for a ketchup that had very low sugar content and thought a little spice would be an added bonus. So this product fit the bill perfectly. I agree with the very accurate description of the ketchup by the previous reviewer. Just that little bit of kick and the thicker texture make it amazingly versatile. I don't eat much beef"
1;I try to purchase organic as much as possible.<br />It makes perfect sence to consume organic coffee.<br />This coffee rates no. 1 on my list of coffee.<br />I have tried many and this one tops the list.<br />Prompt service and shipping.
1;"""I have 4 cats and was spending an amazing amount of money shopping for them at Petsmarts and Petcos locally. I wish I would have discovered this food earlier. This 40lb bag lasts us nearly 2 months! If you order it new from Amazon you don't even have to worry about the shipping"
1;I had been using this cat food for several months.  I had rescued a cat looking awfully skinny and dehydrated and as she began to fatten a little she quickly showed signs of pregnancy.  She gave birth a few weeks late to 6 kittens and I still have them all.  They have been fed nothing but Diamond once weaned and have beautiful coats and are very healthy and bouncy.  So thankful for Diamond.
1;I tried this out with I believe the six pound bag (or close to that size) and my cats loved it.  Upgraded to the 20lb bag and still very satisfied.  Gave my kitties meow mix in between purchases and they snubbed it.  Better keep stocked up on this!
1;Yummmm. Sat at Cafe's along Lago D'Como eating vanilla ice cream with this syrup on top in '01. I fell in love with the cherries and strong taste of cherry syrup....it's a taste sensation...watch out you could get addicted
1;"""I was interested in this product for health reasons and was surprised at what a great flavor addition it was to my menu. This is a top shelf producer with a great history in Italy. Top quality product"
1;I cannot locate this product anywhere locally.  Tried the local coffee houses.  The product they use for cappaccino has a lot of sugar in it.<br /><br />The product I purchased from Amazon which I have been using for a number of years has minimal sugar in it and a strong vanilla flavor which I like.  So glad you can provide it for me.<br /><br />Thank you.
1;My cousin brought a nostalgia box of candies from our childhood to a family reunion.  The box had everything I remembered except Bonomo's Turkish Taffy.  I finally found it.  It tastes just like I remembered it.
1;Ordered this great tasting rice combo on Oct 23 and it was delivered on<br /><br />Oct 25th.  Love Amazon's speed.  The rice combo is excellent.  Easy to cook and stands by itself on the dinner plate.  Rice is still a carbo but it taste great and has the extra minerals and vitamins already.  A nice change from white potatoes.
1;"""This is a great blend for those who do not like just the brown rice by itself. It is also tasty when you cook it with salt and butter. I've also tried adding dried cranberries and peanuts to give it a different flavor...yummy! It is a healthier alternative over the regular white rice. Although it is pricier than regular white rice"
1;"""My store stopped stocking this rice for some reason.  It is a far superior blend than anything else I've tried and so I Googled it and was surprised to find it here.  Great texture and flavor (I cook it in chicken stock).  The best thing about this rice is that it is ready to cook"
1;"""I have been a bit disappointed with one of my favorite snacks the last year or two- Jennies Coconut Macaroons.  For some reason they just have not been as good as I have experienced for the last decade or more that we have enjoyed them. I was disappointed as so many companies have compromised the original purpose of making non sugar laden snacks"
1;My husband loves this product and eats them frequently.  I personally do not care for coconut but have found these to taste similar to the cocont part of an Almond Joy or Mounds candy bar without the super-sweetness.  They consist of only two ingredients which is appealing to a few of our food conscience friends.
1;My 3 children love them. I love them. They are delish with dark chocolate covered almonds. Coconut has such great health benefits. A great way to take advantage of the benefits. My kids think they are candy bars.
1;"""I have been consuming these coconut bars for several months now after having purchased a small box at HomeGoods. These bars are delicious! They taste like the inside of a Mounds Bar. Only 2 ingredients: shredded coconut & rice syrup. I have purchased the 20 pack box through Amazon a few times. One of the latest boxes contained bars that tasted odd. They were darker in color and did not have the fresh coconut taste I was used to. Perhaps they were in a delivery truck that was hot and the oil in the coconut started to go rancid? Anyway"
1;I just had one of these bars today and I got to tell you it was good. Kind of like an Almond Joy candy bar w/o the almonds but awesome good. I am planning to buy some of these bars along with some of their other products.You will not be dissatisfied.
1;"""I have been buying these bars (without chocolate) for years and have recently found them with the chocolate.  Our family of six loves them.  They are a great bar to hold you over and give you extended fuel"
1;"""I have purchased many different flavors of the Coffee Masters ground coffee.  They are the best I have ever found.  Also discovered that they make a really awesome iced coffee on a hot day.  I just make a pot"
1;This sampler pack is very convenient. We've purchased twice now and have enjoyed having a variety of Crystal Light. My husband's favorite is the lemonade and mine is the wild strawberry. The only request I'd make - I'd love to see a variety pack that includes a decaf tea :)
1;I've never tasted a creamer I've enjoyed as much as the Coffee-Mate Vanilla Caramel Creamer. It makes every cup of coffee I drink seem like a special treat. It doesn't take a whole lot of this creamer to get a whole lot of flavor. I love it!
1;I was so surprised how wonderful these brownies taste. They are definitely superior to the standard wheat version. I also cut and freeze them and they are still great. It is nice to know gluten-free can beat mainstream mixes on taste.
1;"""My son is allergic to milk and wheat on on the ASD spectrum so he's been on the Gluten-free Casein-free diet all his life. He loves these brownies. I make them with egg white and water instead of the oil to cut out the added fat"
1;"""I have made these brownies for family and for a den of cub scouts and no one would have known they were gluten free and everyone asked for seconds!  These brownies have a fudgy texture and have bits of chocolate chips in them which are delicious.  I would say the mix is very thick and a little difficult to work with.  The cooked brownies are slightly difficult to cut into very neat edges as the edges tend to crumble a little and I would also say that they make a slightly thinner layer of brownies than most of the store brand gluten containing but they taste just as good"
1;You can't tell this from the wheat brands. Mix makes a wonderful moist brownie. I sometimes add nuts. These are wonderful. Can be made ahead and frozen for a fast treat later or for lunches. Really wonderful Products.<br /><br />The whole family really love these.
1;I tried Pamela's brownie mix first and found the brownies to be tasteless and chalky. NOT THE GLUTEN FREE PANTRY BROWNIES! Everyone - even the non GFers LOVE these brownies. I serve them on holidays and people can't tell the difference.
1;My husband who doesn't have to eat gluten free even loves these brownies.  He is picky and he prefers this over Pamela's.  Our 2 kids and myself have to eat gluten free and this is our favorite store bought mix for brownies.  It is very good with some vanilla ice cream.
1;"""I tried these brownies per recommendation from a friend.  They are truly delicious and in my opinion the best gluten free brownies out there. They are a cinch to make in a moments notice and great just as they come"
1;These brownies are AMAZING!  Better than most regular brownies I've ever had!  My cousin made them for me when I went to a party at her house.  Everyone was eating them and commenting on how good they were before they knew they were Gluten Free.<br />Try them...you'll like them!
1;These are incredible!!!!!!!!!! Took them to a gathering and they were gone in minutes and nobody believed they were gluten free. Bought 3 more boxes to have on hand. Easy and incredibly good. Makes me feel like I'm cheating on my gluten free lifestyle but without the negative side effects. Try them--you won't be disappointed.
1;"""These are soooooooo delicious!  I just baked these this evening and they were a huge hit.  We all agreed that they taste just as good if not better than some of the best wheat flour brownie mixes out there.  They were moist and very rich with a crunchy (but not hard"
1;I baked up a pan and could not keep the non gluten frees out of the pan! I actually got to freeze a couple of squares and they were just as wonderful as out of the pan.  Quite impressed with the taste.
1;Delicious fudgy brownies.  We tried the oil-instead-of butter option.  It was very good.  I added a tablespoon of leftover coffee to the batter and toasted walnuts.  My non-celiac husband requests more brownies!  I love a mix the whole family likes and we all can eat!
1;"""Finally a gluten free brownie mix that makes  real  brownies.  These come out moist and delicious!  My father-in-law eats half the pan by himself when I make them and he doesn't follow a gluten free diet.  I highly recommend these!"""
1;These brownies are a pretty good substitution to regular brownies.  They're nice & chocolate-y!  I've served them to some friends who aren't on a gluten-free diet & they say they wouldn't have known the difference if I didn't tell them.  I recommend them!
1;These are wonderful gluten free brownies.  I have brought these to social gatherings and people have raved about these not knowing that they were gluten free.  We have tried other brands of brownie mix and they just don't compare with these!
1;"""My kitty is a little messy so I needed one of these. All the local pet supply stores do not carry these any more. I was happy I found this seller on Amazon.com. Mpw my rugs can continue to be saved.  Product is as advertized. Very durable"
1;I adopted both my girls from shelters and they were eating regular old dog food. Their coats were dull...but  didn't realize how dull until they started eating the AvoDerm. This stuff is amazing. They love it and their coats are so soft and bright.
1;"""This is the only K-Cup my mother will drink. Her actual home brewer preference is Folgers 100% Columbian medium-dark roast from the can. They don't use that actual blend in K-Cups. My mother has Neuropathy"
1;Picture and Description DO NOT AGREE which is it?<br /><br />I am looking for Newman's Own Organinc Extra bold<br />second generation (same as picture)<br /><br />But the Description states Medium Roast.<br />Are they both the same or is the Picture and Description two DIFFERENT coffees?
1;Newman's own K-cups are the best i have tasted in about a year and a half of owning a Keurig. They brew strong but not bitter and don't  have the plastic/chemical taste of some k-cup blends. Great product.
1;This is my very favorite blend of coffee in the Keurig k-cups form.  It is rich and dark and is still that way when you make a large mug of coffee...some of the k-cups are weaker as you make a bigger cup.  I love that it's Fair Trade and an Organic Blend makes it all the better.  I wish that I could find it in a decaf version that was larger than a 12-pack.
1;This coffee is good quality. It is a strong medium roast with slight acidity but not overwhelming acidity. The extra bold means that the K cup has more ground coffee in it. It does not refer to the type of roast but rather the amount of coffee in the k cup. The cups are almost completely full of coffee. It's a good wake up cup of coffee for the morning and it is organic too! I find that the 8 oz. setting on my brewer makes just the right cup. Those who like their coffee weaker might like a 10 oz. setting. I would recommend this coffee if you can get it at a reasonable price.
1;This is one of my favorite bold coffees.  It is bold yet smooth and so far it has been very consistent.  I know some of the other coffees I've had there are some good and some bad shipments but this one hasn't disappointed me yet.
1;"""When I first got my K-cup machine a couple years ago I ordered virtually every coffee/tea cup brand except for the inane.  The Newman extra bold is the best  every day  coffee IMO.  There are others of course!  So order the Newman extra bold"
1;"""We've tried many of the brands & flavors out there for the Keurig System K-cups.  This is the one that we absolutely MUST keep on hand.  It's our favorite coffee to wake up with in the morning.  Tastes wonderful"
1;This one is my very favorite of all the coffees and believe me I have tried them all.  I also have most in case others want different.<br />I have ordered this brand a couple of times from Amazon and also from Costco.
1;What can I say except the coffee is not too strong and not too weak. No Bitterness. Overall a pleasant indulgence. Strong enough to stand up to plain or flavored creamers. Have tried a wide variety of brands now and this is one of my favorites. Another favorite is Sumatran Reserve.
1;This is really good coffee for that morning take-off or the afternoon booster.  This features a nice mellow but rich roasted coffee that is hard to beat.  This is one of our favorites around the office and our family enjoys it at home as well.  Recommended.  RJB.
1;Newmans makes really good coffee. This seems to be bold smooth but not overpowering. I would recommend anyone to at least try this. Seems like it is one of those coffees that is down the middle of the road.
1;"""I use many Newman's Own products and I was glad to see Newman's Own Coffee K-Cups. I use K-Cups and I like bold coffee so I tried Newman's Own Bold. I  really like it. It makes a strong cup of coffee. I drink this round the clock"
1;I normally drink the donut shop k cup. I've tried pretty much every k cup that can be found in stores. My mom pretty much forced me to check this out and Im glad she did! The taste is strong but not bitter. This has become my go to k cup when I need a coffee pick me up in the morning.
1;"""This was the first coffee I tried on a Keurig.  At first I wasn't a fan.  Then I tweaked the cup size a bit and found a nice blend.  I personally like this on the 10oz setting.  This gives the best balance of flavor and fullness.  The key here is this is a medium roast"
1;"""This tea is incredible. Mind you I  am not an avid tea drinker. I'm more of a coffee person. I bought this tea to alleviate stress and deal with irritability. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it tastes wonderful too. The aroma in itself is calming and the lavender and slight anis flavors are just incredible. It combines the benefits of great flavor"
1;"""My anger/tension/irritability is off the scale and I have been trying anything and everything to help myself calm down. I have been using the calming and bedtime teas for the past 2 weeks and I have to say that even though I still get quite mad"
1;"""Bedtime Tea Is the  icing on the cake  for me.  It has become part of my bedtime ritual now.  It adds just that little 'extra' that my system needs to sleep more soundly.  I have to tell you that taking two 'Calcium-Magnesium-Zinc pills are crucial for me.  The magnesium really does calm down the nervous system"
1;I have been drinking this tea for several years. It is great when you feel Stressed. Within a few hours of drinking it makes me feel in a relaxed and peaceful state of mind. I highly recommend this tea.
1;"""This Yogi tea flavor doesn't really have the strong flavor like Peach Detox or Women's Energy just to name a few. This tea has the Lavender smell. OMG! The fragrance can linger for a long time in my mouth and throat after drinking this tea. Just make me feel so good and calm. YES! Just soothing and relaxing. My 70 year old mother who is usually picky on her tea choices"
1;I love this tea!!! Im an engineer and seemed to be quite wired with thoughts every night.  I take one cup of this and I'm immediately relaxed and ready to go to bed!  I've even hooked my hisband in this tea.  It has become a part of our nightly ritual.  The six pack is a great deal too!! In stores you will pay $4-$5 dollars a box!  We also had it set up to deliver automatically every 3 months so we do not run out! This method also saves you an additional 15%!  Buy this tea off amazon and save 50% over in store prices!
1;"""This is fabulous and it's what we drank when traveling in Cancun every morning. I just found it in our grocery and was thrilled to have it. I put the tablet in the blender and pulverize it (do one at a time"
1;"""Real Mexican chocolate of any version will be much better than mass produced American chocolate simply because the cocoa content is much higher (as w/ European chocolate). This is REAL dark chocolate w/ a little spice and sugar. I do not think it requires any additional sugar when I make it since I want the dark chocolate flavor. I use a whisk and it comes out delicious. I think this is one of the best products Nestle makes and about the only one I consistently purchase. In fact I'm going to try the powder mix version for convenience"
1;"""From Nestle comes Abuelita an excellent hot chocolate for those Fall and Wintry days.  This is sugared dark chocolate with a hint of cinnamon.  Each box comes with six tablets.  The best way to serve is to heat four cups of milk"
1;"""When it came to hot chocolate my beverage used to be swiss miss.  But after one cold morning of moving a hot tub I was rewarded with Abuelita.  This hot cocoa has tastes of cinnamon and other spices.  I like to add a bit of cayenne or chili powder to it"
1;I love this hot chocolate  !  this is just a great drink -- the first couple times I made it I didn't do it correctly and it didn't so good --  You have to nuke the bar of chocolate for 30 seconds in microwave  - and you have to put in blender -- so all ingredients blend  -- if you don't you will have a chalky and that would be sad  --  what I have learned is  put chocolate in microwave --  put your milk in sauce pan and warm it up  -- add chocolate and stir  --  when the chocolate melts put into a blender or I use immersion blender to get all spices blended  --  yeah and then you have the best hot chocolate in the world --  how can you go wrong with big beautiful piece of chocolate ?  all other hot chocolate drinks are kind of boring compared to this  --
1;"""I like to powder it to add to my lattes. I first discovered it when going to a local LA coffee house where they made Mexican Hot Chocolate and Mexican Mochas. Yummy! So I started making them at home with my espresso press and blending the chocolate in my milk and adding it to espresso. Whola"
1;"""I bought some for my 86 year old aunt who has severe sinus/post nasal drip/allergy. It gets so bad it keeps her up sometimes with the coughing and exhausts her. She uses so many medications trying to get some relief"
1;This tea works just as it should.  Taste is a bit strong but a little honey goes a long way.  I use this to help with chest congestion due to allergies and use to use it when I had asthma for bad days.  You'll need 2-3 cups a day when your chest is very tight.  Otherwise 1 to 2 works great.  This is also a great buy as they tend to be $6.00 a box in the store.
1;"""I have never been a believer in any herbal teas until a coworker gave me a mug of BREATHE DEEP tea with honey last winter when I was coughing a lot.  Even one sip brought relief to my throat and by the time I had finished the mug"
1;This is a product that I have used when I lived in NY state.  I loved the Pussy Cat Mix but use this now from a receipe that the company gave me.  I cannot buy the any Bartenders mix here in Arizona so I am delighted to be able to get it through Amazon.  The service is great.  I forgot to mention that company is not making Pussy Cat Mix any longer.  All good things come to an end.
1;This mix is so good and so versatile that you can make multiple types of drinks.  It is great replacing the water with ice cubes and blending.  The frozen drinks this make is fantastic.  I would never use anything else
1;"""My mini schnauzer loves her G.I Bone 3 . It is just the right size to put in her mouth without worrying about choking. She was able to get the filler out within 3 minutes. The bone has lasted several months. Also"
1;I have this Oskri Coconut Original on subscription order and I truly enjoy it.  The size of the bar gives one just enough without over doing on one serving.  I do not want to be without it in my house.  Just enough chocolate to make the little bar perfect.  I do keep it refrigerated whether it is necessary or not.  If you like coconut and like chocolate -- go to it.
1;These bars are delicious! They're soft and chewy and mildly sweet.  I actually like sweet bars and was wondering after I read other reviews if these would be sweet enough. They're perfect! I love coconut and was hoping to find a yummy snack-sized bar to enjoy. These are fresh-tasting and delicious! The price is worth it too because they taste like a quality bar.
1;These snacks are such a great finger food.  Unlike a lot of other snacks for toddlers we have tried they actually taste good.  My only problem is wanting to eat them before I give them to my daughter.  They are not messy and are the perfect size for little fingers.  The fruit melts very quickly in my daughters mouth and is so easy for her to eat.  All the flavors are excellent but this is our favorite.  Both the blueberries and apples taste fresh and sweet but with no added sweetener.  Great job designing a healthy snack for young children.
1;"""Little  Duck Organic products are the best finger food. I am so happy I found them for my daughter. I was looking for organic freeze dried fruit for my daughter and just couldn't find anything that wasn't overly crunchy and hard to chew or that didn't get stuck to my daughters teeth when she ate it. Then I found the Little Duck products"
1;"""I am so done purchasing ANY and ALL other fruit snacks for my 3 and 1 year old now that I have found Little Ducks ! I was given a bag from my friend Stephen in NC.  He told me that they were the BEST snack nutritionally and financially for my little babes.  I opened the bag and started sampling them myself.  I wanted to taste what I would be feeding my children.  Before I knew it"
1;"""Enjoying a cup of coffee is not a great option for me because I only enjoy it with a lot of high calorie creamer.  I have been buying the Gloria and Green Mountain original hot chocolates because they are only 1 WW (Weight Watcher) points.  However"
1;"""I have been trying different types of green tea to find one that is not too overpowering and where i can still reap the benefits of drinking green tea.  this one is it.  i put a packet of splenda in the equivalent of 2 1/2 cups of tea and even when i steep for up to 30 minutes (i get sidetracked when getting ready for work in the mornings) it is great"
1;"""Just read the previous review which stated that Quaker was using high fructose corn syrup to sweeten the cake.  Maybe this was true at the time they wrote their review but as I have the pack in front of me"
1;"""This juice is one of my baby's favorites. I used to buy the 4oz bottles but this is way cheaper. I like the fact that 4oz gives her a serving of fruits. The max amount of juice that babies should drink in a day is 4oz"
1;Received item very quickly. I didn't try it until just lately for grilling season. Mixed it with a few other spices to make a rub for steaks ... oh so good. I have used other cheaper smoked hickory salts ... this has much more flavor. I just used it on Steel Head trout with some butter and garlic and dash of lemon ... mmmm good.
1;I have tried several dried apple brands available in bulk online and at warehouse stores and so far these are the best.  I prefer slightly soft dried apples.  Other brands have been too crunchy or filled with sulfide preservatives.
1;I was very pleased with Cool Capp Double Mocha Iced Coffee Mix. I felt it tasted like the iced coffee I get at Gloria Jeans when I am at the mall.  I also like the Big Train Iced Coffee mixes.  I have saved so much money making my own iced coffee at home.
1;I HATE ALL FORMS OF DIET SUGARS!<br />THEY ALL HAVE AN AWFUL CHEMICAL TASTE WHICH IS ALWAYS TOO SWEET<br />i FOUND THIS ERYTHRITOL I WAS SOOO HAPPY TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT TASTED GOOD IN BOTH TEA AND COFFEE WITH NONE OF THE GUILT OF REGULAR SUGAR!<br />TRY IT I THINK YOU WILL LOVE IT!
1;I have ordered these for several years for my husband as a special Christmas gift and they are wonderful. He looks forward to getting them every year. Fruit is plump and moist and chocolate is delicious.
1;"""I ordered a couple of tines of these dark chocolate dipped glazed apricots.  They were totally delicious.  My only dissapointment was the presentation. The apricots are not in individual paper/wax cups"
1;These brownies were easy to make and tasted great!  It's hard to tell they are gluten-free because they don't taste like it.  And I've never seen them offered so cheap as on Amazon.  I highly recommend them.
1;This mix is easy to make and tastes delicious.  It is moist and chewy.  It satisfies those that eat gluten as well!  My second favorite brownie mix is by Authentic Foods and all the others I have tried and would not make again - they went in the trash can.
1;"""The top of the frogs have a slight lime taste and are like big gummi bears. The white bottom is a foamy sugar similar to marshmallow. The combination has a nice feel to it when you're eating them. They're also great for sticking to your friend's forehead"
1;Just looking at the bag of these yummy frog candies makes my mouth water. I love these frog candies and always added them to my candy bag when at the candy store. I like them a little less fresh when they are harder and chewier. I just love to gnaw on these things and chew them and taste them and eat them. I can end up eating so many of these and not even realize it so a 5 pound bag for me might be a little dangerous. I love the white bottom that feels like a tough marshmallow. The texture and taste is delectable. Highly recommend these.
1;"""We received the Haribo Gummi Frogs in the stated amount of days. The product was very fresh and enjoyed by young and old at my son's grad party. I placed the frogs at each table in small bowls. He was part of the FIRST Robotics team-FROG FORCE"
1;I don't know about you but I usually like to chew the head off mine first.  Can't really stand it looking at you while you are eating them you know.  The ones sold here at Amazon are fresh enough that you can get a clean teeth cut.  Imagine a thick green apple gumminese intense in flavor floating on top of a soft white pillow of mashmallow.  Glad that you can get it next day for $3.99 more don't you?
1;"""I have these on Subscribe & Save and they do not come often enough.  I ate these when I was a kid living in Germany and they are still as good as I remember them being.  I have ordered several bags and they have always been consistently good"
1;Our family loves these gummy frogs! They are so fresh and soft when you open the bag. They don't even have time to go stale...we finish them off long before then. And the price is fabulous! We have automatic delivery every 2 months (though my kids wish it was more often). Highly recommended!
1;I had garlic prawns for lunch and had to go to a meeting afterwards. My girlfriend offered me some Eatwhatever and I have been hooked ever since. This stuff is amazing. Completely gets rid of that really smelly breath that even brushing your teeth can't fix. I am now addicted.
1;The Ribena 1 Litre Case of 12 was packed well and received in a timely manner.  Very happy with this concentrate.  Nice and strong which means you only need a little bit with water.  Worth every cent.  In American shops we haven't been able to find any cordial concentrates and was really missing it.  Thank goodness for Amazon!
1;During the time I lived in England I became aware of this product and was pleasantly surprised when I found it on Amazon. I continue to purchase and consume Ribena when a fresh light refreshing drink is needed after a hard day at the office.
1;Our dog (a Shih-tzu) LOOOOOOOOVES Crunch Cards!  They entertain her for weeks and she loves to gnaw on them more than any of her toys.  I couldn't find them locally so I was thrilled to find them thru Amazon.  I ordered half a dozen and should last us @ a year!  Seller shipped so quickly!  Very pleased with the product and with the service!  Thank YOU!
1;"""I had seen Nutella in the States growing up but didn't really become a heavy user until I lived in Europe for a year. This stuff is amazing - it's super chocolatey with a hint of hazelnut that gives it a really full-bodied"
1;"""I am in love with this hazelnut spread made with skim milk and cocoa.  Grownups and kids both enjoy and it's a nice way to get picky eaters to consume whole grain breads.  Don't let the healthy breakfast commercials fool you"
1;Used this to make blackberry sangria that taste exactly like Carrabba's served. Absolutely delicious. All my girlfriends love it. Great for tailgating. Nice because the recipe is on the bottle for a pitcher or just a glass.
1;"""I ordered these from amazon after being without them for years. Our local health food store stopped carrying them. I am so glad that the company has not changed the product at all in that time. Same wonderful flavor I recall. My husband"
1;"""These are sooooo good! Addictive. Just know they're not CARROT chips/fries (actual fried carrot slices) they're carrot CHIPS - think POTATO chips (actual fried potato) vs corn CHIPS (cornmeal fried chip"
1;"""The first time I tasted this Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate was in a restaurant in Southern Colorado. It was a cool rainy day and I was in love with it after the first sip.I have never tasted anything this good. I took down the name of the product"
1;So chocolaty and spiced just right! I decided to try this brand after reading all the wonderful reviews. I'd never had spiced hot chocolate before - just the plain store-bought instant kind. WOW! The flavor of this just blew me away! Best cup of hot chocolate I've ever tasted!! I'm hooked!!
1;Love this stuff.  It has one of the best combinations of chocolate and mexican spice flavors of any I have tried.  I used to live near a bookstore where the cafe made mochas with this cocoa and now I buy it at home for the same purpose.  It also works really well to add a little spice to your cookies.
1;"""This awesome mix is not your usual Hot Chocolate so if that is what you are looking for do not buy this product. But if you are looking for a chocolate that tickles your senses then you definitely want to buy this. The first time I tried it I was not sure so I drank some more"
1;We discovered a cafe that had excellent Mexican mochas about three years ago. They were expensive but we didn't visit that often. Then we discovered this was the powder used to make the mochas. It is all natural and tastes great. It is really rich and has nice spicy undertones. This is the cheapest way to purchase it in bulk.<br /><br />Now we make our mochas at home with an espresso machine and steamed milk. This also is loved by our children for hot chocolate.
1;"""I cannot believe how good this is! I am a peanut butter by the spoonful w/ a glass of milk kind of girl and have been dying ever since I started Weight Watchers two months ago. I just heard about this and saw all the great reviews and they are all TRUE! It reminds me of natural peanut butter if I add a drop less water and don't stir it until really smooth. It is HEAVEN! Can't wait to make peanut butter toast"
1;PB2 is amazing!!! I was a little worried about trying it and I must say I was so pleasantly surprised. We have been using it every night in smoothies (peanut butter/banana) and it is so good. I've even tried it on a sandwich. The taste is pleasant. It tastes more like an actual peanut. I would definately recommend.
1;"""This stuff is great because of the fat and calorie content. It still contains some protein like normal peanut butter which is good. Normally I would say that the added salt and sugar isn't neccassary but in this case it definetly is because without it it woud probably be pretty gross. As far as the texture goes don't expect it to be like full fat peanut butter as the texture is sort of  gluey  but not unpleasant. I like to eat it on toast or with red grapes."""
1;"""I got PB2 powdered peanut butter for mixing in with my morning shakes. I absolutely love it! It tastes great and mixes in great with no clumps. I love 2 T for 45 calories as opposed to 200 in regular peanut butter. It says you can mix with water to make a solid peanut butter"
1;I have always wanted peanut butter to have alot less calories. I LOVE peanut butter and this tastes GREAT and I'm helping my weight loss at the same time. I  think this is super and anyone wanting to try this you should.
1;I love this powdered peanut butter.  My boyfriend and I are peanut butter freaks so we were a little skeptical.  It takes exactly like regular peanut butter but with out all the fat and calories.  I use it with my Body By Vi shakes to make the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup recipe.. but you can use it anywhere you would normally use regular peanut butter.
1;This is really hard to get to the right consistency for use as a spread. But for cooking! WOW! Thai peanut sauce with a fraction of the fat and calories! I don't really bake but I could see a lot of uses there. Tastes just like roasted peanuts. Will buy again.
1;I was impressed. It smells like peanut butter & has the same consistency as peanut butter. It really doesnt have much taste to it. The chocolate pb2 doesnt either. Theres a slight taste of peanut butter but I'm not sure if I'm tasting it or just smelling it. I love it cause it offers a protein without all the calories. Btw the calories as well as other values are identical in the plain & the chocolate. The real challenge is finding something to eat it on. Better on a cracker than bread. Best on toast
1;85% less fat - a bit too good to be true? Couldn't find this on the shelves in Canada.  Been searching for it since first showcased on the Dr.Oz show.  I bought about 10 jars intending to give it to family and friends (especially those who are mindful of their caloric and nutritional intake) as part of their Christmas gifts and am RELIEVED to find it tastes good!  It will be well received by my family and friends.  I have only tried it as a spread and look forward to using it in smoothies.
1;"""I add this to the Body by Vi shake mix. It's helped me lose 20 pounds of fat and gain 6 pounds of muscle. I love Body by Vi and P2 just makes it taste that much better. I don't know how they do the p2 and I don't know how they make the Vi-Shape taste so good"
1;The price stinks horribly especially if you have to pay for shipping but thankfully we've got prime so it makes it a little easier to swallow the price. I use PB2 for my protein shakes and oh man does it kick up the taste and makes it even sweeter knowing Im not getting all the fat and calories as you do in regular premade peanut butter. It's always a wonderful alternative to use in peanut butter cookies. The kids NEVER know the difference either.
1;"""This product is awesome! I decided to buy from Amazon instead of the manufacturer because I wanted to try one jar before buying 4. It is a really good PB Substitute. It doesn't have the exact same texture as peanut butter"
1;I add this to cookies & cream whey protein or chocolate or with banana to vanilla whey and make a great tasting drinkable drink.  Only drawback is the price and availability at a store near where I live.
1;I love this peanut butter. It has 25% of the calories of regular peanut butter and tastes great with a good texture. Don't make it up ahead unless you put it in the fridge.  It will spoil but lasts days if refrigerated. I buy it from netrition for less than 6 dollars a jar with a six dollar shipping fee for my order.  Also very fast shipping.<br />With most things amazon is a better deal but not in the case of some of these less common food items.
1;"""I have been using Bell Plantation for 3 years and think it is a God send. It works perfectly into the Weight Watchers program giving you all the taste of peanut butter without the caloric cost. Because it is powdered you have the option of making your peanut butter thick or thin. I think Bell's has a great peanut butter taste and I feel good about leaving out all of that artery clogging oil. My three children like Bell's 10years old"
1;I've been eating better for a year and lost 70lbs.  I was looking for new ideas and found this.  I have used so far in my morning protein shake...just a 1/2 to 1 teaspoon is plenty.  Really great flavor.  I will buy this again.
1;"""I didn't buy this so I can mix it with a liquid and create my own fat free peanut butter. I only bought this to use in green smoothies and protein shakes and for that purpose this stuff is great. I get that nice peanut butter taste added to my smoothies or my yogurt without all the extra fat and calories. I haven't bothered to try eating it plain mixed with water and don't plan to either.<br /><br />I would definitely purchase it again"
1;I am a peanut butter addict and I absolutely love using this in my daily protein shakes. Flavor is delicious and it is more than half the calories and fat. What more can you ask for?! Awesome healthier alternative. I have not tried it in a sandwhich yet though.
1;I added two tablespoons of it to my chocolate protein and vanilla soy milk with a few slices of bananna.  It was delicious.  Tasted just like my smoothies with regular peanut butter. It cut out 160 calories and 14.8 grams of fat.
1;Can't live without peanut butter and now I don't have to. Great peanutty taste without the over the top fat grams. The powder mixes with a little water and spreads on bread or whatever way you like to eat peanut butter. Anyone on Weight Watchers or any weight loss program should try this product. It is just ground peanuts with the fat removed!
1;This product is an excellent addition to my morning protein shakes. I have used this product every morning for the last 45 days in my chocolate high protein shake to give it a Peanut Butter Chocolate Treat to it. Sometimes when I am craving a nighttime sweet dessert I use chocolate protein with the PB2 to create an amazing dessert to curb my cravings. This works great especially for those watching what you eat and trying to lose weight.
1;This is the best product ever. I used to put regular peanut butter in my chocolate shakes and it would stick to the blender jar. Just add a tablespoon of this powder in the jar and blend away. It is fantastic.
1;Pb2 adds tons of flavor and protein to my Herbalife protein shakes without all the fat of regular peanut butter. It's a great product. I started buying it by the case because others in my family also like it!<br /><br />Pros:<br />85% less fat than regular peanut butter...yes 85% less! I know that's amazing!<br />Great taste!<br />Easy for me to take along when I travel (which I do a lot)<br />A good source of extra protein without a lot of extra fat<br />Love it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />I can't think of any!
1;I'm on Weight Watchers and saw this product being used in many diet recipes.  It is fabulous and only 2 WW points + per 2 T.  Frozen banana mashed with PB2 is like ice cream.  Can't wait to try more recipes!
1;"""I decided to try PB2 after hearing a couple friends talking about it.  I'm so glad I did. PB2 has a nice peanut flavor without all the fat and calories. I add it to my weight-loss shakes for a little extra flavor.  It's also good stirred into muffin or pancake mixes"
1;"""This is amazing stuff especially with Amazon Prime. PB2 + APO + Amazon Prime = almost like home. It taste better than real peanut butter and there are endless recipes to try!<br /><br />I use this in my shaker cup with Chocolate Shakeology"
1;"""I've been buying this product for the last 4 years and have never waned in my love for it. Not only is it much more convenient than jarred peanut butter (MUCH easier to spread/prepare and bake with especially) but it also tastes better to me"
1;"""Dont go into this thinking after you mix up your peanut butter that it will taste like what you are familiar with. It wont. This isnt laden with the sugars and oils that give most store brand peanut butters the flavor people are familiar with. In fact"
1;"""I tried this PB2 after reading about it in the Hungry Girl Cookbook. I was amazed at how wonderful it was. You can tell that there is no oil in the product so it is a little less creamy than real peanut butter. I LOVE peanut butter"
1;Love Love Love this stuff! Perfect in protein shakes! If you are in love with peanut butter but not the calories this is the product for you. I love to add a scoop in my protein shakes.  It makes the shake creamy and taste JUST LIKE a big scoop of peanut butter.
1;I bought this mostly to add into protein smoothies for some extra PB flavor without all the fat and calories. It works perfect for that! 2 tablespoons of this added to some protein powder in a smoothie tastes just like I've added regular peanut butter.  I've also tried mixing one tablespoon of PB2 with one tablespoon of water and it also tastes pretty good (though not quite as rich as regular pb). The consistency comes out just like peanut butter and you can use it for sandwiches or dipping.
1;I bought PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter to mix in with my protein shakes.  It tastes like regular peanut butter at a fraction of the calories.  Using this cuts around 150 calories out of my shakes and leaves all the taste.  2 tablespoons is only 45 calories with 5 grams of protein.  2 tablespoons of regular peanut butter is around 200 calories depending on the brand.  I'm definitely gonna keep this stuff around.
1;"""I appreciate those science geeks out there who spent the time to create a process to take 85% of the fat and calories out of peanut butter!  Who knew that was even possible?  PB2 makes it very easy to add protein to my oatmeal"
1;I love this product. It is nice to get to enjoy all the great parts about peanut butter with none of the bad nutritional elements. I like to enjoy peanut butter but I don't want all the extra calories. Flavors are great.
1;I was excited to mix this right away.  Reviews are saying smoothies and such but there is no limit to what you can cook with this amazing powdered product.  I feel as though the home cook has just been given a token!  A secret ingredient in one's pantry.  Begin by adding it to indian dishes.
1;I am so addicted to peanut butter. I eat it every day as my breakfast with an apple to dip into it. This peanut butter is so good and easy to make. All you do is add some water into it and basically you choose the consistency. It tastes amazing and I couldn't be happier with it. I'm so glad i ran across this product!
1;I have only used this product to make my peanut butter smoothies. My husband loves pb smoothies but was skeptical about trying this powdered version. He said he couldn't even tell the difference in flavor and then was more impressed that it was 85% less fat! I only ordered one jar because I didn't know how it would taste but plan on ordering a lot more as well as other products like the cookies really soon!
1;I've been hearing about this product on Hungry Girl.  I love peanut butter but not all that fat that goes along with it.  This stuff is amazing....so creamy and peanutty. I also like the portion control of just mixing the amount I need.  I gave one of the jars to my Mom and she loves it too.
1;Yum Yum - this stuff is good!  Perfect for adding to protein shakes or greek yougart or just add water for a delicious dip for apples and celery. You can use it as a dry dip for banannas too!  Has made a wonderful addition to my meals and helps keep me on track with my reduced calorie diet.  I love peanut butter but don't miss (or the higher calories) with PB2.
1;"""I was a bit skeptical about this powdered peanut butter. When I tried it I was pleasantly surprised by it! You mix 2T of powder with 1T of water to make a paste. The texture is about the same as the texture of a natural peanut butter"
1;I found this product at a grocery store that I don't usually shop and was thrilled my find.  I had been considering this product on amazon and had been contemplating ordering it.  I am quite glad that I picked it up.  It tastes great in oatmeal!  I am happy with this product because peanut butter is one of my all time favorite foods but has been cut out of my diet due to the high fat content.  I recommend giving it a try.
1;"""Needed something to add to my protein shakes (vanilla) besides strawberries.  I have heard about this product but was hesitant on if it actually  tastes  like peanut butter.......UNBELIEVABLE taste!! Tastes EXACTLY like peanut butter!  Buy it.  You won't regret it."""
1;"""Oh my goodness!!! This is the best!!! It has passed all the tastes tests in our house and beyond. I have been handing it out and now I am ordering more!!!!! Everyone is getting one for Christmas. You will not be disappointed!!!!<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GJ9JWS >PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 6.5 Oz</a>"""
1;"""After reading the reviews (and trying the walden farms calorie free kind...gross!) I didn't have very high expectations for PB2. I was very happy to find that it was much better than I thought! I am a peanut butter addict"
1;"""I am always looking to keep my calorie/protein/fat ratios within check to get the most nutritional bang for the buck. This is by far one of the top 5 finds for my smoothie arsenal. With 45 calories per 2tbsp"
1;"""Someone made mention on the WeightWatcher message board about this PB2 product. I<br /> ran  right over here and read all the reviews and ordered a jar.  I took everyones<br />critique.  Love it!!!  I mixed 1 T. in a pinch bowl and gingerly added water to the right conistancy and added 1 t. of good jam. Wonderful on WW toast.  Afterwards I was sorry I didn't add a sliced banana. There is always tomorrow!<br /><br />I recommend that you visit the Bellplantation website as they have many recipes and ideas.  Which is helpful because this is a new concept.  Can't wait till lunch!!!<br />You can buy this product over the counter but it would be a two hour trip for me.<br />Try it you will like it as I have tried all the  other  peanut butters before."""
1;"""I heard about this product from Hungry Girl.  It is great to use as a lower calorie substitute for regular peanut butter in recipes.  I love to use it when I make a chocolate peanut butter milkshake using frozen yogurt"
1;"""I saw this in a segment on a television show about foods to try if you want to cut fat and calories. I decided to try it by first ordering a small jar. It is very easy to mix (two TB powder with one TB water) and this  makes two TB of  creamy peanut butter and is only 45 calories. (I think REAL peanut butter is about 190). I was amazed  and very pleasantly surprised with the authentic peanut butter taste and consistency. Two TB is plenty to make a sandwich or a topping for another food. I even had my husband try it"
1;PB2 is a GREAT product.  I love peanut butter but I don't love the fat so I never buy it.  PB2 is a powdered peanut butter to which you just add water.  You can add a little less or little more water depending on the consistency you want.  It tastes just like peanut butter but has only 45 calories for a 2 tablespoon serving.  What's not to like?
1;"""I have been on Weight Watchers since June 24th of this year and have successfully lost 35 lbs. The one thing I missed was peanut butter!! It is very costly on the weight loss system that Weight Watchers established"
1;"""This is great stuff!  You can use in place of peanut butter in lots of ways and the calorie difference really helps the waistline!  The flavor is just like peanut butter - I sprinkle on top of a piece of toast with fruit spread and it tastes like peanut butter and jelly!  Also use it in wraps for a  thai  flavor and in smoothies - yum!"""
1;"""This was recommended to us from a friend at weight watchers as a lower fat peanut butter alternative. It works very nicely for that: Mix with water and you've got yourself a spreadable peanut-butter that's much lower in fat and pretty satisfying.  But we've also used it a couple other ways that have been fantastic.<br /><br />Making chocolate covered peanut butter balls (Buckeyes): Use some of this instead of powdered sugar to increase the peanut flavor and reduce the oversweetness of some recipes.<br /><br />Take a teaspoon of it and add to chocolate ice cream.  It's excellent.<br /><br />This is a great product not only as a low fat peanut butter option"
1;This is awesome stuff. I'm a weight watcher and this is an excellent subsitute for creamy peanut butter. You can do anything with it. It has an awesome fresh peanut taste. Makes a great apple dip and really good peanut smoothie without all the fat and calories. Will for sure buy again.
1;"""So I ordered this upon a colleague's recommendation. I figured I would at least try it out. I was extremely surprised at how good PB2 tasted. I am a Reese's and Jif (creamy) fanatic and this is definitely yummy. I strongly recommend this if you are looking to lose weight or watch your caloric intake"
1;Love this stuff.... i use it for my afternoon snack .. on a slice of ezekial sprouted grain bread and sliced bananas.. 2 tbsp powder is plentiful for a sandwich and at only 45 calories.. vs 200 calories!
1;The product was received in a timely fashion.  I am enjoying the whole nutmeg a great deal.  I feel that the freshly ground spice is so much more flavorful then what I buy ready ground in the store.  I have always enjoyed nutmeg and so with this freshly ground whole spice I get the full flavor of it.
1;Nuts are large and fragrant. They won't last too long as I use about one a week. Convenient way to shop as I live in the middle of nowhere.  Make sure you have plenty on hand for home made eggnog this holiday season.
1;"""These are actually very tasty little gummies and my little boy loves them. Make's a great treat. Quite a few fit into the package and they are decently sized as well. The gummi center is actually solid though"
1;"""I'm always trying  new types/brands of coffee. I found this one about 3-years ago.  It now is one of my favorite flavored coffees. I've served this to several of my friends and most all of them have liked it. In fact 4 of them now buy it on a regular basis. So"
1;"""We loved this!  We ordered it for our Christmas dinner so we wouldn't have to slave over a hot stove.  They both warm up in about an hour.  The turkey was so moist and very flavorful.  The ham was just delicious.  With our kids<br />taking left overs home with them we ended up eating every last morsel.  I will probably make this an annual tradition and maybe even order it for other holidays as well.  It arrived within days"
1;"""I have a Boxer with a sensitive stomach. We could never figure out why she was getting sick so frequently until we thought it could be a meat allergy. So we switched to this vegetarian dog food and her stomach issues vanished. She loves it and she feels better"
1;I bought this in the hopes of extending my culinary skills to include Mochi. It is actually quite easy to make with this flour. I was pleased that the containing bags were sealed properly and not dumping the flour all over the shipping box. Always a great thing.
1;After having only 2 previous Assam teas I can say this is without a doubt the best one I have tried yet. The price was the deciding factor when I purchased this and I am not displeased. I would recommend this product without hesitation.
1;Just received and made last night.  Very good tasting.<br />This 16oz bag is a lot of tea - more than I thought. Glad I have though.<br />Nice packaging -- but will put in tins because of the amount to keep it fresh longer.
1;"""This tea is a very great substitute for coffee. I found it about five years ago as a recommendation from a friend and have been drinking it since. It has a great flavor and versatility. I like mine strong with a couple teaspoons of honey"
1;"""Good flavorful tea.  Organic and tasty.  Stands up to some milk or to drink plain.  I love loose leaf teas and this is an easy way to find a good one.  It's nice to have it come in a 1 lb bag.  The bag is a self closer zip lock one"
1;I love this tea  --  I have been trying Davidson's teas --  I like just plain unflavored teas -- This is great value too -- It has a smooth taste  - It makes a great iced too --  This tea has a clean simple taste to it  --  I have tried other types of Assam Banaspaty Estate Tea and this has a very good taste to it ---  I have hot water brewer that gets the perfect temp and it helps tea brew correctly  --  If you love loose tea I would invest in hot water brewer --  because it does make a difference in taste of the teas -- there is no guess work on temp -  I am really enjoying these teas from Davidson's  !  I highly recommend to a friend  --
1;"""I have been purchasing this tea regularly for a couple of years through Amazon's subscribe and save program. I have never been disappointed with it's quality. I am not a tea snob nor connoisseur of fine teas"
1;the pack did not last long!  they have none of the strange texture or flavour of most gluten free snacks. not as OVER THE TOP AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS as the ginger ones but still fab. they aren't cheap but they are worth every singe cent. we shall certainly be ordering more of these.
1;"""We had a friend come to stay with us for week.  We found out she ate Gluten Free just days before she arrived.  I quickly got onto Amazon and found various products I thought worth giving a try.  She LOVED these cookies!  THANK YOU!  Unfortunately"
1;"""This food saved my sanity and my dog! after trying dozens of holistic foods and countless vet bills I have finally found the one dog food that doesn't give my dog projectile diarrhea!!  and after a lot of experimenting I believe its the legumes because I have try several other grain free limited ingredient forms from NB and this is the only one that works I still mix it with pumpkin because it is the only thing that has given him solid stool"
1;"""Although this is very expensive canned dog food we found it well worth the cost.  We own a Golden Retriever Saluki mix that is extremely particular about what she eats and she rarely accepts canned dog food. However"
1;I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR 2 1/2 YRS FOR A FOOD TO COME ALONG THAT DIDNT MAKE MY BEAGLE...GAIN WEIGHT...CHEW HER FEET NONSTOP...LICK HER PAWS NON STOPO...HAVE A WHITE INSTEAD OF PINK BELLY..SHAKING HER HEAD FROM ITCHY EARS ALL THIS FROM ALLERGIES FROM ALL THE EXTRA YAK THEY PUT IN ALL THE DOG FOODS NOW....I CAN FINALLY...STOP SEARCHING!...THIS IS THE ULTIMATE BEST FOOD THERE IS..

I BUY IT FROM HERE ON AMAZON CALLED ANIMAL ESSENTIALS ITS THE BEST THERE IS..ITS POWDER ITS FLAVORLESS. AND OF COURSE I GIVE LIQUID FLAXSEED OIL (I BuY HERE AT AMAZON too borleans)THE BEST FOR THEIR COATS AND SKIN...USUALLY THIS TIME OF YEAR (SPRING & SUMMER) THEY GET BALD FROM SHEDDING SO MUCH AND MY COUCHES WERE LOADED WITH HAIR!! NOT SO AFTER GIVING THIS FOOD (ALL FLAVORS OF THE WERUVA) AND THE SUPPLEMENTS I GIVE...THEY HAVE SOO MUCH ENERGY I CANT BELIEVE THEY WERE ALWAYS BEING COUCH POTATOES SLEEPING ALL THE TIME....NOT ANYMORE  :o)  I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOOD FOR YOUR BABIES (WELL U KNOW PUPPIES/DOGS& cats) LOL YOU FEED A LOT LESS TOO BECAUSE ITS ALL NUTRITOUS NO GARBAGE IN IT...YOU CAN TELL A GOOD FOOD WHEN THEIR STOOLS ARE VERY SMALL FIRM AND HARDLY ANY SMELL.

UGH...SO SLIDE YOUR CURSOR UP AND CLICK ON...BUY  :o)  AND YOU WILL FEEL SO GOOD KNOWING YOU ARE GIVING YOUR PRECIOUS COMPANIONS THE BEST!
1;My first experience with this sauce was a purchase through Costco in Jax. Fl. They no longer carry it and I'm very disappointed. Obviously they never tasted it or they wouldn't have gotten rid of it. I put this sauce on everything but chicken is the best and even my morning scrambled egg omelet. They also sold it in a 32 oz jar for 6.99
1;"""I was literally not prepared for the exquisite and lively flavors that this brew offered as it instantly became my favorite Rooibos tea. This organic Rooibos makes the perfect daily cup of tea that can be enjoyed in any quantity. African herbal tea is rich in many essential natural elements as it is not allowed to oxidize making the flavor more fruity and literally weightless. This tastes like a cross between soft black and green tea"
1;safe and tasty treat.i would assume these are like puffed cheetos for dogs. popeye loves them and i get a kick out of hearing him actually crunch and chew instead of woofing down his treats whole and risk getting choked...plus i think these melt in his mouth if the peices are too small for him to crunch.
1;I had a bag of these during a trip to London. I was looking for Walker's Frazzles but this was the only bacon-flavored chips I could find at the Tesco. The taste is very similar to Frazzles if not better. It tastes just like bacon! Even suitable for vegetarians.
1;I had these wonderful chips in Ireland a few years ago on vacation and was sad that I could not find them in America.  Now that I have I will be in so much trouble ordering them all the time.  I love these chips!!!
1;"""These are the normal sized packets that we all know and love.  Good ol' Regular flavor so it doesn't have all that extra sugar and stuff.  I use 2 packets and about 3/4 cup water.  Just boil the water first in the microwave"
1;"""I first tried this tea at my Naturopathic Doctor's office waiting area.  It was soooo good!  I looked for it at our local supermarket chains but they only had the Egyptian Licorice herbal tea (minus the mint).  While that one is good"
1;Man I love this salt.  I swear even compared to other premium sea salts there's something special about this stuff.  I have been using it exclusively for a year or so now and have even given it as a gift along with good peppercorns and olive oil and my friends that aren't foodies were really surprised at what a difference good salt makes.<br /><br />Not that this matters but I see this salt being used on Iron Chef America frequently.
1;I love the texture of this salt - I use it in place of kosher salt for finishing food because it looks great and has a wonderfully irregular texture. Perfect for sprinkling on salted caramels or other sweet salty goodies.
1;"""Maldon salt is acknowledged to be the most elegant salt made. Irregular flakes make it ideal for finishing although it would be something of a waste to dissolve it in cooking. The flakes provide a 'surprise' when you encounter them"
1;I bought Maldon Sea Salt after a friend mentioned how good it was.  I can't believe the difference between it and other salts.  The crunchy texture and the clean taste makes it perfect for everything from steak to a baked potato to desserts.  It is and will be a permanent fixture on our table from now on.
1;It was delivered very quickly. I bought this because it is grain free - my dog however didn't care for it - I think the kibble is rather small and doesn't have the aroma that other salmon based foods do.  We are donating the remainder to the animal rescue group
1;"""We've been looking for a way to obtain greaat anchony flavor that only anchovies can deliver. The cans are so expensive and you waste most of it as you only need a smidge of anchovy flavor to pick up any ssauce or pizza. My honey says she doesn't care for anchovies"
1;"""I love giving these kits as gifts to my friends and clients. It's a great housewarming or hostess gift. Plus you support a great organization that employs and trains people with disabilities. It's a win-win! <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007O0KABS >Prairie Spices Gift Set</a>"""
1;I have used this brand potting mix now for 3 seasons and had no problems at all. It is the only potting mix I use now and I've seen no signs of any form  of bug. I do get it in the bigger bags but I'm not sure that would make a difference.
1;Packaging was excellent.  Candy arrived in perfect condition.  So very fresh....I have never eaten a kit kat this crisp and fresh.  In my time I have eaten my fair share of kit kat candy.  So I have to say this was a very pleasant transaction.
1;"""This is my favorite  assorted  candy ever!  I SO wish they'd release white or dark chocolate-only bags because these are the treats I look forward to all year.  We scour the local stores around Halloween and usually buy their entire stock.  I love the KitKat crunch and each flavor of chocolate makes picking a favorite difficult.  (Which usually means I have to eat three at a time *giggle*)  I'm glad to see Amazon has them in stock in case I can't find them locally"
1;"""I like the portion size on this one.  Son started eating this at 5 1/2 months.  No issue with feeding him cold or hot he eats it.  I like the benefits of DHA and I like the listed Vegetables/Grains.<br /><br />I like the pricing"
1;My baby will not eat peas or green beas but he LOVES this - go figure.<br /><br />Don't rely on bogus 1 star reviews that criticize the fact that it contains fish oil which it clearly states on the packaging!!!!
1;"""I purchased a set of these salts to give as holiday gifts last year.  Everyone who received one of the blends continues to rave about it!  One evening a friend of mine brought over a black bean dip that she made from the recipe on the Artistic Taste website"
1;"""This product has made my life easier and more delicious.  I use the salts in my everyday life and for entertaining.  I get home after a long day and rub the Himalayan Pink Island on some fish and have great flavor on a healthy dish.  When I am being more indulgent"
1;I have a Bichon Frise and for the longest time feeding was nothing but an endless hassle for me.  Both my dog and me would be completely stressed out because he couldn't find a food he enjoyed and I was buying tons of food that he would just stare at for hours and refuse to eat.  One day I went into a local pet food shop and they had sample packages of all the different types of foods they had and they gave me several to try out. I took them home and set them all out for my dog... he went around and sniffed at all of them but this was the one he finally went for.  A couple years of using this food later and he never seems to protest.  Thanks for making my life easier.
1;My husband loves chocolate and Lindor Truffles are his absolute favorite!! He loves the rich smooth chocolate with the creamy filling and the variety of flavors. This order was a Christmas gift and they arrived right on time and in perfect condition. We will definately order again.
1;I love the flavor of Cardamom and this brings out the best of it.  I have had plenty of raw almond butters and I have never had one blended so smoothly with such a great balance of flavors.  I am so happy this company exists.  This has led me to purchase one of each of their products.  All of which have impressed me.
1;"""This is a terrific product and about as healthy as you can get.<br /><br />If you're a bit ambitious you can also make your own brown rice flour at a much lower price by grinding up uncooked brown rice in a powerful blender (like a Vitamix in the dry container) until the right consistency. Use the pulse mode"
1;These crackers are amazing.  I absolutely love them.  Anyone who trys them will never buy another cracker.  The quality is outstanding.  I am Italian and these crackers taste just like the crostini that my mother used to make when we lived in Italy.
1;I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY SMALL DOG WHO WAS HAVEING JOINT PROBLEMS WITHIN A FEW WEEKS SHE IS NOW DOING GREAT NO MORE LIMPING GREAT PRICE AS WELL. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A JOINT SUPPLIMENT THIS IS A GOOD CHOICE.
1;"""My dog LOVES these treats whatever flavor they may be.  These are her favorites and very healthy too. <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0ZJHW >Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats"
1;"""I have an eldery dog with hip and joint problems. We have been using Zuke's for a little more than a month and have seen and amazing improvements in her. She loves the way the treats taste and goes crazy at the sight of the bag. She can now navigate stairs"
1;"""Our 10 year old lab mix started having problemswith his hip joints. He has always been an active dog and watching him lay around and not want to interact was hard to see. Initially our vet gave us Rimadyl to get him through the acute phase"
1;"""We've been feeding our Bichon Zuke's hip action treats for years.  He gets one each day after breakfast and expects it.  He has had two knee operations which was one reason we looked for a treat targeted for joints"
1;I have a maltese and she is 11 yrs. she was limping and I took her to the vet. They said she might have cancer on her leg and probably need to cut off her leg.<br />I didn't have the money to take her back to the vet to check up again when is was crying in pain. So then I read others reviews on Amazon and found Zuke's. I immediately bought it and gave her 2 doses a day for a week. And now she is running around the house ans jumps again. My dog doesn't like the taste but I sandwiched between the sliced cheese and she eat it with no problem. Thank you so much Zuke's. From now on I will buy every month for her.
1;I read the reviews and was dubious but my dog had stopped walking up the stairs and not jumping on the chaise to sleep at night. I started Zuke's Hip Action  a little over 2 weeks ago. Yesterday for the first time in months she came upstairs during the day while I work in my office. And today she jumped on the chaise for a nap.  I figure there is no placebo effects for animals so that can't be it. The treats must have had an effect on her mobility and pain. I will be a repeat customer.
1;My dogs love the flavor of these.  I have tried both the chicken and peanut butter and they go nuts.  Though I will admit the peanut butter has a less-intense smell than the chicken for human noses.  I can see the difference in the dogs' coats almost immediately!  I highly recommend any Zuke's products.
1;"""I have a 5 month old Pomeranian puppy.  Poms have a tendency to develop collapsed tracheas and also have issues with luxating patellas (knee problems).  Both areas are made of cartilage.  I give him one of these per day to make sure that we strengthen his cartilage/joints so that we can try to prevent or delay these issues that may develop later (and hopefully some vet bill money down the road!).  He loves these things and the chewy texture of them (I must admit"
1;I was not sure if I was giving my lab the treat to make me feel better or if it would really work. She is running more on our walks and has an easier time getting up from her naps!!<br />Great product plus she loves the taste
1;"""Mz Sparkle loves these and I was working out of town and couldn't find a place that carries them.  It was so easy just to order them from Amazon...I had gotten the Prime membership for kinda the same reasons...new city and difficulty finding my  go to  purchases.  Sparkle was delighted."""
1;"""I have an elderly dog with hip and joint problems. She has been taking Zuke's Hip Action Dog treats for a little more than a month and there has been a HUGE difference in her. She loves the way the treats taste"
1;"""I rescued my havanese dog from a breeder who was going to put her down for a hip deformity. Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy. It caused her immense pain when moved in certain positions and caused her to limp. Running fast was out of the question and jumping was only for the lowest of heights. Even when she sat her left leg would be out to the side at an awkward angle. She was stuck in a catch 22. She couldn't make it stronger because it hurt and it hurt because it was so weak.<br /><br />We tried glucosamine supplements"
1;"""Both of my dogs love these treats! My border collie has been having problems with stiffness in her back legs so I thought I would give these a try. I have been giving them to her everyday for about a month and just last weekend she racied me down the stairs outside!!!  And she won!!! I really think these are helping her"
1;"""Very happy to see a product that actually backed up what they said about the flavor.  Have purchased other products that stated they were  bacon  flavored and dogs love them.  Couldn't get my dogs to eat them (one of them usually eats anything).  I have no problem getting my dogs to eat the Zuke's Hip Action Natural Dogs Treats.  I've noticed a slight improvement in their movement.  Haven't been using the product that long so it will be good to see how their movement improves over time."""
1;"""my two dogs absolutely LOVE zuke's hip action dog treats!  it's so great to finally find a  treat  that's not only beneficial to their health as well as them really liking the way they taste ~ i only have to give them each two a day ~ my dogs have a combined weight of 185 lbs.!  most  treats  recommend feeding a lot more making it kind of expensive ~ the price is right and maya & luna are happy!  i will definitely be ordering on a regular basis!"""
1;Only the best for our little guy!  He loves them.  I pack a few for our hikes and they seem to give our 10 year old LAB that extra boost that he needs!  I can see the difference in his energy when we run out of them so I try my best to keep them stocked.  They seem to help him!  Amazon is the best price around.  His favorite is the Peanut Butter!
1;"""What can you say about Zukes PB Hip Action treats that hasn't been said already? My dog loves peanut butter and these treats are full of peanut butter as well as 300 mg of glucosamine and 50 mg of chondroitin which keep her 6 year old joints flexible for those long hikes and swims.<br /><br />And Zukes donates a portion of its proceeds to the dog & cat cancer fund every year and makes all its products wheat"
1;These are great dog treats that are made with natural ingredients and my dogs love them.  I give them these treats to provide the Glucosamine needed especially for my larger dogs.  They get a very good grain free dog food but it does not contain glucosamine and my older dog needs it. Zuke's Hip Action really seems to help her. I have brought this item for several years and highly recommend it.
1;Zukes Hip Action are great treats for our dogs. Our Lab/Shep mix was already having hip troubles at 5yr. old when we found these treats. He LOVES these and is running around like a pup! Thank you Amazon for selling these at such a great deal. We would have paid about $20 for one bag (2 bags for just under $40) and here we got 3 bags for the same price!
1;"""I have been buying this product since sep 2010.  My dog loves this the most.  He sometimes refuses other treats but never this.  So it must be good.  It comes in one and a half inch squares.  It's a little big for us so we cut into smaller"
1;My lab loves anything Zukes. He will do almost anything for a piece.  I'm happy knowing it contains glucosamine because he is still young large breed and walks up and down stairs. It also smells good and is easy to break apart for training.
1;The vet recommended we give our dog Dr Zuke's Hip Action and it was difficult to find in this area so we were pleased to locate it on Amazon.  Our dog loves the taste of the moist chicken flavored squares.
1;"""I read the other reviews before buying.  But this cup really has whole berries in it and large chunks of peach.  I was amazed!  Great flavor and texture.  Very easy to prepare and my selective 4 1/2 yr old ate it all up!  I just wish it had less sugar.  Given that any person who makes this cup will eat it all most likely and thus has 2 servings or 18grams of sugar!  Way too much"
1;"""I started a weight loss program and began incorporating this drink.  So far so good.  I have a can of the orange flavored drink (much better thanthe other flavors in my book) with oatmeal and fruit in the morning for breakfast"
1;The carbonated version of the orange Celcius drink is the perfect drink for first thing in the morning.  It starts the day off on the right foot.  I have been drinking a half can of celcius each morning for a couple of years and as long as I can get it (Amazon is the very best place to buy) I will keep starting my day off with Celcius.
1;Celsius sparkling orange has a light carbonation and light orange taste which I love!<br />It is like an energy/metabolism booster drink combined with vitamins and minerals. I drink one every day.<br />Amazons subscription plan is the most cost effective way to buy!
1;"""I do my workouts in the morning and this celsius flavor is definitely my  workout partner . It tastes more like ginger ale then an orange drink. I have tried a bunch of flavors but this one is my favorite and it's easy to find elsewhere like publix"
1;I have been a energy drink fan for a long time taking the good with the bad. That is no longer necessary with Celsius! It truly is the ultimate fitness partner. I have tried all the original flavors and plan on trying the new ones very soon. It seems to me there are flavors for everyones liking. My favorite so far are sparkling orange and peach mango green tea. Both are enjoyable and rewarding with the results I get from drinking one a day. They are the major reason i'm back in great shape and can perform at the highest ability in anything active. [...] If your looking for the edge to get you out of the fitness funk one a day is all it takes.
1;"""I recieved this oil last week and it is rancid. It smells and tastes like rotten tomatos or avacados and there is no way I could eat this on any type of salad. Both cans arrived in perfect condition and neither are near the expiration date on the bottle. I recommend purchasing from a local retailer so it can be taken back if its rancid. Its too much of a gamble buying from Amazon when you cannot return food items. Lesson learned.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/05/2011: After reading so many reviews about how good this product was I contacted La Tourangelle through their email system and told them about the situation and asked how this avocado oil was supposed to taste. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to taste the way it did or not. I didn't ask for replacements or anything because I know a lot of companies will not back their product if sold by Amazon. That is not the case with La Tourangelle. I was contacted by Diane through email about a week later asking for the batch numbers. I gave them and didn't hear anything back"
1;Love this oil. Use for everything from cooking to cosmetic use. Makes a great (out of the sun) moisturizer for my face and a wonderful hair treatment oil. But I just found a website that sells in larger quantities for a better price. Example: They charge $24.15 for a gallon and $11.65 for shipping. That's less that $40.00. Where here you pay for more. Don't know if I can put up the site.....but it is located in Tucson AZ and search for avocado oil bio genesis. Please let them know if you are buying for cooking or cosmetic use. I buy cooking and use for both.
1;"""I still can't believe this isn't sold at my local supermarket. We use this oil on virtually everything! Baked chicken tenders taste like fried with a little spritz of this stuff. It gives everything we put it on a buttery taste that so isn't butter. I have bought 4 units"
1;"""I wonder if someone started listening to the reviews on here of dented cans? Mine was shipped in a box with air-filled bags inside of another box with a ton more air-filled bags. No dents.<br /><br />I purchased this oil for two reasons. One"
1;"""An excellent product! ... and this particular brand seems to be better than others I have tried in the past. It has a very fresh flavor and can be used in a large variety of ways. It is pure and very tasty when used just as an oil on salads or vegetables"
1;I bought this oil for my hair.  I've been swimming a lot and the chlorine has depleted my hair form its natural oil. The avocado oil added the shine and softness back to my hair.  All I do is wet my hair and towel dry it.  Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of avocado oil to my intensive repair cream (I use moroccan oil brand repair cream) put it on my hair and either sit under a hot cap or leave it overnight.  works wonders!!!! I grew up eating and using avocado for beauty treatments...I used to mash up avocado and put it on my hair...I like the oil better...less messy.<br />I am also cooking with it.  The popcorn comes out so much better!!!! LOVE IT.
1;This oil has a very light flavor. I love it on my salad more than olive oil. I use it in the frying pan for cooking and it has a high heat point. Great price and now I'm hooked on this healthy avacado oil.
1;"""I have been using La Tourangelle Avocado Oil in 'everything' since receiving my order couple weeks or so back. I like not strong olive oil (usually like the buttery kind from late ripe olives). I tasted some of this avocado oil alone and it is a bit stronger than  buttery  olive oil as it does have a bit of a 'bite'. I still do like it"
1;I think the packaging is just beautiful - like a gift tin. I've been using it as a skin moisturizer (sometimes I mix it with aromatherapy and coconut oil so it doesn't smell like avocado oil) and I've seen a reduction in my stretch marks.
1;I have used this stuff throughout my senior year at college and absolutely love it. Now that I am a bit older and have a serious job this stuff really saves my life. I get really bad hangovers but Party Armor has now made my mornings much more manageable. Stuff really works!!! Changed the way I drink. Thanks guys.
1;This was bought to be used in our wedding and we couldn't be happier. We have a ton of tea left over and we have been enjoying it. The flavor is good and doesn't taste as though it has been sitting in the boxes for a long time. Twinings is a great company and we have often had their tea in the past and we will probably continue to get it in the future. The box of 6 is a great way to get the bulk you need without paying a ton.
1;The tea arrived as advertised.  It was a gift for my parents who love to have tea.  They do not like any Herbal varieties. Twinings tea is always good and this selection of teas (non - Herbal) was perfect for them.
1;While having the twinning earl grey flavor decided to write the review as I felt it deserved one.Great stuff.Better than the other brands I have tried so far.Does a better job than Tazo awake to make you feel fresh.Will certainly order more...
1;"""This variety pack was my  nice to meet you  handshake with Twinings teas. It was about time that I tried the brand! I cannot in good conscience say anything about the English Breakfast or Irish Breakfast"
1;"""Green Tea is amazing! I was first exposed to it while stationed in Okinawa many years ago. At first I did not like the taste because I was used to that cheap orange pekoe Lipton junk I grew up with. But after a day or two"
1;"""This has been my favorite tea for more than a decade but I can't find it locally. I had been ordering directly from Twining but placed this order with Amazon because of the free shipping for orders over $25.00 which saves me at least $1.00 per tin. Saving a buck is always exciting to one of Scots descent and since I drink a pot every day"
1;My sister had this sent to me as a birthday present. I enjoy a good cup of tea and this did not disappoint. Delicious and strong green tea. Only wish the package was bigger so I could enjoy more of the tea.
1;"""My husband and I absolutely love this tea! It tastes great especially with a drop of honey and it is very relaxing. I have asthma and allergies and sinus problems ... and this tea sort of calms my whole respiratory system. So"
1;These jelly beans are great tasting and give you good energy. Do not expect to run 10 more miles or lift 100 more pounds. But it does give you a good enough quick burst and they are good to suck on while perform activities.
1;"""If you try to buy tea in one of our major cities and are approached by some limp-wristed purveyor trying to sell you one of his  artisanal  blends packaged in a paper bag with an attractive or colorful label"
1;I have such a hard time finding loose tea locally. Being able to order my favorite Lady Grey tea on Amazon is convenient and timesaving. The tea comes in a six-pack of tins that are just the right size to insure continued freshness. Speedy shipping too!
1;Shipment arrived on time and in good condition.  Most retail stores don't even carry Lady Grey.  All I have found is the sample packs with maybe 2 or 3 bags of this delicious mix of tea.  It was truly a great deal for the price. Highly recommended!!
1;"""I just LOVE this tea. I am a very picky tea drinker and this is the only one that I currently drink. The loose tea tastes so much better than the old tea bags. I highly recommend it.<br />I drink my tea steamy hot with a little bit of milk"
1;"""Twinings developed this tea last year (2006) for their 300th anniversary - a counterpart to their famous  Earl Grey  product.   Lady Grey  has the distinctive Earl Grey flavor but with just a hint of floral.  It has become my family's favorite tea.  We can no longer get it in our stores but is easily available on-line from Twinings.  Buy it - maybe we'll get it back in our stores!  A wonderful product!"""
1;My favourite tea in loose leaf form... it just doesn't get any better than this.  The tins are a good size (not so small that it's gone after four cups of tea but not so large that it'll be stale and moldy before you could possibly finish it) that fit nicely in my desk at work as well as on the counter by the teapot.  The tea is fresh and flavourful with the quality I've come to expect from Twinings.
1;"""The first thing you notice when you open a tin of Twinings Lady Grey<br /><br />(beside the redolence of bergamot oil mixed with the aroma of black tea and lemon which is a staple of the *Earl* Grey Teas) is the striking visual pattern of the loose tea:<br /><br />Dark dry tea leaves sprinkled with bright dots of dry orange peel and stunningly-blue cornflower petals.  It is almost as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds. Milder and less caffeinated than the Earl"
1;Easy to use and Great taste. Shippment came on date quoted. I take extras to where ever I go instead of drinking plain water I just put a packet in the bottle and have a refreshing beverage. Can't beat it price wise.
1;This is a great substitute for soda. It can be easily prepared before heading on a trip or just running errands. Tastes great with few calories. Save money and calories by taking this with you. Using a subscription saves even more. I don't run out and don't have to be worried that the grocery store has run out.
1;The Jimmies had purple in the mix.  That was exactly what I was looking for.  Since we are not planning on eating these (but throwing them instead of rice). I won't know taste.  But color is excellent!
1;Jimmies sprinkles are the best i love them because they are soft and unlike the other hard sprinkles don't get stuck in your teeth. lol But it was a great buy. You have a better deal here that anywhere else.
1;"""I'd started a long time ago purchasing this product from a local organic/natural food store.  I don't allow regular cheetos in the house because of what's in them and this one is allowed because of what's not. When you find artificial preservatives/flavor enhancers in food that's not good for anyone"
1;I actually haven't received my package yet from Amazon but found a bottle in the organic market yesterday and used it on my chicken breast. I thought it was pretty good and I need a salt replacement. I'm trying to lose weight don't need salt adding on to my weight. I recommend it !
1;First of all I happen to think this is delicious. It has no diet after taste as with most artificially sweetened sodas. Anyway the people who downward this are missing the point that this is NOT using poison to sweeten it. Stevia is natural. I have extremely sensitive taste buds and a sophisticated pallet and I can tell you that there's not much of a difference in flavor between say Sucralose(which is awful for you) and Stevia which is 100% safe.<br />So if u want to trash this and keep feeding you and your kids garbage and poison by all means. Google what artificial sweeteners do to the immune system. I used to be good for three colds per year and two sinus infections per year. Since eliminating all artificial sweeteners(from drinks gums candies etc they sneak it in everything now. Start reading labels) I have not been sick ONCE in 4 Yeats since eliminating it. So I'll stick to Blue sky when I choose to have a soda. It's delicious.
1;"""I can't really describe how this works or what it does to me. I drink it and then for about an hour or two I get a good mind focus on what i'm doing. I buy a ton of this product around finals. This is the best price I've found and I like it enough that I took the time to see if I could find it cheaper. It's about $3 for one at the store.<br /><br />ADDED: After writing this review I really searched hard on if this water contains fluoride. I found out it does if your on the east coast. If you dont know how bad Fluoride is for your brain"
1;"""I use this more for herbal uses than cooking.  I take it daily as an herbal supplement (plain) by the spoonful (wonderful taste).  And I use it to make infused oils to make herbal healing salves once the herbs have soaked in it (infused) for a week or more"
1;I purchased the Branston Original Pickle for my mother as she does not eat dill pickles and being from England she remembers the great taste.  This is the first itme I have ordered Branston but will use this seller again when my mother runs low.<br />This Jar was well wrapped in bubble wrap before being shipped to me in a strong box that arrived without any damage.  I received my box well before the expected date.  This shipper is excellent.
1;"""Since I discovered this wonderful relish in England a few years ago I have tried to buy replacements in this country. It is served at most pubs in the UK as part of a Ploughman's Lunch along with various cheeses and other goodies. It has a wonderful taste and texture"
1;"""I learned to love Branston Pickle when I was working for Laker Skytrain in England many years ago. I am American but have become very fond of English food and traditions. Now I have my source for the future"
1;"""I fell in-love with this product when I was in England with my boyfriend.  And once you have had a sandwich with Branston in it....you'll never want to eat a sandwich without it!!!!  It is so delicious!!!  Wish that they sold this product here in Hawaii...so that I don't have to pay for such a high shipping cost to bring it here.  However"
1;"""I learned about cheese and pickle sandwiches watching a British TV series on Netflix. At first I thought cheese and pickles would be awful! But it isn't pickles it's  pickle  which I guess means relish. Anyway"
1;I ordered 2 bags of this item and paid $12.50 per bag.  When I received it I saw it came from Trader Joes. So the next time I needed some I went to our local Trader Joes and paid $3.99 per bag.  Unbelievable!!!
1;"""I never used white flour much prior to becoming gluten free but there are some recipes that simply don't turn out as well with any other type of flour. One of those is dutch babies which turns out light and fluffy made with this flour blend:<br />4 EGGS"
1;This flour has me baking on a regular basis again since we went gluten free.  There is NO grit!  My GF son is a hard-to-please eater and he said the yellow cake I made was the best he's ever had!  You can't go wrong with this!
1;This is a great GF blend to use for those times you don't want to measure out a bunch of different flours on your own. It makes great cookies and other sweet baked goods you start to miss when going GF. I noticed a lot of the negative reviews were complaining about it not being plain coconut flour or having more carbs than they wanted. The beauty of this flour is it's made by a mom with a celiac daughter. A lot of us are just looking for a way to make our kids (or ourselves) the baked goods everyone else enjoys and this blend is an amazing substitute!
1;"""I buy Mrs. Butterworth's Original Syrup from Amazon.com for two reasons: I'm crippled and housebound and can have items delivered to my door---and Mrs. Butterworth's is great on pancakes or hot biscuits and if you gain a little weight"
1;I ordered this icing for my daughter's first birthday cake.  I figured it would look good but taste terrible.  It actually tasted good! It looked great and was very easy to spread.  I was very pleasantly surprised.
1;I love to cook at home and enjoy using a variety of spices. I also love camping but have not found the best way to transport spices (when I remember to pack them.) This little tin is awesome! It has several different spices that you tend to use all the time in individual packets. The one teaspoon pre-measured amount is perfect for small meals over the campfire.
1;I have been a strictly Bigelow earl grey drinker for years and for some reason it has not tasted as good to me lately. I wanted a healthier tea and I really really like this tea. It takes very little of it to brew a cup/pot (and I would also suggest 'Tea Forte' products for brewing).
1;"""First and foremost I am not a tea drinker. I've tried for years to like tea and every tea I've ever tasted was bitter or had some nasty after taste (some were just nasty from the get go). So when I had the opportunity to taste this tea I said why not"
1;"""I bought this at a local store on clearance and was really pleased with the quality. It is far better than the tea bag varieties I have tried such as Twinings and Stash brands. I'd place it slightly higher than the Twinings Aromatics"
1;In my estimation there is nothing better than Rishi teas. I have been a tea drinker for 60 years and have tried them all. The Rishi Earl Grey is unparalleled. I treat myself to a pound of it regularly!
1;I was drinking Stash loose double bergamot earl grey and needed more... I tried this on a whim and I LOVE IT... There is tons of bergamot flavor.  This really is a very delicious tea and I won't be buying any more Stash.  This is all I need.
1;"""This tea punches you in the nose and then dances on your tongue.<br /><br />Open the can to a strong and distinctive bergamot aroma. The flavor is less intense. Well balanced and complex but still hearty with a wonderful lingering aftertaste.<br /><br />I love that you can brew the same leaves multiple times"
1;Loose tea is the way to go and this brand is no exception. Lots of flavor and the packaging seals in the freshness very well. It's not cheap- but you get what you pay for. You will not be disappointed if you are a tea drinker and enjoy not being locked into using tea bags.
1;"""Reading the label was an experience in its self.  Great information about the location of the tea trees and the culture around their 1600 year existence.  The tea leaves are appealing to the eye and the hand.  The aroma of the bergamot is strong yet light with a apple"
1;"""Rishi is a wonderful tea company.  They are one of the best of the best.  Earl Grey is no exception when it comes to their line.  It starts by being double sealed to retain freshness and aroma and doesn't stop there.  It is a premium black tea with just the right mix of bergamot for a crisp"
1;"""The scent upon opening this can of loose Earl Grey Tea is delicious in and of itself but once brewed....it's amazingly scrumptious!!  I like tea but I've tried a lot of varieties and brands only to find many have weak flavors (despite their initial scent) or are bitter"
1;I have to agree with many of the posters below. Earl Grey is my favorite tea and I have tried every brand I have ever come across. I was completely floored by how good this tea is. It is absolutely the best Earl Grey I've ever had and that includes some pricey gourmet blends. And what a bargain: 3 tins for less than $20! Don't waste your time with anything else.
1;"""This product from Ye Olde England is simply the best condiment for accompanying lamb roasts. It has a very delicious upfront mint tang as opposed to those icky-sweet plain mint and apple/mint jellies most of us are accustomed to having with our lamb. Forget those mostly corn syrup and  mint flavored  concoctions and opt for this traditional English condiment. As I said it is tangy and sweet all-in-one. Mostly because it is just mint leaves ground into a delicious paste and some vinegar and sugar added for just the right combination of flavor. A perfect addition to the mildest to gamier cuts of lamb. Try it"
1;If you use the Dolce Gusto machine Amazon is the place to buy the coffee. You'll get the best price and super fast shipping. And if you setup a subscription for the coffee you'll even get a better price!
1;"""As the product description says this is the perfect  all day  flavor for a wonderful tasting cup of coffee. It doesn't matter if you need it as your morning  go juice  or an evening coffee. You will be doing yourself a disservice if you don't give this one a shot."""
1;I like this coffee because it's intense since i don't mix anything with my coffee i like good quality of coffee to enjoy purely it's aroma.. I like the fact that the machine makes a little foam and it raises it's texture a little bit to my favor. i simply love it!
1;I have a Dolce Guso coffee maker and I LOVE it.  Unfortunately in our area the most we can buy are flavored coffees.  Thank you for handling the coffee's for my machine.  Our favorite is Lungo and Espresso.  We have several cups a day.
1;"""OH MY GOSH! I JUST ATE A WHOLE CAN OF THESE YUMMY POTATOES! I HAD BEEN GETTING CONCERNED ABOUT NOT EATING ENOUGH VEGETABLES AND FOUND THE NATURAL LIBBY'S BRAND. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT AND AM NOW PLEASANTLY SURPRISED! HEAT IN MICROWAVE WITH A LITTLE BUTTER"
1;.. as good in summer dishes.<br /><br />Have been using all Libby canned goods for over 40 years. From Midwest the heart of their growing area. All products are top quality 4 sure.<br /><br />One very easy Au Gratin recipe - rinse very well - drain well - mince or dice - layer in Microwave dish - season 2 taste - NO salt if adding cubed or shredded ham - then a layer of shredded cheese of choice.  Cover and Microwave approx 1 min. HI - enjoy.  Serves 2<br /><br />Another - drain and rinse well and add last 30/40 min or so to any crock-pot/slow cooker recipe. Sirloin or chuck Beef strips/Boneless Pork slices/ Serves 2/3
1;these canned potatoes are very good there a lot better then I thought they would be. I bought theses to use in stews and pot roasts or whatever else I'm making. it sure is better then pealing potatoes when I don't have the time will be buying these again.
1;These are my little shi tzu dog's favourite treats. They also keep her teeth clean and breath fresh. But Walmart stopped carrying the small ones. I am so glad to find them on Amazon...and thrilled at the price. I bought 4 packages!
1;I had to switch to decaf coffee because of the supervised diet I'm on.  I tried other brands of decaf which had little or no flavor. Then I tried Baronet Decaf Colombian coffee pods and it tastes like fresh brewed regular coffee...not decaf. It is bold and delicious. Now I don't mind being on my diet since I don't have to give up delicious tasting coffee!
1;I really enjoy this product. It is low calorie/fat/carb for sauces. I use it to flavor & thicken soups as well as use over pasta and vegis. I most often use extra virgin olive oil instead of butter with a little lowfat milk and it tastes great! I won't be without it! Highly recommended!
1;"""I bought this seasoning at a local store and now I can't find it... Lawry's told me it's a new product and I would have to buy it off of the Amazon.com site.  I'll have to be patient I guess because it's not available here either it looks like!  This seasoning is fabulous!!  My husband is not fond of chicken and he really likes it!!  I like chicken and am on a low-carb diet and this fits the bill!! If you're in an area where you can buy it"
1;I received this product in record time.  I tried it once and ordered again in bulk and am hooked.  Love the product and the company is excellent as far as packaging and the swift arrival time of my purchase. I would recommend to all my friends.
1;"""What kind of wife would I be if I didn't have some of my husband's favorite foods to serve at his birthday (this Tuesday) and Christmas?  Since he is British Thanksgiving is rather overlooked as a major holiday for him.<br /><br />As we live in a rural area a trip to an Internationally stocked grocery store is like a trip to the moon"
1;"""Our dog Callie loves these bones and she's VERY picky about flavours(only chicken). It's nice to give her something to  chew  on for awhile. They last a long time and are not smelly or greasy.  The price is reasonable and come in quantity options."""
1;Great results and no funny after taste. This product really helped and worked quickly. I bought it because I was having a difficult time pumping enough to provide bottles for daycare. This definitely solved the problem.
1;"""First the delivery service was great and arrived a few days before the estimated time. The package was in good condition and my children liked the taste. I think it is one of the best alternatives to peanut butter with added nutritional benefits and allergen safe. Unlike regular peanut butter exerted to high roasting temperatures producing unwanted free radicals"
1;This product is very good for stir fry and also is great for spaghetti!  There are none of the long list of preservatives that you see on other products.  You know what you are eatting - rice and water only.
1;My wife and I bought these online after struggling to find either the noodles in a store or finding fresh noodles.  We use them for one of our favorite recipes for Pad Thai.  We were pleasantly surprised how much better our recipe tasted using these fresh noodles.  Good luck to all chefs.
1;My husband is gluten-intolerant and we love these rice noodles as a substitute. They hold up well to boiling and we've used them for everything from spaghetti to fettucini to stir-fry. Even my kids love them.
1;I stopped buying noodles from the local asian market thanks to amazon!<br /><br />i use these noodles for stir fry as well as soups such as pho. they cook easily and taste great! the price is very reasonable.<br /><br />thanks amazon!
1;This is one of my favorite gluten free rice noodles.  They work so much better than most GF noodles because they stay soft even when refrigerated.  They're perfect for making cold noodles dishes.  I love them!
1;"""Pocket Coffees are something I  discovered  while assigned to an Air Force Intelligence Unit in southern Italy.  They are positively incredible!  It's a dark chocolate filled with espresso and a big pick-me-up.  We used them on the night shifts"
1;"""I was afraid I would never find it in the States. I don't know why I should be surprised I found it on Amazon. Parthenon Foods mailed it to me so quickly I think I got it the next day. It was carefully packed and with a cool pack"
1;Wanted to let those in the States know that yesterday I found these at Cost Plus World Market. They have a new shipment of old/new candies. Old as in olden days that are re made for us generation x and y'rs.<br /><br />I am now officially hooked on pocket coffee!
1;Speedy delivery.  Would definitely do business with again.  Love the chocolate too.  The espresso inside is rich and it's a real espresso liquid unlike those creamy ones that dry out over time.  Good kick of caffeine with you chocolate craving.
1;"""I searched hard and as far as I know no one else makes a candy like this.  chocolate candy with real liquid expresso filling.  I first tasted this pocket coffee in Europe in 2005 and was very happy to have discovered it on-line.  Almost gives the same lift as a shot of espresso and is a very tasty dessert.  Don't confuse it with the  Pocket Coffee To-Go  from the same source.  Also tasty but that is a pure liquid in a plastic cup.  Appears like that is the summertime replacement when it is probably too hard to ship a liquid filled chocolate."""
1;Was nervous about ordering this because one reviewer said it was not fresh.. We ordered two bags and no problem. Our rat terrier and my daughter's standard schnauzer love this food. They rejected several other brands and flavors before we found this food. Their coats are beautiful and they digest this product very well.
1;I ordered this kit for my 11 year old cousin as a Christmas gift.  She was so excited to get the pearl from the oyster.  My 27 year old helped her remove it from the shell.  She was completely mesmerized!  And it was a black pearl!  Such a nice set to give!  It was truly the hit of the party!  Her sister can't wait to get one when she is old enough!
1;I bought the wish pearl today and was told that theese are real pearls and that would be right!!<br />Every scalop is garronteed to have a pearl inside. The price on this modle is the same price for one at a store.<br />Each pearl has its own meaning white(wisdom)
1;"""I don't want to give away any secrets but I buy these treats for my 3 cats.  They are all addicted to them and ask for them after dinner.<br /><br />The dog treats are the same as the cat treats but at a cheaper price.  I was worried that they would be huge or something since they are sold for dogs"
1;My cats go crazy for this treat. This is the only cat or dog treat they will eat. They all mob me in the kitchen every morning and evening. My dog loves it too and will try to get it from the cats if I don't catch him first.
1;I used to buy these cheaply when I lived in WA State (they're made there) but these are cheaper than anyplace I saw there. Cat owners should just order the dog treats and split them up. These are a little large for most cats but if you break them down with a knife or box cutter they're every bit as good as the cat treats and much cheaper.
1;"""Uncle Lee's Green Tea is about on par with Tazo Green Tea.  They are the two best green teas I've had.  I agree with the other reviewer that it isn't bitter or stale like many green teas.<br /><br />I gave some to my mother and it has quickly become her favorite.  Now she knows that there are differences in teas.  She won't go back to Lipton and other big names.  Tazo green tea might just edge it out"
1;"""Far above any other.  Had grown tired of the bland brand names which are loaded with sodium to give them a taste.  Stumbled on while in natural food store and decided to try.  Wow! What a difference. Just a few months ago"
1;Our health care provider recommended eating 1 ounce of raw almonds daily to help keep bad cholesterol levels lower. We have tried many different brands and these are our favorites for several reasons. We like the fact that they are organically grown and that they taste fresher and sweeter than many other brands we have tried. We also like that the price is really good.
1;"""I love all the flavors of Zatarain's.  I love to cook cajun style food and will make my own from scratch when I have the time.  Reality means I usually focus on cooking the main course and will use boxed shortcuts for side dishes.  Zatarain's really shine in this role.  You give up surprisingly little for a ready mix product.  The flavors are within shouting distance of the real deal.  Compared to most foods made from a mix that require less than 2 minutes of your attention - it's practically a miracle.<br /><br />The Jambalaya and the Black Beans & Rice are the best flavors.  The Jambalya is hot and spicy - so kids don't like it.  The black beans & rice is a little spicy too - but subtle.  Mainly it's zesty and hearty and delicious.  My children eat it.  My little son just devours it - and has since he was a tot.  My daughter less so.  Actually I think I love this stuff more than my wife - so maybe there's a gender thing going on.  It's a little greasy when made properly.  I recommend using 2 1/2 cups of water"
1;i love this stuff. all you do is cook it up like the directions say then add what you want (i love sliced kielbasa)and dinner is ready. i don't have the patience for cooking and i'm not very good at it but my family likes this dish.  it has a little heat but my 3 year old eats and likes it. i cook up 2 boxes for my family of 6.
1;I came across Canidae when we adopted a 3 week puppy whose mother had transitioned.  We didn't know how to care for him properly so we went to the local pet store and they said Canidae was the food to use and to use it throughout his life.  We simply wet the food for the first few weeks before going completely dry and he has loved it throughout.  We also feed it to our 65 pound Goldendoodle and he loves it as well.  Definitely a great find.
1;"""I have a four month old st Bernard puppy and have always fed him and my 6 year old German shep hill science.  I did some research and found out how awful that stuff is.  I always thought expensive meant good.  Even my picky gs eats this with no canned dog food or any other incentive.  Of course the puppy will eat anything"
1;"""The adoption worker at our local humane society recommended this product because it is grain free and high in meat content.  Our dog loves this food.  We have a relatively small dog who is still in his puppy stage"
1;"""I have been using canidae for 5 years now along with nuvet vitamins  and it has been a wonderful product. After the ingredients change I have not noticed any sort of change in my siberian huskies what so ever. They still have high energy"
1;"""Although I have not bought canidae through Amazon (there is a local store near me that carries the life all stages 40LB bag for $35) I just wanted to write in and remark how impressed I am with this food.  I have an almost 2 year old chocalate lab.  When i got him from the breeder at 9 weeks he was on Eukanuba"
1;"""Canidae has been excellent for my dogs. My Siberian can be picky at times but they all seem to like Canidae. The company was open and informative with me.(1.800.398.1600) I'll not be feeding my dogs ANYTHING that comes out of China unless we go flat broke. Many foods(pet & people) say  Made in America  but most of the ingredients are from foreign countries and the food is only pressed together and packaged here. I consider this dishonest and immoral. It's also obviously legal thanks to federal policy that favors 'Free-trade/profit' over the health of American children"
1;"""This food is great. My German Shepherd does well on only 2 cups a day of the all stages formula.<br /><br />I've had a hard time finding it in my area as this is a smaller town. I am excited to see it available here but no where can I find out how much it costs to ship a 40lb bag?<br /><br />Amazon doesn't seem to have a  contact-us  option either"
1;"""After reading the book  Deadly Feasts  I was horrified to learn what kinds of items may end up in my dogs' food! I started researching different dog foods and consistently received the same brand recommendations: Innova"
1;Just bought a bag of Canidae with the new formula.  I had some of the old Canidae formula and am mixing in with some of the new formula.  The new formula has more meat in it and my puppy loves the new formula!  He jumped on it!  It's unfortunate that Canidae didn't announce that they were going to change the formula because it's making a lot of dogs sick due to the sudden change in food.
1;"""We are told to improve our diet. The same is true for our pets. You are most probably not aware what crap meats and fillers are used to produce the most popular name brand foods. They are expensive because of the advertizing. Canidae is not cheap either"
1;"""This food is amazing.  When I got my dog she was being fed Canidae.  I saw how clean her coat was and how healthy she looked.  So I went and got the cat version.  My big cat has lost weight and looks the best he has in years.  My little kitten is as healthy as can be.  She is now gaining good amounts of weight"
1;"""This is the best dog food I ever had<br /><br />I just adopted a Rottweiler Mamma Mia from the local pound and she wasn't in good shape<br /><br />her coat was thin and so was she<br /><br />her backbones and hip bones stuck out and she had dander<br /><br />now after a month she has a thick coat"
1;My nine year old Dingo used to get smelly after a month on IAMS.  It's been three months since his last bath (I just brush him) and no smell with Canidae!  My 6mo old Chihuahua was on IAMS for puppies but kept sneeking the Canidae from my Dingo.  So now he eats it too.  They scaf it down like crazy.  Buzz the Dingo's weight has improved without starving him.  This is the best dog food.  The price is good here although I buy it at the pet store.
1;"""My Dog is 10 Month now I wanna change her food to adult food.<br />We've been feeding her science diet big breed puppy food. but there is a problem is She doesn't wanna eat her food everytime!<br />so we've been feeding her food with her favoraite treat and my dog want me and my hudsband to stand right around her.<br />It was very hard to feed her everyday.<br />Today I got Canidae Food!<br />We fed her like canidae and science diet together.<br />My dog jumped on her food bowl that I held. As soon as i put down her food"
1;"""Good product. Our dog is older (almost 10 years) and this food has kept her healthy for years. Other foods make her sick to her stomach but she alwasy does well with Canidae. It's slightly more expensive at Amazon than locally but it takes a week for the local store to special order it"
1;"""Ok i have been through several dog food brands (all high end holistic fancy stuff)and have been through some ruff (lol) times finding just what works perfect for my  female Rhodesian Ridgeback. Now i wont bash any brands as some seem to do because some food seems to work with one pup and not another so dont be a jerk and think some food is crap because it didn't work out for your dog"
1;"""Pretty scary reading some of these reviews. I learned about the switch to new formulas from Canidae quite a while back but stuck with it. I have a German Shepard and a cat and both went through the switch just fine. What baffles me is how there can be so many great experiences listed here and then see those bad ones. I wonder if some of these innocent little dogs didn't have something else going on instead of getting bad food. Maybe it just doesn't work the same for everyone's dog. Anyway"
1;"""I used to buy one of those Purina brands for both my dogs which was fine at first. Then after a friend told me about this product I looked around a bit more and decided to give this one a try. If any of you own a pug"
1;"""I am a first time dog owner and wanted to ensure that my 2 Presa Canarios were fed a good dog food.  From my research Canidae dog food was one of the best listed.  In addition the  Grain Free  caught my eye"
1;This food has made new dogs out of our two small dogs.  Their energy levels and the quality of their coats both show a marked improvement within the first two weeks.  After one year of use we notice a marked increase in general health and activity.
1;"""My dogs have always been on a high quality diet and recently I decided to give this food a try. I was a little hesitant at first due to the price but figured my dogs were worth it. Since making the switch my rescue yellow lab has made vast improvements. No matter what she ate before"
1;"""I asked the breeder  why Canidae ? I never even heard of it. She told me that because German Shepards have sensitive stomachs and also prone to hip problems is why this product is so beneficial to their dogs. Ever since a puppy my dogs been on Canidae. I have tried others when I couldn't find Canadie"
1;"""My dogs started on Canidae 3 years ago. All of them had a dramatic change in energy and coat. They have done wonderfully on the food since. There has been a lot of negative attention recently with the formula change but I have yet to have any trouble with my 4 on the new formula. They continue to eat it and do well. They had no stool problems"
1;"""I bought this food for my adult male chiweenie and two female chiweeniepom puppies. I researched for a while before finally deciding to get this particular brand. I'm glad I did get this brand. My dogs absolutely love it. Before buying canidae my puppies were on purina puppy chow and my adult was eating kibbles n bits brand. They were  healthy "
1;Not only does my dog love the food but it got here super quick and just in time for me to have enough food for my dog for the next month in a half or so. I have an english bulldog and it keeps him slim and in shape. I have already ordered it three times and i will continue to order it as long as amazon has it. THank you and i would recommend it to people whos dogs are overweight and need natural food. with no by products etc. Your dog will be happy and stay slim to live longer!
1;I love this stuff! I blend up ice and throw some of this salt on it and squeeze some lime juice on and I'm set! I moved to San Diego from Oklahoma and couldn't find this product anywhere so I bought some from her and couldn't be happier!
1;"""Fish has that all important DHA that helps brain and eye development so I went looking for a baby food with fish. I was so excited to find WILD CAUGHT salmon in a baby food (wild caught salmon does not have the mercury content other fish have)! Plus it has other super foods such as lentils"
1;"""This has been my baby's (now 21 months) favorite since he was 10 months old. He seemed to be bored of it after a couple of months. My husband then was going to claim the rest of pouches as his snacks and started to have it with an Avocado"
1;"""My son is a little foodie and at 10 months has REFUSED to eat anything other then home made food. Lately I had started to become overwhelemed because I was coolong 3 different meals and I was worried that I wasn't making my son balanced meals. Insert Happybaby Super Salmon. Oh my god"
1;I have to give it to the makers of this line of organic baby food. This stuff is obviously high quality. It smells very fishy even though salmon is not one of the first listed ingredients. Again I was surprised but my little guy wolfed it down repeatedly. I was happy to find an organic fish food for my baby. Thumbs up.
1;"""I usually buy Sprout and thought I'd try this food since it got other great reviews.<br /><br />I am pleased with this meal.  It's a little less chunky than Sprout's stage 3 meals...so I worried a bit less about my baby gagging on it as he's learning to chew more.<br /><br />Also"
1;My daughter loves this food. This is her favorite of all the HappyBaby Organic Baby Food. I make all of her fruits and vegetables but decided not to continue this with the meats. She did great transitioning from the food I make at home to this packaged product so it must taste pretty fresh.
1;"""This stuff is so good I seriously almost ate it myself.  I don't know why people are saying that it is gross or bitter.  It tastes like ministrone (an italian tomato-based soup with pasta and veggies).  My 7 1/2 month old loves it.  He is a really good eater in general but actually makes little  mmms  when he eats this meal.  Definitely warm it up.  It is really yummy!  I like the suggestion to serve with Avacado.  We give him avacado almost every day and the creamy texture is a wonderful compliment to the tomato/acidic flavor of this meal."""
1;"""I have been making my son's baby food but needed a break since he's starting to eat more.  I only buy organic food for him and Chick Chick is one of his favorites.  I tasted it and it's a little bland for me but I'm also not a baby.  He loves it and as long as he does"
1;I was really worried about giving my 11 month old chicken or really any meat products.  I really don't like trying to puree meat so I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package and it actually tasted great and wasn't lumpy.  This was one of the only meat baby foods that when I tasted - I loved it!  I felt like I was giving my child a complete meal and it was organic!
1;"""My daughter loves Gobble Gobble.  I was a little surprised to see the reviews that said it is dry and tastes bad.  I wonder if those were bad packets.  The ones we've had have always been moist.  The food is a little bit bland"
1;Convenient packaging and the babies love it.  They just gobble it right up.<br /><br />This flavour is the best one out of the HappyBaby line of pouch foods.  The worst I would have to say is the Amaranth Ratatouille.  Chick Chick has a nice subtle flavour and nice texture.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
1;My twin boys both love this food.  It has the best texture of any of the HAPPYBABY meats we've tried.  The pieces of chicken and pasta aren't too big either.  This is great for babies resistant to texture--It has some but not too much!
1;These pouches were very easy to take with us and the baby just LOVED it! No leftovers here. I really like that they come in two protein varieties - chicken and a turkey! Great options and easy to take with you!!
1;"""Belle's Biscuits are fantastic.  My eight-month old granddaughter LOVES them.  They are safe and really ease her teething discomfort.  We freeze them to extend their shelf life and she enjoys them right out of the freezer.  Prepare for a mess"
1;This product is all but impossible to find in the local grocery stores in my area.  A friend turned me on to this treat several months ago and my family and I absolutely adore it!!  This is the second case I have ordered in about 4 months.  It has been used as a main dish at home and as a side dish for a large party.
1;yes solid white ALBACORE (key word here) buy it now/4lbs 2oz..<br />i could'nt believe my eyes when i saw this..it is like 13.00+ around<br />here where we live..<br />9.66 a can free ship no tax using subscribe and save and the<br />Save 15% when you enter code CHICKNC5 special right now..<br />unheard of pricing with free shipping and no tax<br />you can cancel subsribe and save at any time<br />excellent tasting tuna...for about 15 cents an ounce...<br />give the dog and cat some.<br />they do have the light tuna for less but it is not albacore<br />a real nice super tasty tuna for price
1;This is one of the best tasting black raspberry preserves that actually  have seeds. it is so hard to find real black raspberry preserves that have not been stripped down to a watery seedless jam that seems to be so prevalent nowadays. even some of the so called preserves that state whole fruit on amazon site are seedless and do not state it. Preserves have the whole fruit and seeds in general. otherwise it is a jam or jelly. so if your looking for the real taste of how black raspberry preserves should taste with seeds in it. this is a great tasty product. If you want seedless I recommend Clearbrook Farms on Amazon. But the best is Blue Ridge or St. Dalfour all available on amazon.
1;"""My boyfriend and I received the Keurig Elite brewer as a Christmas gift after lusting after the brewers all of my friends and family owned.  We have been using a trusty Cuisinart 10-cup drip brewer for a couple of years now"
1;"""My family uses the refillable baskets to make coffee in our Keurig Home Brewer. I found the K-cups weak and expensive and suspect most of them use dye to make the product look more like coffee.<br /><br />After about a year of heavy use"
1;I received this as a gift for Mother's Day. Had been looking at them but hadn't decided to purchase yet. I highly recommend this coffee maker. You can do two sizes and with the assortment of different K-cups available you could make a different type of coffee everyday. It is faster than I could have expected and the coffee is very good too. It was the perfect gift and I will enjoy it for years to come I am sure.
1;This is the most convenient and best way to make coffee when in a hurry or when you live by yourself. Also this coffee has such a large variety of coffee flavors where you will not get bored. And if you prefer to use your own grounds you can still do so if you buy the additional coffee filter accessory. All in all great coffee maker.
1;What magic I can preform....this coffee pot can do more then three cups of coffee of the time of my regular coffee pot does one....It is so much fun to be able to have a cup of coffee in the morning and not worry about leaving the pot on...and so quick...in about the time I get dressed it is made....lovely....
1;I have used this level of Keurig at home and in the office for years. The one at home has never missed a beat. The ones at work I've had to descale several times because of the constant heavy use but they are running fine otherwise. I just bought this one for an organization that I belong to and have ordered this model in the past for family and friends. You won't go wrong with this product from a quality standpoint. Best part is you get a fresh cup of coffee each time.
1;"""I bought this for my wife as a birthday present.  She absolutely loves it!  We love to drink coffee but hate the thought of having to make a full pot when we just want a cup.  The Keurig brewer solved that problem for us.  So when we want a single cup"
1;"""This product is SO convenient. It is so nice to wake up and just hit a button for instant coffee and have so many choices for a different cup every day. This particular model came with a coupon for a first time free box of K-cups! Which was a bonus. Only down side to this model is that there are only 2 sized of cups it can make and neither are big enough to fill a mug. Also the machine is noisy"
1;Can't say enough good things about my Keurig.  I like flavored coffee--hubby doesn't.  Problem solved.  Love a good cup of tea on a moments notice--problem solved.  A cup of decafe coffee in the evening--problems solved. Hot chocolate or hot cider for the grandchildren--problem solved.  The Keurig is everything I hoped it would be and more.
1;"""A friend offered us a cup of decaf after we had been out to dinner with him and his wife.  We accepted and enjoyed the coffee made with a Keurig very much.  My wife said to me  your birthday is coming up"
1;"""I have a different Keurig model at home and I absolutely love it. I would always make myself a cup of coffee first thing in in the morning and bring it with me to work.<br /><br />When I saw this model in a store"
1;"""Great product that brews a great cup of coffee fast and removable water resevoir is the way to go no more messy water refills with a pitcher or coffee pot.  Looks great with any kitchen decor and saves you money"
1;"""This is a great coffee brewer. Makes coffee quick and hot... no more stopping and buying a cup on the way to work and no more 1/2 pots of coffee dumped down the drain because too much was made. I have been using my brewer daily"
1;I ordered this on the first week of December and they said my package would come in on the 24th of December. It came in about 2 weeks early! I used it the first time on Christmas day and it worked great. I use it at least once a day and its been working great so far. Very easy instructions for setting it up and it brews my coffee very quickly. Thanks.
1;This is the exact noodles used for a main-staple Filipino dish (Pancit) I fix for my family every Christmas.  It's getting harder and harder to find these noodles in my local grocery.  I'm so glad I can find it on-line.  Thank you Amazon.com for making it capable for me to find.
1;We have tried a couple of different horehound drops and these are by far the best. They are like the kind we used to have when we were kids. They are good for sore or dry throats or just good for something to have. Thanks for making them available to us again.
1;These cough drops are great. My grandparents have used them most of thier life but could they help me too? Yes My throat was better quick. The taste is acquired and I have not yet. I will though because they work better than halls and ricola and all the others.
1;I use this porcini salt in many savory dishes - cooked entrees and salads. Delicious. You don't have to use a lot for it to make a big difference. Just a small sprinkle will do the job. It seems expensive for such a little jar but the impact from just a small sprinkle is worth the cost.
1;"""I found that best way to brew this is to use the drip-style coffee maker. 1 tea bag for 12 cups of coffee. I tried in a pot of hot water but coffee maker extracts the most tea out. It tasted funny at first but it's not unbearable. It's much easier to drink while it's hot or warm. At first"
1;I bought this as a gift for someone around the holidays. I wanted to find something that is as good as quality as other places but has a reasonable price. I was very happy with my purchase and the recipient was very pleased and happy to receive it. I will be purchasing more of this product in the future. VERY Very Very Very please with purchase and shipping time.
1;"""I have to say that once again I'm impressed with Spring in the Air.  The order was shipped almost at the speed of light and I got their beautiful flowers faster than I expected.  Fortunately the vases I ordered to put them in arrived at the same time.  Price is right"
1;This Company sent the most beautiful Pink long stem roses I had ever seen to my Mom for this Mother's Day! They arrived eary and in superb condition! Roses were fresh and Mom was impressed. I will definately order from them again!!!!
1;My mother screamed with delight so I guess that means they're really darn nice flowers.  They arrived perfect and the quality was simply astounding.  There's no better bang for the buck and yet these are no typical rose - they're quite special and different than the norm.  This is a winner you'll be glad you went with.
1;"""One of my cats has had a chronic constipation problem most of her life.  The Friskies Indoor Selects Classic Chicken Entree is her favorite flavor of all.  Since this has brown rice and spinach as some of the ingredients it has helped keep Stinky a little more  regular .  My vet believes all cats should get *some* wet food per day - he gave his approval on this brand over some of the others"
1;My cats are very picky but they love this food. It is very dense and provides a large amount of good quality food for my two cats. I especially like the fact that there are garden greens inside the food. It is good for their digestion.
1;"""I have the enviable job of getting two pills into Cee Cee daily. I would mix them with her wet food (brand X). There were times she would NOT eat her foodies! There went the pills and my money. But I decided to buy ONE can of this food to see if she would eat it -- wow -- she scarfed up everythiing"
1;A recent trip to Mexico introduced me to this tasty seasoning dificult to find in local markets.<br /><br />Good on all kinds of meats includin seafood. Amazing on halibut steaks and even turkey.<br /><br />Amazon.com is an amaziing resource for hard to find items.
1;My family were addicted to the South Beach protein bars and were disappointed that they were discontinued.  I found these here and bought them thinking they looked in the picture like the South Beach bars and was very happy when I received them and they were the same bars as far as I could tell.  These are sweet and a little crunchy but not too crunchy and not near as crunchy as granola bars.  They keep me from getting hungry when I cannot eat a full meal.  They do not have that gritty taste that some protein bars have.  I find that the flavor is like a cross between a cinnamon bun and a pecan roll.  Very good and glad to have found them here!
1;"""I was a fan of the original South Beach Cereal Bars as my breakfast  treat  with my morning coffee during my weight loss journey. When Kraft Foods reinvented and reintroduced them as SnackWell cereal bars I was thrilled.  Nothing starts off my healthy"
1;I've used Whip It for a long time.  It's a really good stabilizer of real whipped cream...makes it very thick and yummy.  And it does last longer in the 'fridge.  FYI:  you can buy 2 of these packets on iherb.com for less.
1;"""This product is truly amazing. I made whipped cream to frost my banana split cupcakes. It held up with cherries on top and still tasted great. Will be buying the 30 pk. Must have if you like making cakes/cupcakes"
1;"""Don Pepino pizza sauce is the best canned pizza sauce bar none!  DO NOT LET THE GIMMICKY LABEL DETER YOUR CONFIDENCE IN THIS PRODUCT!  I was turned on to this sauce by a dear friend of mine who pointed it out to me in Swiacki's Store in Philly:<br />Swiacki Meats<br />3623 Salmon Sreet<br />Philadelphia"
1;Im big on barbeque.. so i tried this pinot noir portabella marinade... the flavor exceeded my expectations. Theres a slight undertone of wine complimented with a light burst of mushroom.<br />I highly recomend it..
1;"""I have tried many brands and this is the best. Pappardelle is not too sticky and not too flimsy.  Holds up nicely with a dense sauce.  You could easily pass this off as  your own homemade . When I serve it people always want to know more about the pasta. It makes a great hostess gift"
1;"""While I understand they are a little sweet...they taste sooo good!  My coworker hated them...so it's really about personal taste on this one...you seem to either love them or hate them... though I have to say"
1;"""I got this for my 100lb laberdoodle I want to keep her healthy so I get her real stuff to enjoy. I like the fact that the bones are not bleached like most dog treats. People buying treats for their dogs need to remember they are carnivores they need the protean and calcium that the marrow gives them. Not to mention they love bones"
1;"""I used this squid ink for a recipe out of Ferran Adria's new Family Meal cookbook.  I had to buy on Amazon since apparently no one in Dallas has ever heard of or carried squid ink in their stores.  Thank goodness for online ordering!<br /><br />I used two of the four packets for the recipe (for 2 servings of squid risotto)"
1;"""this is very good it comes with a seasoning packet you can add(chicken) and it is really good. the directions are for the entire bag and makes between 3 and 4 cups.(you add 2 cups water bring to boil and then simmer 45 minuets"
1;I was extremely pleased with this product and sender. My bonsai tree came within a week of ordering it. My experience with the sender was better than great and I would definately reccomend using them in the future. Thanks
1;Not to long I receive my tree. I was surprise the tree I received is beautiful and strong. It arrived very well pack and in good health.  Lousbonsai even send me his business card and letter about taking care of your bonsai and if you have any question about the your tree.  I call him he's very helpful and  he also tell you what recommend for your tree.  I would recommend him for the next purchased in the  near future. Keep it up and very helpful.
1;I get this drink at my favorite coffee shop and was excited to see I could get some for home for when I just do not feel like going out. This is the best tasting Chai and was so glad to see it available through Amazon at such a great price. Shipping was quick and the product as fresh as at my local coffeeshop! A great buy indeed!!
1;I love this product.  My daughter in law served me some one day when I was really down because of my  mother's impending death.  The hot spicy flavor served on the deck of the house was what I needed.  It was absolutely the best chai ever!!!!
1;"""I've used this item for stunning drink presentations but have routinely been entertaining  self  at home.  The syrup's amazing and the flower is edible.  The flower stuns everyone at first but when they taste"
1;"""The glasses were raised and so were the smiles when I served champagne accented with Wild Hibiscus Flowers in Syrup. This unique product is a way to create an instant party with a touch of glamour.  I ordered several jars and I'm very glad I did. My guests have been surpirsed and delighted.This gourmet treat also makes a special"
1;"""My Australian Shepard puppy LOVES these treats. She is usually a tough one to impress but these little things I swear made her eyes roll back. Picked these up very cheap at my local grocery store and well worth it. One thing to consider with these is you have probably 100 or more mini treats inside this bag. Compared to other dog treats that maybe have a few large pieces"
1;"""Zuma my Hairless Chinese Crested pup is a very finicky eater and would rather starve then eat something he doesn't like. The only food he will eat is Cesar Gourmet Filets in sauce...... OK  now to find a dog treat he likes. My husband brought home  Cesar Grilled Chicken softies dog treats  and he LOVES them. The treats do look and smell like a dog treat and I thought there was no way Zuma would eat them.  So hundreds of dollars spent at numerous bog bakeries  and a year and a half spent shopping all all over the place"
1;I purchased this tea originally at Christmas for my mother.  She just loves it!  Just in time for Mother's Day she needed more and I could not find in our local stores.  I was excited to find it available on amazon and was very pleased with the delivery!
1;"""My fiancee brought this home from his moms and my cat went crazy! She inhaled an entire can in seconds and then begged for more. I completely grossed my fiancee out when I tasted it and let me tell you as someone who is an avid cook the Chicken Pot Pie is very good. I make chicken pot pie and reading the ingredients were like reading the ingredients in a chicken pot pie you would make or buy for yourself. The chicken did not taste processed. The first time I saw the can of food I thought it was gourmet tuna and had to read to make sure it was cat food. I can't say that I blame my kitty for enjoying this so much. We have a local health food store that carries it so it's easy to find for me but the deals online are amazing! I'll be going via Amazon from now on. My cat reacts to this the way she reacts to fresh tuna"
1;Petite Cusine is the only canned food I feed my two cats Smokie and Elvira. Its natural products are my main cuncern. They let me know when it time to feed them. They both block my way in the kitchen till I feed them.
1;"""Directly above it says this review is FROM Petite Cuisine Cat Food. In actuality it is FOR Petite Cuisine Cat Food!!!<br /><br />I used to purchase this cat food at Winn-Dixie stores. About six months ago they stopped carrying it. Amazon was the only place I could find besides the manufacturer that would sell me this at retail. Since the manufacturer wanted an exorbitant amount for purchase at retail Amazon was the only retailer left. Fortunately for me the Amazon program of monthly purchases worked out perfectly. It enables me to buy the food at a price that is acceptable and keeps my cats happy at the same time.<br /><br />As far as the food itself is concerned all I can say is that the cats love it"
1;`I was very pleased to see this product online.  I always bought Baby Girls canned food at Food Lion and now they no longer carry it at the local store.  Every cat and kitten who has had the pleasure of trying it loves it.  NOT gummy or looks like mystery meat.  Great product.
1;"""The ingredients in this seems to be better then  Fancy Feast  which is mostly fat. I have one finicky cat and one who will eat anything. Both love it. It is a good every other day [half way healthy] treat for them."""
1;"""Our cat is 6-years-old and has eaten (voraciously) the same brand of food in both the chow and the canned variety for all of his life.  He's not at all a picky eater (even given to nabbing a potato chip if he can).<br /> Nonetheless"
1;"""We used to make our own cat food & this is a excellent substitute!  It looks & smells wonderful!  Get out your fork for the Chinese chicken or your spoon for the Chicken Pot Pie & dig in!<br />We have six cats & all six of them loved this!<br />The Chinese chicken is shredded white meat & a little bit of carrots in broth.  Mostly shredded meat.  You can smell the sesame!<br />The Chicken Pot Pie has cubes of white meat in a broth with carrots.  This isn't as filling for the kitties.  They did enjoy the broth a lot!  Later they went back for the meat.  The Chicken Pot Pie would be perfect if for your kitty if you are trying to get kitty to get more liquids in their diet.  One of our males"
1;"""First thing I did was check the ingredients.  No wheat and no corn.  That's good.  The main ingredients are good animal protein sources.<br /><br />There were two flavors in the pack I received:  Chicken pot pie and sesame chicken.  The sesame chicken smelled great!  I literally could have been fooled into eating it myself.  It had a high moisture content and the chicken was shredded.  My cat at all the liquid and then went to work on the meat stuff.  Shredded isn't his favorite texture at all"
1;"""Petite Cuisine Gourmet Cat Food was a real hit with my impossible cat.  My cat refuses almost all canned cat food so I was completely shocked when she showed an interest in this food.  The food looked like human food.  My only complaint is that I had to drain the juices from the can before I could serve it to my cat.  My cat actually ate a good portion of it"
1;"""We have two cats in our family. One will try just about anything the other one typically will only eat dry food.  My dry catfood eater could not get to the dish fast enough and he ate every last bite of it which is unusual for him.  My try anything cat also loved the food as well. It was a great treat for them.<br />Upon opening the can of food it smells like fresh fish"
1;"""This was a serious surprise to us... our cats have always refused wet cat food except for people quality tuna in the can. Soon as we opened these for them ( was a varity pack ) they scarfed one down and everyday wanted more .. it really looks"
1;"""This is some of the healthiest cat food on the market. It is all natural and doesn't contain food byproducts. What comes out of the can looks like real food (just below human quality) not a mash-up of mysterious goop. The fish in these cans has texture"
1;"""My cat gobbled this food right up!  Each small serving can is perfect to feed one cat without the worry of overfeeding.  My cat is elderly and very picky about her food.  She the entire can of food in both flavors.  I liked the fact that the food doesn't smell too bad like many cat foods do"
1;"""The kitties seemed to know the package from Amazon was for them and meowed loudly while I opened it up. Petite Cuisine Variety pack was here!<br /><br />This product comes in a 3 oz can which is just the right size to split between the two cats. (Of course"
1;"""I had been told that finally the day would come when my own package from amazon would come and today it finally came. What was in the box was basically the winnings from some cat lottery.  A case of seafood dinners-Yellowfin"
1;My Kitty is PICKY!!!  She loves this gourmet food so much! After my kitty fell in love with it (found some on clearance locally) I could not find it in the stores.  I am so happy that I found it on Amazon and having it delivered on a schedule makes it easy! God only knows what would happen if I ever ran out!!!
1;My cat is diabetic and was on insulin twice a day. I started researching and found that this was the highest protien lowest carb wet cat food I could get. My 15 year old cat now eats Petite Cuisine morning and night and has Purina DM Diebetic management dry food available 24 hours a day and he is no longer on any insulin. He loves the Petite Cuisine it is ALL Natural and looks and smells like people food. I'm afraid to taste it but the ingredients are all good enough for humans so they are great for my cat!! I strongly recomend this food.
1;This is the best cat food around.  It is large pieces of meat and just the right amount of juice.  Smells great to people and cats.  I was buying it in the grocery store but it is no longer carried.  Will continue buying online!
1;"""All 6 of my cats delve into their dishes when I fill it with one of the selections from this multipak.  The handsdown favorite is the Tuna and Shrimp - I can barely get the food in the dish before it is inhaled.  They walk around licking their lips and looking for seconds! One cat"
1;"""This is great food and all my cats love it.  It's the perfect size for an adult cat to eat.  It looks like 'real' food and doesn't have all the junk normal cat food has.  I have also found that it does not make my cats sick when they eat it.  It's pricey"
1;This is a great tuna cat food. My male is so picky about his tuna. He will only eat yellow or white tuna. I am so glad the Amazon picked this cat food up to sell. If you go to Petitecuisine.com they have even more people talking about this food. Their web site allows you to order a 4 pack trial for 5.00 and it got here in no time. Amazon has a great deal on this food till Sept. 30th it is worth every penny. I will be ordering more.

1;"""We have two cats and they are picky with their  crunchy  food and seem to like most  soft  cat food. They both liked this soft food and didn't have any issues with it. Sometimes they've not liked some of the soft food and cat vomit is not fun to clean up.<br /><br />The cats heard me opening up the food and would bolt into the kitchen and lick their bowls clean. That is a five claw rating."""
1;"""I was so excited to treat my 3 kitties to  People Food for Cats  ~ Petite Cuisine!!  They eat dry food daily and then once in awhile they get the moist food as a special treat.<br /><br />In opening the can"
1;"""I cannot really comment my own opinions on this product since for obvious reasons I will not be sampling it but I will trust the vendor that it is every bit as good for my cat as they say.  How would I know differently anyway?  All I can tell you is my cat's reaction.  This consisted of the following:<br /><br /> Meowwwww! Errowwww!  (as I am dishing it out)  After placing it on the floor there was copious munching and slurping until the bowl was empty followed by licking of chops to devour anyy stray morsel that may have stuck to a whisker and then a forlorn look that indicated the preceding events should be repeated.  I'll take that as two paws up or whatever the feline equivalent is to the Siskel & Ebert sign of approval.<br /><br />None of this is any great surprise.  The noted finickiness of cats usually applies to dry food.  Place a bowl of any random dead animal parts in front of them and they are far more decisive.  Still"
1;"""I have a Bengal cat and was looking for a good quality food that had the taurine she needs. She was very thin when I got her (a rescue) and was a bit picky. I tried a large number of foods including some quite expensive ones"
1;My cats (all 5 of them) go insane when I bring out the Petite Cuisine.  The red snapper is one of their favorites - have tried several of the PC entrees - only one they didn't go crazy over - the Chicken pot pie - way too much liquid (half the tiny can!)
1;discovered petit cuisine at winn-dixie-bought 4 can variety pack for my cat tut-he preferred tuna/sole and especially red snapper entree-could not buy single cans in store-found them at amazon.com-no more wasting food on tut-i know he will eat his red snapper.
1;discovered petit cuisine at winn-dixie-bought 4 can variety pack for my cat Tut-he preferred tuna/sole and red snapper entrees-unable to buy single cans in store-found them at amazon.com-now know i'm feeding Tut food he totally enjoys.
1;"""This is an edit so I was unable to change my star rating.  At first I was happy with this canned cat food until the trouble began.  It has caused severe diarrhea in both of my cats who were eating it.  Now I'm in the process of trying to get things back on track.  As anyone who has been in this situation knows"
1;"""All four of my cats loved this canned cat food!  The food in each can really looked and smelled as if a human being could eat the food.<br /><br />The seasame chicken entree and chicken pot pie entree were both very popular with my cats.  Neither flavor smelled bad.  The chicken pot pie entree was kind of runny"
1;What a great way to try all the sugar Free Torani sytups.<br />Great brand with great flavor.. and this is good price because<br />my grocery store has these big bottle for about 8 bucks.<br /><br />I only wish Amazon offered more sugar free flavors.
1;Wonderful flavors at a good price all from the convenience of home. I had shopped for these in many stores and was deighted to finally find them on Amazon. I add them to my Almond milk and make a delightful low calorie snack.
1;We use in our homemade Frappes. I originally bought the variety pack to see which ones I would like best. I thought I would like the chocolate best but I liked the Irish Cream and my husband likes the vanilla. The best part is that it is made with Splenda instead of aspartame.
1;These can transform a plain coffee to something wonderful with NO Calories and it is made with SPLENDA.<br /><br />I am on a protein shake diet and these create new flavors and makes the process not so boring!
1;I love flavored coffee!  Having 6 flavors is awesome.  I am not crazy about the vanilla but that is because I like chocolate more.  These flavors are also good in yogurt.  I always have trouble choosing a flavor coffee in the a.m. so I have a second cup just to have more flavors.  Love these!
1;We save lots of money using these instead of flavored coffee creamer from the grocery store. I love the raspberry for Italian sodas and in whipped cream for a great fresh berry topping. Chocolate is my least favorite because I'm a chocolate snob but I have made some decadent raspberry mochas with it. Great value- a small bottle is over $5 at my grocery store!
1;"""Found out about this stuff on TheWorldAccordingToEggface and everything she uses this stuff in really tastes better.  I use it in protein shakes and protein sugar free low fat homemade ice cream.  It just adds a touch of flavor with no calories"
1;"""Just received the sugar free assortment.  Very happy with it... they all taste good.  Just have a request and observation. Request...PLEASE carry these with the glass bottles instead of the cheap plastic bottles!  I received Torani in plastic bottles (which I had never seen before) and was not pleased about that.  Not too thrilled about having syrups sit a long time in plastic bottles...yuck! Looks kinda tacky sitting on the bar too...the glass is a nice classic presentation.  Also"
1;"""I always thought alot of salt was tasty and good for you. Maybe that's why I need to take pills for high blood pressure. Bout time someone steps up to the plate to help provide products that improve your health if you choose.<br />The strangest thing that happened is that I have tried a number of no salt items"
1;"""I originally gave this item one star because the box was busted open and I only received about half of the box worth of product. I tried the return link but it indicated that the product was non-returnable and that I should use the  help  link instead. I went to the help section and reported that the shipment was damaged and in my opinion should be replaced. After I submitted that"
1;We have had cats for many years and this litter is the best by far of all the brands we tried.<br />I have found one trick to keeping this fom sticking to litterbox bags is to keep the plastic bag smooth on the bottom of box and litter clumps perfect every time.
1;This is probably the best flavored coffee I and my co-workers have ever had.  We all share in the purchase of the K cups but this is everyones favorite.  Very distinctive Chocolate and Raspberry flavours and the smell is delicious just awesome.
1;I am not a fan of oatmeal due to texture issues and have never been able to finish a bowl of oatmeal until I tried this dark chocolate oatmeal.  The chocolate used in this product tastes wonderful.  I will continue to buy this.
1;"""I was introduced to this dog food over tens years ago. One of the local pet stores recommended it for our golden retriever because of the skin problems that he was experiencing. His skin and coat were back to normal once he had been on this dog food for two weeks. I've been feeding it to all my dogs ever since. I have four dogs now and so the price  on Amazon is really appreciated...Along with the quick delivery. As an aside: My dogs love the taste so much that I have used the kibble as their behavioral treat as well (e.g."
1;I rescued a Pitbull from deplorable conditions when she was 5 months old and she was a mess!  She had allergies and mange and her immume system was very compromised.  I put her on this food and it cleared her skin up in less than a month!  I've researched a lot of food online and at the Pet stores and this I believe is the best!  It is a tad pricey but if you love your dog like I do then it's worth it.  I hope Amazon will continue to carry this for a very long time.
1;I own two akitas and have been trying to find a high quality food that they both like and do well on.  Both of them can't wait to eat this food and their stools are perfect.  I would highly recommend this for your dog!
1;I have been using this food for my 3 dogs for over a year. It is a product that they dont an allergic reaction to and is high in proteins and fish oils. The price has been increasing recently and through Cajunmarket.info I was able to save some money over what the local stores charged.
1;My dog is 3 and he has been chewing and licking his paws for as long as I can remember.  Probably half his day was spent chewing and licking.  He has had many steroid shots and has been taking claritin twice a day for several months.  Nothing has worked....I decided to try this dog food before taking him to a specialist and it has been amazing.  He has been eating the salmon and potatoes formula exclusively for about a week and a half and now he is hardly ever licking his paws!!!  Today I even skipped his claritin and he has not licked his paws all day.  No more grains for my dog!
1;"""6 of 6 cans received damaged - Product Outstanding.<br />Quality of product for the price paid is a good bang for the buck.<br />Unable to use one of the cans because of extreem damage.<br />Product was well packaged with no sign of damage on box.<br />I expect product was shipped dammaged"
1;"""Tully's Coffee  Kona Blend (Extra Bold)  K-Cups produce a very good cup of coffee in my <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA >Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a>. Even on the  Large Cup  setting"
1;Tully k-cups are delicious. I have tried several different flavors and have been pleased with their full bodied taste. One of my favorites is the Kona blend. It offers a satisfying cup of coffee all the time - never disappoints. I will not go back to the old coffee pots ever.
1;Not sure how you review coffee. Everyone has their own favorites. I happen to love Kona and because of the draught it is getting harder to find. this came to me very fast and in good condition. So I have no complaints.
1;Really delicious and sooooo chocolately! Just like the real thing. I adjust the ratios of milk and mix to my liking and ignore the instructions on the back. You can also get alot more than 1 drink per package if you drink a normal sized glass (I get 3 shakes per pack at about 16 oz. per shake). Really good! A must try at least once in your life!
1;every trip to NYC includes a stop at serendipity--- love the frozen hot chocolate and this is the same thing from home!!!  love surprising my son  by making it once in  awhile... brings back memories and just taastes soooo good!  Bought several to keep on hand.
1;I purchased this item for Valentines Day and I can't wait to give them to the recipients. Each package ( there are 3) has 3 servings. I am sure they will be enjoyed very much. Maybe one of the 3 will share some with me.
1;i used to go to serendipity 3 when i lived in nyc and always had a frozen hot chocolate there --- i have bought the mix before and it always reminds me of the many visits to their restaurant/store-  all the friends that i have served it to have complimented me on the unusual dessert -- highy recommend it
1;"""I looked everywhere for this when I heard this flavor was coming out.  I get the peppermint mochas at Starbucks during the holidays so I was very excited when I got the Tassimo email that this flavor was available for the holidays.  Of course when I went to buy it"
1;I bought a Tassimo coffee machine for my daughter and her college roommates. They absolutely love the machine and the Peppermint Mocha disappeared quickly last winter. It appears that this flavor is seasonal. My daughter wanted more as soon as I found it available. The delivery was quick. My daughter said this Tassimo selection is even better than Starbucks and is far less expensive. Well worth it.
1;I have a Tassimo coffee maker for 2 years now.  This is the best coffee I've tasted in those two years.  My Granddaughter says this flavor coffee is better than McDonald's!!!!!  Wish it were available year around.
1;"""We have been buying this particular Lavazza coffee for a number of years now and it is still our favorite Whole Bean coffee. We tried other Lavazza Whole Bean flavors but ended up staying with this one also because it is Rainforest Alliance certified"
1;I have been making my morning espresso with Lavazza Tierra beans for years.  The full body taste and smooth flavor gets the morning off to a great start.  I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who enjoys a high quality espresso.
1;"""The previous reviewers have said it all. These really are the best and healthiest dried cranberries I've found - organic and apple-sweetened. My biggest problem is keeping them on my shelf. I'm using them in place of raisins in almost everything I make - oatmeal"
1;So happy to be able to find organic dried cranberries NOT sweetened with sugar.  The organic apple juice Eden uses instead of sugar gives the dried fruit a sweetness I did not expect.  I will certainly buy this product again and recommend it to others.
1;Friskies Natural Sensations Tuna Treats are a favorite of my cats.  It was really nice to find them on Amazon and available as a Subscribe and save item.  Now I can get this somewhat expensive treat at a better price than I could get at a pet store or at the grocery store.
1;"""I purchased this Hot Sauce while on a trip to South Dakota.<br />Since finishing it I have not been able to find it in any store on the East Coat.<br />I was so excited to find this listed on Amazon.<br /><br />I like HOT things. Although I won't do Ghost Chili Hot.<br />I really enjoy it because it is hot enough for me but not too much.<br />It has great taste as well. Not too vinegary as some other hot sauces are.<br /><br />For the size of the bottle"
1;"""If you haven't been introduced to Saint Andre soft cheese you are not living.  It's like Brie mixed with butter.  The flavor is milder then Brie and the texture is very much like fresh butter.  It's firmer inside then Brie"
1;This is delicious coffee which compares favorably with much higher priced coffee.  It's a well-kept secret!  Low acidity and smooth taste are hallmarks of this brew.<br /><br />I especially liked the fact that each bag is resealable to keep the coffee at maximum freshness.  I will definitely buy again and again.
1;I ordered this in mid October 2009.  The bags were dated February 2009.<br /><br />A friend of mine had visited this region of Guatemala and had brought me back some of the coffee beans from his trip.  I was astounded by how the coffee lacked the bitterness you can find in most other coffees.  There also seems to be some hints of cherries or some other nutty/fruity flavor.  I have used multiple grind settings when using this (drip coffee maker) and found that it tolerates a very fine grind well.  The looser grinds and small amounts of the coffee can leave this weak though.<br /><br />Highly recommend this coffee.
1;"""These biscuits are excellent and have become a staple in my cupboard. I will have to agree that the packaging and shipping from Amazon leaves a lot to be desired. I have received two shipments on this product. The first shipment was great with little to no crumbling or crushing....as good or better than what I found in my local grocer. The second shipment arrived in very poor condition. The box looked like it had been dropped kicked a couple of times. There is no effort to cushion or protect these biscuits from shipping damage. The six biscuit packages are simply put in the shipping box"
1;0 STARS for the packaging.  It was borderline acceptable.  Not completely taped shut and was possible to reach inside package without disturbing existing tape.  In this day and age that is poor form.  In addition poorly padded inside.  Biscuits broken but packages intact.  Enjoy them so much I ate them anyway.  Glad that they are available widely in the US now.  Will continue to buy biscuits but find different shipper.
1;"""This was the best deal on buying imported digestives I have ever found.  Seven large packages of the one and only true digestive fromn MvVitie.  The name  Digestive  might put you off but the taste with a cup of tea is out of this world and the price unequaled."""
1;We were looking for a good-quality tea biscuit and searched Amazon for some with favorable reviews. These seemed to fit the bill so we ordered some. They are simply a perfect biscuit. They are tender and flaky and absorb tea without falling apart (as long as you dunk them quickly). I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a delicious biscuit.
1;"""I've very glad that Amazon and other companies are making more English foods available in the U.S. McVities make a high quality product and slightly a bit different than many of the similar products sold here. The years the I spent in England McVities was my favorite brand of biscuits (cookies).<br />Through some Amazon.com deals you can get a good price"
1;This is one of my favorite biscuits. The batch I received had best before date after only 4 months. Packaging and shipping from amazon was good. I received it within a week after I ordered. I will definitely buy again. Good Job amazon shipping department.
1;"""I can't start my day without these cookies with my morning tea/coffee! Taste great like graham crackers but not as super sweet and not heavy on the tummy..no matter how many i eat : ) Bit expensive though in comparison to other cookies but considering they are imported from UK"
1;This is the original wing sauce from Buffalo and it does not get any better.  The best part is that you can avoid deep frying(even though instructions say to do this)...just put 2 lbs. of wings on a cookie sheet sprayed with PAM-bake for 20 minutes at 425-turn over and finish for 15 more.  Toss with 1/2 cup sauce and you're done!!!!
1;DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM FROM THIS VENDOR AS YOU CAN GET IT CHEAPER AT YOUR SUPERMARKET.  THESE GUYS JACKED THE PRICE UP SO MUCH THAT IT'S NO LONGER WORTH BUYING FROM AMAZON.  IT USED TO BE UNDER 29.00 (WITH AMAZON PRIME) BUT NOW THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE.<br /><br />Wait until Amazon has a respectable vendor selling this item...
1;I was thrilled to find this tea. It has a wonderful robust flavor. Do yourself a favor and go to your local Indian grocer. I bought a box of this brand loose tea for $18.00 ... for a 3Lb 15oz box!  I would say that is a much better buy than here!
1;I have bought this product many times.  Always consistent.  I use it to make ice tea and it works great.  Less expensive then the name brand tea bags and better quality.  It is a strong tea so a box lasts.
1;I had never used parchment paper until I bought this and the version that tears off from a roll.  I will never bake again without it!  My cookies are beautiful!  Professional results in my little kitchen.  I can't wait for the xmas creations later this year!  Highly recommend.
1;These individual unbleached parchment sheets save me so much time from having to cut from a roll!  I make whoopie pies from scratch and sell them and this is an immense time saver for me.  Would highly recommend!
1;if you don't like cleaning cookie sheets and you don't like the idea of chemicals leaking in your food I highly recommend this product. my wife and I bake with these all the time and I've been very happy with the results. you can also use the sheets for rolling out pie crust or other pastries.
1;"""I found these snacks on a jetblue flight and since then they have been my primary snacking chip. They are have pretty much healthy snacks for you because their is nothing bad in them. It is quite amazing and they are even gluten free for people that need good snacks like that.<br /><br />The most important part is they are delicious. I can't quite describe them"
1;I had these chips once on a flight and have been hooked on them ever since. Unfortunately they were not sold at any store near me so i found them on here and jumped on them. They speedy shipping surprised me but im pretty sure that was the companies way of assuring freshness. I bought two boxes to last me the rest of my school semester and so far they taste great. Couldnt be happier :-) 5star service for sure
1;"""These chips are so addicting and so yummy.  They are crunchy and slightly salty without being overwhelming.  My two boys ages 3 and 6 love these as well.  So much better for them than daddy's potato chips.  They are a slightly less guilty treat for myself and my boys.  Another awesome thing about these is they don't contain any artificial colors"
1;We've been buying the decaf Celestial green tea with mandrin orange for a few years now and just love it.  My wife and I enjoy a cup nearly every day and it seems to do its part in winding us down from the day.  I've heard/read green tea is healthy and that may well be but I can say this one is very pleasing and comforting at a minimum.<br /><br />Regis
1;I had been searching for the coffee syrup pumps for a few months so was happy to se them on Amazon.  I bought the two pack and they fit very well on my DaVinci flavoring bottles.  The prices was extremely reasonable and I was suprised when they showed up on my doorstep 5 days before expected!  I will certainly be buying another set soon!
1;"""I tried Greenies on my dog about 8 years ago and he won't eat them.  So I tried dental rawhide chews which he chewed just fine.  My dog is now 13 years old and he started to swallow the dental rawhide whole and would choke on them.  I'm not sure because of his age that he tries to swallow them whole"
1;My dog loves greenies - she waits for them everyday!  We give her one regular sized one per day and the teenies as treats for going outside etc.  I have heard that these do not digest easily if your dog is not a chewer.  My dog is a chewer so it works out great.  She is addicted!
1;My dog looks forward to a Greenie dessert everyday.  You will NOT find this deal at the local pet stores.  I love the fact that I get a good deal at Amazon.  I save time and gas.  My dog thanks us both.
1;"""I have two Airedales.  They aren't fussy eaters - or snackers - but each gets a Greenie at bedtime.  We let them out in the yard for a bit before they go to bed and all I have to do is say  Time for your Greenies!  to make them race for the house and dance around until they get that bedtime snack.  It's their special treat and I love the fact that they actually have to chew them moderately slowly instead of just inhaling them!  The only drawback is that they're expensive."""
1;"""<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KBFKIQ >Greenies Dental Chews - 27 ounce Box - Petite - 45 count</a> Very good product delivered promptly at a fair price. Will order more from this site."""
1;"""I buy the teenie greenies and break them in half for our dogs.  They go nuts over them no matter what the size.  Having them in a  lite  version is even better because the vet did tell me they are high in calories.  Don't know what they put in these things to make them so appealing"
1;Our beautiful Belle loves her daily toothbrush treat. Amazon provides an awesome price and delivers them to our doorstep. That makes it even handier. The Greenies are a proven winner for a more natural breath freshening dog treat. Too bad Greenies doesn't get more 'green' with their packaging and lose the outer box that they use. The sealed inside bag would be plenty good enough. It keeps the treats fresh and takes up less space. The first thing we do is toss the box out--- what a waste!
1;"""These tinnie greenies make the perfect  out the door  bribe for my Cavlier King Charles Babies. I think they almost look forward to me going to work now.  Barkley is 21 lbs & Gypsy is 18 so while they are a bit larger than the recommended size for the product it really works out perfectly helping keep the pounds off.<br /><br />Having shopped around"
1;I have a two year old chihuahua mix.My vet shared with me that I would have to be vigilant about the health of my Pups teeth.Greenies help keep my dogs teeth clean and his breath fresh. And best of all my Pups loves them above all other treats.
1;They're a great product and automated delivery at great prices can't be beat!  My dogs go crazy when it comes to greenie time at night.  No matter how many nights we do the same thing they are always over the top for greenies
1;I have 2 small dogs and one really small dog.  They all get one Greenie a day.  They LOVE their greenies!1 I love that the Greenies help to keep their mouths fresh and clean. They are adorable and are shaped like a mini toothbrush!!!
1;Did some research because my dogs have bad breath and dirty teeth. I have tried brushing their teeth with doggie toothpaste and have bought all kinds of chewy treats but nothing worked. So I bought these and gave each dog a treat every morning.  Not only does their breath smell better but their teeth look cleaner as well. I quickly bought a second box. The dogs seem to enjoy the taste and they are made so that the dog can't just gulp them down.  They have to chew them.  I would highly recommend these treats.
1;I have subsribed to the monthly shipment of Greenies 27 oz canister teenie 96 count product and each month the price increases.  If i sign up today the price drops to $19.94.  Why the increase?  Seems like they lock you in for a scheduled order and then take advantage of you hoping that you won't notice the price increases.<br /><br />The product is great and my dogs love them but the business practice of the price hikes is terrible.
1;My two dogs love these.  Now as to do they work.  I honestly do not know.  Both of my dogs are right now at what my vet calls stage two on dental health.  Stage four is the worst on his scale.  I am going to monitor and see IF just maybe they will either still be a stage two in a year or maybe better.  If they maintain at stage two I would love it.  Teeth cleaning on dogs is very expensive so if this product works it will save me big bucks.  Here's hoping!  I will come back and update this after their next check up which should be around August of 2013.
1;"""I am always concerned with my dogs oral health. I have found that my dogs love the Greenies and they do a good job of helping to keep the tarter build up off their teeth! I have one dog that is very particular about his treats and what he will chew on but he loves the Greenies"
1;"""My dog loves these snacks.  I have a smaller rat terrier mix dog she loves these even more than Cherrio's.  They come in a canister which is flimsy but I threw it away as they are also in a resealable bag. They should last a fairly long time as I don't give them to her daily"
1;"""I have been buying 96-count containers of teeny greenies from Amazon for a couple of years.  They are always fresh and arrive promptly. My Yorkies look forward to one before bedtime each evening.  I don't know if they really help plaque.  They do freshen breath and have some nutrition.  Thanks to Amazon prices"
1;"""These are given to my 2 rescue dogs at the end of the day.  They know when it is time to go out for the last time at night and sit and wait for their Greenie.  All we have to say is  do you want to brush your teeth  and they go nuts.  They love them and their teeth are in great shape..."""
1;"""My German Shepherd is a complete Greenie addict.  She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth"
1;"""I give these to my dog to help with her minor tartar problems. She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat"
1;"""First some history:<br />Our dog can't chew rawhide bones.  She has a habit of breaking off pieces & swallowing them whole.  We have had problems with blockages & constipation as a result -- everytime she has received a rawhide.<br /><br />We have a 13 yr old Beagle which was introduced to Greenies about 2 yrs ago.  We were given a couple of the Large ones from a friend to try.  Through carelessness on our part"
1;"""We have been buying Greenies for Pepper for about 4 years.  He has a very sensitive stomach and can only have boiled chicken and canned and dry prescription diet ID<br />I brush his teeth every night and afterwards he gets a  greenie   he loves them and I love that they don't upset his stomach.<br />Our Vet said they should be ok for Pepper.  And they are.  Paying about 40.00 elsewhere"
1;These treats for small dogs are #1 on my dog's list of morning must haves.<br />She has been pestering me to give her a morning teenie chewy every day for many<br />months. She does not seem to tire of these unlike many treats she has tried.<br />I have heard that the official word is that these do not really promote good breath.<br />Maybe they just limit the amount of bad breath. Whatever. This box is a three<br />month supply so is a reasonably economical way to give my dog something she really likes.
1;Greenies are the special treat we give our golden retriever and great pyrenee/golden retriever mix.  Greenies are hard enough that our dogs have to chew slowly but not so hard that I feel uncomfortable giving it to them.
1;"""I have a 6 pound toy poodle and she would be very depressed without her daily ration of greenies.  She knows that after supper she receives her greenie and she loves them.  It is the one thing that I can depend on her eating.  Since we do feed a lot of soft food"
1;"""These things are awesome.  These Greenies really clean your dog's teeth very well.  When I first opened the container I was a bit skeptical because they smelled pretty bad but after a week of using these.  My dogs breath was great"
1;This is the best price for Greenies.  Greenies do a great job helping to keep my dog's teeth in their best shape.  So glad I discovered this product on Amazon as they are almost too expensive to buy anywhere else.
1;Shipped very fast.  Great product for your dog's teeth.  I have been giving my poodle greenies ofr years now and my vet said that her teeth are just as white and healthy as a 2 year old dogs.  She is 10 years old.
1;"""Our dogs adore these and they are usually fairly pricey for the amount you get. However Amazon always has one great deal or another for buying these and significantly cheaper than in store prices.<br /><br />We usually buy the 130 or 96 pack of 'Teenies' for our two chihuahua mix dogs (depending whichever has the better sale price at the time.<br /><br />The teenie size is great for our smaller dog (6lb) as he can fully chew on it and savor it. However it is not quite enough for our other chihuahua mix (13lb) she tends to gulp it down like any other dog treat without getting as much benefit from the dental cleaning that Greenies are supposed to help with. Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs. However I would not use Greenies solely to keep a dogs breath in check"
1;I give these little dental toothbrush treats to my three Yorkies and they scatter to all corners to protect and eat their treats. Small dogs often have dental problems and I use these to help their teeth!  They are the perfect size for my dogs.
1;I have a bichon beagle hybrid mix (called a glechon).  He just loves greenies. We just had him into his vet for his checkup and the vet told us that his teeth were beautiful. He wanted to know what we did to keep them that way. The only thing we do is to give him greenies. I've had two other people comment on his teeth in the past month. I highly recommend these treats for your dog if you want him to have good teeth and breath. We've never had trouble with him being able to digest them. They are a little costly but I feel they're well worth the extra cost.
1;"""It's reassuring that the treats I give my precious Yorkie are of the best quality and of course I appreciate the cost effectiveness of dealing with a reputable company.  Amazon has provided swift service and a product that would cost much more from a local pet shop.  Greenies are good for my dog's dental health and are not dangerous as are rawhides or toys with squeeking mechanisms which can choke a dog.  Just the sight of the Greenie box"
1;"""I have an 11 year old Jack Russle who's teeth have worn down over the years. Greenies are great for him as they are not hard for him to chew and he LOVES them. Every evening all I have to say is  Want your Greenie ? And he comes running. It's the only dog treat he eats now."""
1;"""My corgi loves these greenies!  I like it how the greenies come in a zippable bag inside the cardboard box!  I have the choice of throwing out the bag and using the box or vice versa!<br /><br />I chose the free shipping method.  It took awhile to ship"
1;my yorkies love these things. I have a 3 pounder and an 11 pounder and they think getting these are the bees knees! i tried the other sizes but i think since these just fit right in their mouth they love it. The product has a really over bearing smell but once you get over that (it is a dog treat) its amazing
1;My dog loooves these treats. He's a 50 lb Rhodesian Ridgeback mutt and devours these! I'm not sure about the dental impact yet as he's only had them for 2 weeks or so. But this combined with toothpaste would be more effective.
1;I like to buy Greenies for my dog but they are very expensive even in multi-packs. If you purchase at online pet stores they are somewhat less expensive but not like the boxes offered on Amazon.  Dogs need clean teeth and healthy gums and Greenies will take care of both.  Easily digestible for my 13 year old Shi-Tzu.
1;My son brought these home one day for our 12 year old Cocker Spaniel. She became 'hooked' on them rather quickly and starts howling for them around 7:00pm daily. Amazon pricing is significantly less than the local stores and Prime delivery is incredibly convenient.
1;" ""I love them <br /><br />  - Winston the dog<br /><br /> These are delicious <br /><br />  - Suzi the dog<br /><br /> feh....not a reasonable substitute for tunafish <br /><br />  - Peke the cat"""
1;My chihuahua and pomeranian get so excited when I bring out the teenie dental chews after their meal--I hope these are always in stock as I buy them frequently. It does seems to help reduce the tartar on their teeth and it's exceptionally high in protein unlike other treats.
1;This is the third  ontainer we have purchased and as a once a day treat the dogs love them. All have learned to sit and beg after each morning outing.  Try them for your dog!  Good value for your money as I use the 96 pack.
1;One greenie a day after dinner helps our dog's teeth stay cleaner.  Also we brush daily with the salmon oil infused grain alcohol gel product.  That works so much better than the enzymatic toothpastes.
1;"""Got these large Greenies originally when we noticed our 60+lb Boxer mix puppies' teeth were getting a little dirty and brushing didn't too much.  We give them each one Greenie in the morning when we leave for work"
1;"""I have used them for years.  My dog can't wait to get one each morning. She does a  Greenie Dance .  She jumps around and wiil do about anything to get the Greenie.  This was the first time I ordered them on amazon and I'm glad I did.  I got the lowest price ever and they were delivered the fastest."""
1;While they are expensive Greenies do the trick for a dogs dental health. We tried a couple other brands and went back to these. The price on Amazon cant be beat. Dog is happy as well and gets excited whenever anyone says Greenie! His breath is so much better after just a day or two of use.
1;"""we brush our dogs teeth in the morning and feed once a day at evening time so we give him a Greenie after he eats to clean up his teeth and breath because we give him Sardine oil with his meal and this works great  no fish breath .  He loves the Greenies."""
1;"""My little dog loves Greenies chews! We were first introduced to this dental treat at our vet's office and seeing how much Toby loved them I decided to start buying them for him. Imagine how surprised I was finding out the price at the pet store! When I saw this fabulous deal on Amazon for 96 Greenies I was thrilled. This will be Toby's favorite present under the tree for certain. As always"
1;"""I have no idea what is in these but my wire hair terrier goes wild when the box comes out.  My daughter started me on these and he just loves them.  Had to get the small chew so he does not get fat on them as they are loaded with calories.  Checked with my vet and they had no problem with them"
1;This is a great deal. So much cheaper than the pet store. My dog loves these and it helps her breath smell better. It used to be terrible but she has gotten better after eating these. I just wish they lasted longer for her as she can chew one up in about 2 minutes.
1;Greenies are great. I have 3 dogs who really love and 2 of them<br />the 2 yr old and the 4 yr old have beautiful clean teeth. I only<br />wish I had known about them when the 12 yr old was young.  They really<br />love them and its improves their breath
1;My dogs love these treats. I have 3 small dogs and they can't wait to get their morning dental treat. The younger dogs teeth are pretty white and I hope to keep them this way but my older dogs teeth have some tartar on them. I noticed the tartar has gone down quite a bit after a month of feeding him these treats. Hope his teeth keep getting better.
1;I haven't been using them long enough to see if they are keeping his teeth clean. I am optimistic though. Once he has finished all 96 I should be able to tell.<br />He gets one a day and really loves them.
1;After doing an extensive price comparison we ended up purchasing a double pack from Amazon. So pleased with the Greenies product! Took one of our dogs for his annual exam yesterday and the doctor mentioned TWICE how good our boy's teeth look! YAY!
1;very cheap compared to buying in the stores. great price for this product. product was fresh not stale. i don't know why they insist on making you put 20 words down for just saying the product is low cost and good.
1;"""We give Greenies ( Teenie  size) to our 12-year old miniature poodle. Her doctor has always commented on how clean and healthy her teeth and gums are and has never had to put her under for a cleaning. Her breath is nicer"
1;"""You cant go wrong with greenies! My dogs love them and go nuts on them. Only downside to this is that its so soft it gets chewed up quickly so i dont quite see how this will improve the dogs teeth and gums.<br /><br />Amazon has the best prices by far and with no tax + amazon prime"
1;"""Greenies are a healthy treat for dogs and they love them!  I first bought them while working at a hardware/feed store to give them a try. We were so pleased to find them on Amazon at nearly half the price.  Every dog owner should try them"
1;"""My 60 lb Ridgeback-mix is just crazy about these.  By about 10:30p he starts anticipating getting his nighttime treat and he won't leave me alone until I give him his Greenie.  I had a Sheltie-mix who didn't care for Greenies but this guy loves 'em.  The vet says they're good for him and we've never experienced any problems digestively speaking so if your four pawed friend is a Greenie fan"
1;I purchased these for my dogs for thier teeth cleaning capabilities. My dogs love them and the price on Amazon was much better than in the stores. They do help with cleaning the tarter off of my dogs teeth
1;Good value for a lot of treats! my dog absolutely loves these and it's awesome that they sell them on amazon for half the price of what they would sell it for at a pet store! Will continue buying from here as long as they're available :)
1;"""No doggie breath for our dog.  People are always commenting that she doesn't have bad breath and her teeth look so clean.  A friend of ours who runs a veterinary and rescue clinic recommended them to us when our dog was very little"
1;"""Being the  mom  of three mini wirehair doxies I spend a lot of money on a number of things.  Imagine my surprise to find such a bargain of Greenies on Amazon.  I really must make a habit of first checking any purchases to see if available on Amazon.  Hang tough on the CA sales tax issue"
1;my pug misty is 7 years old i have given her greenies seince she was 4 months old. i give her 1 a day as a treat. i give them on the second time she goes out side in the morning and she loves them more than anything else that she gets and she knows what time it is. her teeth have been cleaned once the vet said her teeth are perfect. i buy greenies from amazon beacause the service and the price is the best there is.  billy j.  alabama.
1;I've got two adopted rescue Chihuahuas . . . they would run me out of town on a rail if they didn't get their daily Teenie Greenies . . . Amazon has the best price around for this product . . . it's a winner all around . . .
1;My two little boys love these treats. So much in fact that I've been cutting them in half so they can have them more than once a day. I honestly can't say that they reduce tartar but I can see how they would with their chewy texture.
1;"""I have 3 90 pound dogs and I buy these in the 27 count boxes 2 at a time.<br />Each dog chews them as if they are munching on gold. It's like they are savoring each bite which is all the better for cleaning their teeth.<br />My veterinarian even noticed a difference in my dogs teeth after only 2 weeks. Like another contributor"
1;My little pom absolutely loves the Greenies Dental Chews. Amazon provides the bigger pack of 96 at a cheaper price than you can find in stores. When they arrived today I told my dog her treats were here and she knew exactly what I was talking about. She was jumping up and down and could hardly wait for me to open the package. As soon as I got it opened she grabbed her little Greenie and went to town!!
1;My dogs love the greenies and their breath is alway good smelling. A good product.<br />I purchased this through Amazon for a better prlice than I normally get.  This is an expensive little treat but worth it.
1;"""Have used greenies since they came out and they definitely help keep your dog's teeth clean. My dog gets excited about being treated to a Greenie everyday. The pricing was very attractive through Amazon"
1;"""I have two 60-65 lb greyhounds and I buy the Teenie sized greenies as a snack twice a day.  I use it as a bribe in order to get their teeth brushed.  I'm not sure how well they work for deterring tartar but they seem to love it.  Doesn't seem to cause any digestive problems as my hounds have sensitive stomachs.  Another reason why I like the teenie size is becacause they can be rationed out to last longer rather than getting the  large or X-Lg  greenie where you get fewer pieces."""
1;I used to buy these at Petsmart - not anymore!  Same exact product considerably cheaper.  I usually tack them on to other orders to take advantage of free shipping.  God forbid I don't have a supply of Greenies in the house...
1;We NEVER run out of Greenies! My little baby loves these treats. It is an added bonus that they are good for dental care as well.  Greenies got a bad rap for a while but they have been reformulated and are chewier now. We buy the teenie size for her because she is only ten pounds. My Mia dances for these treats and leads (herds) us to the treat jar for her daily fix!  Amazon has the best price for this quantity and shipping was fast!
1;"""I should take a video of my dog drooling when I ask him if he wants a Greenie!  No other treat can compare as far as he's concerned -- and this is a dog who will eat just about anything.  He happily trots into his crate every night at bedtime because he knows that's when I'll give him this special treat.  Seriously"
1;"""My dog has a very sensitive stomach and this is the only treat that agrees with her.  She gets one a day which I use to coax her onto her crate in the morning.  She saves the Greenie until I return home in the afternoon"
1;My dogs love Greenies. They are a healthy chewing snack for dogs. I was pleased to purchase Greenies at such a great price. I paid under $23.00 for a tub of 96 tiny Greenies. The same package sells for at least $10 to $15 more for the same product. I will continue to purchase this product from Amazon.com.
1;"""Our Great Dane prefers Greenies over any other treat.  She really likes the small ones.  Because they are expensive we limit her to one  special Greenie  a week.  She knows when we get the box down and gets very excited."""
1;We have been giving these dental chews to our little Pomeranian for over 3 years now. The vet always says we do a great job with brushing her teeth and gums although it is these chewies that do the job! Highly recommended!
1;My two yorkie/apso dogs come in from morning outing and get all excited waiting for their Greenie.  They've been getting one teenie size every morning for only 2 months - but their teeth and breath are looking and smelling good.  I recommend this healthy treat.
1;I buy greenies for  my two best friends.  My vet commented on how their teeth are looking good because of the greenies.  My ten year old Scottish terrier and my four year old Standard Poodle will dance circles for their greenis..lol.  How cool is that?
1;My dog goes crazy when I mention the word Greenies.  He hasn't put on any extra weight since I have been giving them to him.  He gets one per day and always lets me know when it is time to have one.  The cost is a little high so I buy them in the larger quantity.
1;"""My  Sammy  is very picky on treats but he loves these and the best thing is he is 7 and a half years old and has never had to have his teeth cleaned. The Vet says his teeth are clear of tartar so I've saved enough in Vet bills to more than pay for his special chews"""
1;My small Westie terrier absolutely loves his Greenies! I had other Westies in the past years and these were also their favorite treat. The company was sold and they changed the formula years ago and made them safer for the dogs to eat. They are the BEST!
1;I have three dogs and they get a greenie every day.  You will be amazed to see what these treats can do for your dogs teeth.  Buy on Amazon for the best value.  Some stores sell these for more than $30 a box.
1;"""Greenies have been a part of my dogs lives for nearly thirteen years and they look forward to one everyday.  I ordered them from Amazon and everything went smoothly.  I did not have a hitch in the order or length of time getting them. Thank you so much"
1;"""My dog eats a greenie a day and we were very excited to have found them here at such a great price.  The package arrived in perfect condition and they are very fresh.  I have chosen this size Greenie for my chihuahhua"
1;My friend gave me some of these greenies that were left from her dog.  I gave my dog one and he was sold.  Never thought he would eat these.  Good breath now and also is a picky eater...Quick delivery and good price.
1;"""My dog absolutely loved Greenies. He would come downstairs every morning and sit in front of the pantry until someone gave him his Greenies. He also learned to do all sort of cute tricks. We taught him these tricks with Greenies as his incentive. These treats were healthy for him"
1;My doggie goes crazy when he hears the box being opened. He has sensitive teeth and doesnt like hard stuff. These are perfect. I started using these after getting his teeth cleaned. I give him one every 2-3 days. Keeping his teeth clean.
1;My dogs LOVE Greenies!!  I have offered them a choice of Greenies or Nutri Dent several times......Greenies are their choice every time.  The Nutri Dents just don't cut it with them.  Greenies are the best!!!!
1;Superb business.  I do not think this item could have been shipped and received any quicker unless I had driven to a local store and picked it up myself.  Wish all Internet businesses would strive to do transaction this way.  Adds confidence and credibility to the e-commerce world.
1;I have been buying this product for quite some time. My dogs love them. I was disappointed at how much the price went up recently. I was also angry when I got my purchase which was advertised as 19 in a box and there were only 17.
1;"""Our Papillions love Greenies!  They help keep the tartar under control.  This breed is notorious for bad tartar build up on their teeth and having to have dentals twice a year.  With using the Greenies daily"
1;My dog loves the Greenies. He is a 12lbs pug and the Tiny size were too small for him.  These are a better size for him.  He loves them.  He recently decided that he didn't like many of his treats but he still loves these.
1;I am sad to say that my dogs are completely addicted to Greenies. They get one every night after our walk and they never let us forget. Once we get inside they go right to their crates and sit and wait until their treats are given. Good treat for small dogs and a great price on amazon.
1;my dog brandi lovessssssssssssssssssss these greenies she cant get enough of them and i keep them in cabinet she will look at cabinet and than look at me and say ma can i please have a greenie im not kiddin shes a dog but she talks to me they have there own communication.<br />anyway whoever is leary about buying these trust me when i tell you they are worth every pennie and this seller got them out to me quick!!great product great seller what more can i say but<br />merry xmas and a happy healthy new year too!!
1;Our two greyhounds love the Greenies dental chews.  I prefer to buy them the smaller treats since they are both seniors now and don't like to chew on things for extended periods of time.  The regular size fits that need.
1;My two dogs love them. All I have to say is it's greenie time. I have checked their teeth and they have improved so much. My vet recommended them and I'm glad that I bought them. Amazon delivery was fantasticly fast!
1;This is a great product. My dogs love them. In fact they will fight over who gets one first. The teenies are the perfect size. It is one of the few treats I can safely offer my smallest yorkie. They both seem to listen very well when I pull out the bag.<br /><br />My vet says that for yorkies they both have very little plague. It beats trying to use the small brushes to brush their teeth.
1;Make sure you have a small dog...Big Dogs might choke on these if they get to anxious...  But there are a ton in this box - a great value and they do whiten the teeth very well - see all the great reviews.  Help your dogs teeth if you don't want to brush them like me.
1;These are the best things since sliced bread.  I have been giving my dogs this treat for quite awhile.  My dogs love them and they were very reasonably priced.  I paid you $18.95 plus shipping and at Petsmart they are $32.99 plus tax for the exact same amount.  Thanks for the good buy.<br /><br />Sincerely<br />Danny Knowles
1;I use this particular type of agave nectar as it is recommended in my almond flour cookbook.  This size works perfectly for me.  It's not too heavy to pour a simple 1/2 cup of product and the price is way better from Amazon than from my local health food store.  This is a win-win!!  Thanks Amazon for another amazing deal.
1;"""I've been using agave for a few years now and before discovering it here on Amazon I'd generally go with what was on sale locally. I've tried several brands and most are  good  but this Madhava Light works the best for me in things like white tea or coffee where you want just the *sweet* with as little added flavor to it as possible.<br /><br />This brand also tends to be easier to find locally so I can compare prices and frequently get a really good deal from the smaller to this larger size.<br /><br />Very pleased with this product and highly recommended!"""
1;"""This product was recommended for folks with potential for type 2 diabetes...I use it in everything in place of sugar or honey...it does not raise your blood sugar and it tastes great....I also love the convenience of the container size...I could not find this size locally and the smaller bottles are much more expensive.<br /><br />I have this product sent via auto delivery"
1;We love this agave nectar.  The taste is like something between honey and syrup and it has a very low glycemic index so no problems with blood sugar issues.<br />The best price I have found as well!  Thanks
1;A healthy substitute for white sugar and other sweeteners. We use this product regularly in our household and have found that buying it through Amazon is much more economical and convenient than at the grocery store.
1;"""I have been using Madhava Agave Nectare for a few years now to sweeten primarily tea (hot and cold) but also for coffee and other drinks.  It gives just enough sweetness without the downside of refined sugar"
1;I use Agave Nectar for my Margaritas so I have this on 'Subscribe and Save' which is a great option. It comes to me automatically just when I need it at a discounted price. It was damaged only one time out of 4 shipments and it was re-shipped in time for my needs. You can't beat this price anywhere. Love it!
1;I ordered this because I wanted to replace my artficial sweetner with something natural and organic and not refined sugar. I use it in my morning coffee and liking it a lot. It's not overly sweet and mixes instantly in hot coffee. Ordering more soon!
1;"""I've ordered this several times now. I use it when I need a neutral sweetener. I find it perfect for in my tea because it does not alter the flavor of the tea like honey would. It's fairly easy to pour from this bottle"
1;I gave up sugar years ago. I'm so glad to see Amazon with this product... It's the only sweetener I use and this is the best price I've found. I buy the 46oz bottles and refill my smaller one's. Subscribe and save is the Best Value!
1;Madhava Organic Agave Nectar was supposed to be an experiment for me when I purchased the first time a couple years ago. Now it is the main sweetener I use in cooking! It is a very light tasting natural sugar substitute that I keep on hand for all baking. I never have to worry about a sugar rush or dip in blood sugar when using agave nectar. It can even be used in my new favorite drink: prickly pear agave margaritas! So good! Subscribe and Save has made it easy to do so and less expensive than buying at the grocery store. Even though more natural products have become easily available I will continue to purchase from amazon since I know that it will be fresh and shipped super quick.
1;I used this good tasting Agave in pitchers of ice tea that we drink all year long.<br />It blends in qickly and tastes real good too.  Also enjoy it on fresh fruit because<br />it brings out the flavors of the fruit rather than overtake them. It's great on anything<br />you would like to bring a touch of sweetness to.
1;I love this agave nectar and was pleased to find is at a great price on Amazon!  The shipper sent out the item quickly and we have enough to last us for a good while now.  I highly recommend this product for those looking to eliminate refined sugars from their diet.
1;Oh my gosh I had been buying 8oz bottles for $4.99 at the local grocery store when I discovered the excellent price at Amazon!  Even if you give one away it's a better deal than that!  I use agave in my fruit smoothies and this brand is excellent.  A light taste that adds the perfect sweetness.
1;Came quickly.<br /><br />I used it for the first time in baking and it has a nice sweet flavor.  Good value especially with the free shipping.  This is the first time I've used agave so can't compare it with other brands.  I can say it was sweeter than sugar and I'll be cutting down the amount I use in recipes.  I am experimenting with cooking with sugar alternatives and I liked how this one tasted.
1;"""I was skeptical for a long time about agave nectar and finally gave in and bought this!  Wow!  Wow!  This is so yummy.  I have been baking with it following Elana's Pantry recipes and everything has turned out wonderful.  It is fantastic in salad dressings"
1;"""I bought the  Light  Agave Nector which is a thinner consistency (and dissolves faster) than honey and is also sweeter than honey.  I use the Agave in hot tea with creamer and for me it's a better flavor than using honey.  However"
1;I've recently started drinking green smoothies to get healthier and had read that agave nectar is much healthier for you than refined sugars and artificial sweeteners. I add a couple of tablespoons to my smoothies. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to get healthy an all natural way!
1;Ingredients<br /><br />6 cups ice<br />1/2 cup white sugar<br />8 Hidden Valley Original Ranch Dressing 1.5-Ounce Packages<br />1/8 cup lime juice<br />1/2 cup lemon juice<br />3/4 cup rum<br />1/4 cup lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage
1;"""They were the large candy bars.  I I'm not really sure what to say.  It tasted just like a Snickers.  They arrive by UPS during the middle of our Texas heat and not a one was melted.  I was really concern about them melting"
1;Always sends the freshest product at a good price.  I've stopped shopping for Altoids at local stores because quite often the stores have an over inflated price and the Altoids are stale.  Thank you for providing this service!
1;My wife absolutely loved the basket. She is a chocolate fanatic and thought the variety of delicacies in this collection were fantastic. The truffles and chocolate chip marshmallow crispie bar were here favorites. I would highly recommend this as a gift and thought it gave great value for the price.
1;I bought about 18 of Emeril's Vegetable Stock. I can't fine it at all around where I live. Also don't save a dollar and buy the cheaper one's you will be sorry. Emeril's stock doesn't have much fat in the stock broth.
1;"""I just got in a small box of chocolates from Godiva and they were old and stale.<br />I guess you pay for the pretty box and the name.<br />Godiva is supposed to be a very old company.<br /><br />Well"
1;"""I bought two of these for my Pug puppies.  Wasn't sure if first if they would get the hang of it but it took no time at all.  Instead of the treats they suggest (which could be made of anything and could have too many calories)"
1;"""I purchased our first Busy Buddy Tug for Hudson's 1st Birthday! He is a constant busy-body and this toy provides hours of entertianment for him. My concern was the durability becasue he can chew through most everything immediately.... not this toy! It is by far the most durable!!! He did eventually chew through the rope"
1;I love this toy for my shih tzu! at first he was confused by it but now it takes him 30 min - hr to get all his kibbles out of the thing. I dont even use his food bowl anymore..<br /><br />he even runs around with it around the house...
1;I bought the Tug-A-Jug for my Yorkie and he loves to push and pull it around the room while it pops treats out. He can spend hours just playing with it. My Golden Retriever even plays with the Tug-A-Jug. I'd recommend this product to anyone who has a dog that needs a challenge and loves the mental stimulation that this product provides.
1;"""Absolutely LOVE this toy. We recently purchased this for our 8 month old French Bulldog after our trainer suggested feeding him by hand to prevent him from gobbling up his meals in 2 seconds as Frenchies do. While that's great in theory"
1;"""This toy really helps my dog slow down when she is eating dinner. Before she would eat too fast and would get sick.  Now we give her this with a cup of food and it takes her about 30 to 45 minutes to eat her dinner.  She doesn't seem to actually  play  with it (she never really plays with anything) but does like to chew on the rope."""
1;I got this toy on Amazon recommendations.  This toy has been true to form.  It has kept my 5 month old puppy engaged while I am busy preparing dinner.  I put her dog food in it and she love it. Great toy!!
1;"""My dog is food obsessed and LOVES this toy. At 4 months it took her less than a day to figure it out which was fine because now we give it to her when we leave and she spends the entire time playing with it! It is by far her favorite toy. When the food runs out she carried it over to us and begs for more. We don't bother with special treats. Her dry food works just fine and from what we have seen"
1;My Lab puppy 10 weeks loves this toy and the small is plenty big enough for her as well as my full grown Westie. They seem to love the shape and the rope. The food does not seem to be the main part of the appeal.
1;"""I've got a dog who gets bored while I'm away and in a last ditch effort I thought I'd try this product to help her keep occupied during the day and I gotta say it did it. We've only been using the jug a couple days but it has made a world of difference. It seems to have taken her a while to figure it out"
1;"""I usually am not one to submit reviews but after having used this product for two years I feel that it is definately worth a review.  I love Busy Buddy toys in generalfor my Cairn Terrier and this Tug-A-Jug tops them all.  The bottles that I have always had are in the size small and have an actual rope in the bottle"
1;awesome toy! my pup loves this.  he did already manage to scratch the crap out of the bottom and make cracks in the bottom due to his teething.  he didn't get it at first til i showed him how to hit the bottle to get the food out.  keeps him entertained for 5-10 mins at a time.  we love it.
1;"""I got this for my GR puppy at about 6 mths old but she didn't quite know how to get the treats out. However by 9 months old she figured it out and loves it! I give her kibble in here about 3-4 times a week and she gets it all out (1 cup) within about 20 minutes. Make sure you are away from breakable things though because if your dog whips it around and tosses it - like mine does"
1;"""This can be a tough mental challenge for a dog. My 60 lb. mostly Dingo mix's strategy is to pick it up by the bottle and let it drop on the rope. When the rope hits the ground a few kibbled treats are released. This was tough for him to figure out. However"
1;We have a mouthly labrador & this toy keeps him out of trouble.  He will carry it around all day long.  Don't leave it outdoors with food or it gets moldy as you would suspect.  My big lab loves his toy!  I prefer the one with the rubber handle over the fabric/rope handle.  Easier to clean.
1;I am really surprised out just how much they do love them.  They quit playing with their other toys and carry these around with them.  I have 2 of the x-small and 1 of the med/large which is really big.  Some of them have a rope and some have a rubber rope.  It seems a little harder to get out treats with the regular rope because of the size of it.  It really makes your dogs work for the treats and keeps them occupied for a long time.  You can even take the rope out and put in a golf ball but the treats do come out easier with this method.  My dogs have slammed these things around and there has been no breakage of the product.  I have 2 German Shepherds so they are pretty tough on toys.  I also like the fact that you can fill these up ahead of time and then give to dogs later when you are leaving.
1;"""The tug-a-jug keeps my boarder collie busy for hours! I just put her normal food in the jug and she thinks it's a game to get the food! It is wonderful.  I don't sugest using it in any rooms with glass doors (like on an entertainment center) though"
1;"""As other people have noticed this isn't something that you should leave your dog alone with all day.  Given that caveat I think this is an amazing product!  I actually have 2 (one for each dog) and it is their favorite way to get a meal.  It keeps them occupied for about 10-15 minutes but you can tell they are thinking and having a blast and they are generally ready to settle down and relax for a bit afterwards.  I have one with a real rope and one with a rubber rope.  Each has benefits and downsides.  I would recommend getting the large even for little dogs"
1;"""Our 16 month old yellow lab loves to play with empty 2 liter pop bottles.  I bought him this toy because I worried he would cut his mouth and gums on the sharp plastic shards of those flimsy bottles.  No worry about that with the Tug-a-Jug...this toy will most likely survive through the next millennium!<br /><br />To fill with treats"
1;"""I have a 13 week old Goldendoodle who is fiesty and playful. We have several interactive toys and this is one of Boomer's favorite! We use it all the time but lately my husband who takes care of him in the early morning has been away so I've been on duty 24/7"
1;"""We bought this for our 5 month old lab to keep her from inhaling her dinner in 5 seconds flat. We have now purchased 2 more as gifts for other dog owners.<br /><br />It took our dog a day and a half to figure this toy out. At first she barked at it since she was frustrated that she could see and smell her kibble but couldn't get to it. After a few happy mistakes with pawing at it and watching us pull the rope"
1;Our 8 mo old standard poodle loves this toy!  It took her awhile to figure out how it worked and it's still a challenge.  We use it to feed her regular meals and for entertainment and she never gets tired of playing with it.
1;Our dog trainer recommended this as a way for our terrier mix to work off some of her extra energy.  It was really slow going at first -- she couldn't figure out how to get the food out so she gave up really easily. About two weeks after we got it she finally figured it out and it is FANTASTIC.  It used to take her 30 seconds to finish her meals from a bowl and now it's about 20-30 minutes that keeps her fully occupied!  It has been the most valuable thing we've gotten for our dog!
1;I give this to my Lab-border collie mix. He inhales his food it's better for his digestion to slow down. It took him less than two days to become proficient with it. After about two weeks we stuck this nubby football toy sold at Complete Petmart in the bottle to slow him and keep him busy longer. It's just the right size to fill the bottle yet allow food to flow down. We do shake it a bit to get the flow started. Using this method it takes him about and hour and half to get all of the food out. He still gets to inhale his food and pester us sometimes it depends on what we're doing. I'd reccomend it and the nubby football to go inside if you have extra smart dog. If you google football dog toy in google images you will come across an example of the type of toy we used.
1;"""I bought the small size for my 2 dachshunds (who are notorious for chewing through monster truck tires and tearing the heads off barbie dolls).  This toy has kept them busy for 2 1/2 days and still going strong.<br /><br />The bottom screws off to EASILY put food in (I put in their dinner portion of kibble plus a couple bone treats).  The bottom has pin size air holes so the dogs can smell the food"
1;My 1 year old Border Collie absolutely loves it! It's hard to keep him entertained and this tug-a-jug worked like a charm. I was also amazed that he wasn't able to destroy it....always a plus in my book. [...]. I would recommend to any owner looking for entertainment for their dog.
1;"""Our Jack Russell is a real chow hound and just `wolves' down her food.  We now serve Wendy all her dinners in the Tug-a-Jug.  At first she was quite frustrated but we mixed some small kibble with the regular size and she was rewarded enough to keep working on it.  Now we simply toss in a couple handfuls of kibble screw the top back on and dinner lasts 15-20 minutes instead of the 2 minute bowl feast.  Some reviewers didn't like the plastic rope in this newer version"
1;This toy is great! My dog loves it! I feed my dog his food in it so he doesn't eat too fast. At the beginning it took sometime for him to learn how to get the treats out but now he eats a whole cup in 15 minutes or so.
1;My golden retriever absolutely loves his tug a jug! It gives him a fun challenge while trying to get his food out of there and it keeps him occupied for a while. It is a great design! I want to get another one for him.
1;"""My dog is a mixed breed Corgi/Beagle/Terrier.  We have spend hundreds of dollars on toys for him in his 11mths. of life.  He even bit through his 3 Kong's.  This is the only toy that has lasted.  He ripped the rope off after a few days"
1;"""I have a 7lb Maltese boy who loves this toy! I was a little hesitant when I first received it because it is about half as big as he is. It took him a little while to figure out how to get the treats out but he definitely has his methods now. From dragging it around the living room to standing it up by the couch and knocking it back over. Also keeps his interest for a very long time whether it has treats in it or not!!!! I would recomend this to keep your canine pal entertained.<br />My furbaby loves to have kibble or multi-grain cherios plus some biscuits in his!****<br /><br />*****5 months later and I had to write an update. Gizmo is still in love with this toy. He loves to pull it around and scratch on the bottle to see if he can get at the rope"
1;"""<span class= tiny > Length:: 1:06 Mins<br /><br /></span>I was skeptical when I bought this toy because of all the reviews I read of people reporting that their dogs couldn't figure out how to use it. My pup figured out a strategy within about 5 minutes. It continues to be a useful toy for times when I want to keep her busy"
1;I have had this toy for three months. My big dog loves plastic bottles and will assume every water bottle is meant for her so I was curious about how this toy would go over. It was a definite hit!  She loves it and ever after the beagle has tried to destroy it you can hardly see a mark on it!  At least as far as dogs are concerned I think this might be indestructible.
1;"""I have a 6 month lab/ husky mix that no joke-- INHALED his food in ten seconds.. Today when I put his food in the tug a jug... it took him a whole 30 minutes to get a cup and a half of food out! Mornings are usually rough for us-- dog wants to eat"
1;We bought this toy for our Malteese and she loves it. We stuck honey nut cheerios inside it and she plays with it for hours trying to get them out. Once she got a few out she couldn't stop playing with it. It is made very well.
1;I got this toy for my two pomeranians and the boy just loves it. He has a high food drive anyway but just put some good smelling treats in this and he will play with it until they all come out. It's easy to load with just a few but if you put their whole day's food in it you have to hold you hand over the rubber ball so they won't spill out.
1;"""My Lab Mix loves this toy.  When he was a pup he had a hard time figuring it out and would get frustrated and just bark at it.  But as he got older he tossed it around enough to get some food out.  What really helped was sitting down with him and shaking some out"
1;My white Germany Shepherd puppy is 5 months old and this toy keeps her occupied for hours on end. I recommend starting out with tiny treat bits to get your dog hooked at this game as it is more rewarding. As your dog gets a hang of it you can increase its difficulty by increasing treat size.
1;"""Labs like to work for their food.  This makes him work in spades.  Keeps him occupied for longer than any other food dispensing toy we have used and it doesn't require special food.  Just use kibble.<br /><br />Easy to fill"
1;"""I heard the inventor on a local radio station one day Talking about her Boston terrier who tore up all his toys and she said that's why she invented this. I was a little unsure that this would keep my little # 3 BT  busy"
1;"""The busy buddy is one of my favorite toys I have bought my dog. He loves it and it usually takes him about 20 minutes to get all the treats out (I don't fill it all the way up). I haven't tried to put his food in it"
1;My Great Dane puppy LOVES this toy when I put a couple treats inside.  He has the large one that has the rubber piece instead of the rope piece.  It's super durable and he drags it around gnawing on the end of it till he works the treats loose.
1;"""I had to review this toy because it is one of VERY few that has not been destroyed within days (sometimes minutes).  Very good durability - the rattling of treats in the jar and the difficulty of getting to them perplexed my golden mix.  She likes this toy"
1;"""I loved the tug a jug it keeps our puppy busy during meal times.  He figured it out on the first day but still enjoys it.  We don't use it every day but save it for those times when we want to keep him busy during special meals.  I would highly recommend this for bored"
1;I had the regular size one and recently purchased the x-small. I am so happy they came out with the x-small one. It is holding up really well. I'm surprised some people say it doesn't hold up. The first one I got wouldn't die. My dog never was destructive with it. I think it is an awesome toy and I highly recomend it.
1;"""I was looking for a durable toy that would hold the interest of my 5 month old Border Aussie puppy and the Tug-a-Jug has been a great find. He was a little hesitant of it at first but once he figured out that the toy dispensed food"
1;"""Purchased for my four year old Dobie  grandson . He's a full blown case of a four legged kid who has a terminal case of the  terrible twos .<br /><br />Daughter said  it didn't take him long to figure out how to make the treats spill out. She loads it with dehydrated banana and papaya chips and it keeps him occupied for a good 45 minutes with each fill.<br /><br />He's figured out the bottom comes off and tries to find ways to take the bottom off"
1;I bought this to keep my pug mix occupied while I was out of the house. It is very durable hard plastic. I put half of her daily dog food in there when I leave and it keeps her busy for a long time! I was worried she would shake it and break something but she doesn't shake it at all. This toy is a great idea.
1;We got this toy to keep my 6 month puppy busy when we went to work. It's a great toy for dogs that inhale their food and need some stimulation so they keep out of trouble. My dog is not a light chewer so I was worried that he would chew this to pieces but after a couple of months this toy remains intact. LOVE IT!
1;"""This is one of the greatest inventions for Dogs that either eat too fast or need to be preoccupied with something to do. We have been using the jug about 8 months and have stopped feeding our dog with the dog dish and now only use the Jug. It takes him several minutes to get his food out"
1;"""I got this when a trainer recommended that I find ways to make life more entertaining for my dog. Apparently dogs find working for their dinner to be entertaining. It actually is really great. I just unscrew the bottom"
1;"""I have a basset hound who loves to get in trouble if he's not occupied.  He's also highly motivated by food.  These two things make the tug a jug perfect for him.  I started him by taking the rope plug out initially (this can easily by done by unscrewing the jug and pulling the plug through).  I lined the rim with peanut butter and put his meal inside.  He quickly learned that rolling it around and tipping it made it dispense food.  After a couple of days of this"
1;Keeps my choc lab puppy happy for a long time. Started using it to feed her meals so she doesnt inhale her food haha overall she loves it and durable to. If she hasnt destroyed it yet most dogs should be fine!
1;"""I am so happy I found this product! Charlie can break through almost any toy but not this one. I was very surprised by how thick the  jug  is (I purchased the large.) He loves chewing on the rope which is rubber and so far it has not been broken. The dry food I put inside comes out in the right amount"
1;"""We were using a kong treat dispenser ball before which our dog would just toss until all the treats came out and if they didn't come out easily she would just stop playing with it.<br /><br />The tug a jug is great because it requires a more complicated effort on the dog's part to get the treat out.  She finally figure out how to put it upright"
1;I have a 6 month old lab puppy who is way too smart for her own good.  She is into everything and I swear suffers from ADD.  I got this so I could have a few moments peace and it worked!  Now she has to work for her dinner and it gives me 1/2 hour at a time not to have to worry about her getting into other stuff.
1;"""I'm an older mother with my first child and I make all of my baby's food at home to avoid any unwanted ingredients and to make sure that my child has the freshest and best tasting food possible.  All his food EXCEPT for the NurturMe products that is!  I found their peas and apples while I was on vacation and was completely shocked at how fresh"
1;This is a good dog food for a dogs hair and skin after giving this brand to my dog for a couple of weeks his coat feels like cotton<br /><br />Here is the part where amazon is ripping you off this same size bag the 20 pounder is only $24.19 at Wal-Mart if it is not in the store near you  check wal-Mart.com I Love amazon.com but they really got this one wrong
1;I eat steel cut oatmeal almost every morning and I was so happy to discover this sweetener.  Just the right amount of maple flavor and not too sweet.  I'd much rather use agave than something artificial or pre-sweetened.  I'm sure it would also be delicious on pancakes or maybe even ice cream!  YUM!
1;"""This product (I think) is better than the  fake  maple syrups (check their labels--most contain NO MAPLE SYRUP AT ALL!) The difference in calories is absolutely amazing (the brand with the rustic wintery retreat pictured on the label has 200 calories per serving and the agave 60!) I can pronounce and spell both ingredients in the agave -- can't do that for the  fake  stuff!! The first time I tried it I just served it heated in a pitcher- the way I usually serve syrup- the kids & grandson loved it & thought I had found the  Perfect Brand!!  I think I have!  I couldn't remember where I bought it--spent weeks looking then found it at Amazon.com!!  No-brainer- ordered a case & shared!  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035MV1VC >Sohgave! Maple Flavor Agave Syrup"
1;"""When I was little I remember my family would make  cafe con leche  - the old style way - and I could never quite get the taste right now that I'm an adult -when trying to make it. When I first opened a can of Nescafe Cafe Con Leche it brought back memories! It is the closest thing to  cafe con leche  that you'll get in a can - I just add a little sugar and it is absolutely delicious. Those of you who grew up drinking cafe con leche should try this :)"""
1;I purchased these for my mother in a nursing home and she loves this size because of the container.  She does not have to find a bowl.  She can have these in her room and it really beats buying a large box for her.
1;Spelt pretzels with fiber are hard to come by.  Organic to boot!  My family used to eat Vita Spelt until I realized there was no fiber in them and they weren't organic.  Much cheaper on Amazon than in Whole Foods.
1;"""These are hearty tasting pretzels made with Spelt flour.  They have just the right amount of salt.  Even my husband won't eat regular pretzels anymore when I have these in the house.  The bonus is that nutritionally speaking"
1;"""These Pretzels are great!!  I needed an alternative to wheat and found these spelt pretzels.  I had them prior to ordering them on Amazon so I knew to expect they'd be awesome.  Several family and friends have tasted them and can't tell any difference to pretzels made with wheat.  However"
1;These pretzels are just the best! The whole grain gives them a richer flavor than regualar pretzels and the slightly thicker stick is just the ticket for a crunchier/chewier more full flavor treat. I buy them by the case!
1;"""We buy the organic spelt pretzels by Newman's Own. This company sends them fast and so nicely - packed and separated in individual slots so they don't break or pop open. The pretzels themselves are yummy. Lately we've been dipping into different mustard flavors - a great snack! A good variety of non-salted ones mixed with some salty ones"
1;At the office I am surrounded by hungry snackers when I pull out these pretzels! I even order them in bulk with of my co-workers.<br />They have a slightly dry taste compared with conventional pretzels but the nutritional content can't be beat. I love feeding my body with the complete protein and fiber the chickpea and wheat combo provide. I have and will continue to order these yummy snacks!
1;"""A pretzel is a pretzel right?  Wrong.  I was amazed at how these really taste better than any I have had before.  I think these are the best tasting pretzel rods you can get in a supermarket or here on amazon.<br /><br />The malt really makes a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />The diameter is perfect for dipping in mustard or eating plain"
1;Newman's Own Pretzels are by far the best I have ever had.  We can get their pretzel sticks at a local store but I always preferred rods and these are much better than Snyder's.  The fact that the ingredients list is short and sweet is just gravy.
1;"""These are the thin style pretzels that are truly  thin  which is what my family likes.  Many  thin  pretzels are very thick.  The best thing about these is they are organic and a  Newman's Own product"
1;We had never eaten spelt before we ate these pretzels....We love them.  I love the fact that spelt has protein in it.  Typical pretzels have less nutritional value to them.  I feel good about giving them to my family.
1;I really enjoyed the Spelt Pretzels.  They were less chalky/dry than other pretzels and had a nice mildly nutty/buttery flavor.  The four (4) grams of fiber per serving were also an added plus.  I purchased these from a local grocery story for $3.79 for one (1) bag.
1;"""I fell in love with Picamas on a family trip to Guatemala a couple of years ago. I've been nursing one large bottle that we brought back with us because I didn't know when I'd be able to find another. It is just a delicious hot sauce"
1;"""I have been using Equal sweetener for a very long time.  The amount I paid for the pack of 8 jars was so much cheaper than the amount at the store.  I am thrilled to have gotten my favorite sweetner for such a deal.  In my opinion"
1;"""I have found the Stevita brand to be the best with the least after taste because they use a natural process of amino acids to strip the Stevia leaves.  I especially like the toffee flavor which I put in my fake coffee.  It is evidently a popular flavor because it is often out of stock on the various website that sell it.  I don't use caffiene and real coffee has a wickedly bitter after taste.  Stevia has completely replaced sugar in my kitchen.  I use it in everything from cereal to baking.  This is a good price.  I like the Sweet Leaf cream soda"
1;I am on a strict diet and Stevia was recommended by my doctor to sweeten up my coffee.  I have tried vanilla (great as well) but the toffee gave it a hint of carmel which I really like.  Highly recommend (as opposed to the flavored coffee creamers that are loaded with fat and hydrogenated oils!)
1;Me and my mom went in on a box of the assorted flavor mentos.  I must admit my 15 rolls were gone in about two weeks.  The were individually wrapped and just as fresh as buying them at the store.  I give them five thumbs up.
1;This tea has a pleasant cinnamon like aroma and has a cinnamony/Carob like flavor. It take longer to brew but is worth it! It takes the edge off stress and is an enjoyable tea for morning or nightime! I take it in the morning 1/2 hour before stressfull meetings and 1/2 hour before I go to sleep if it has been a stressful day. I like to stock up so I am prepared when things get tense!
1;"""So I've had my fair share of green and black teas. I received this certain tea as a present from a good friend. I cannot tell you how amazing this tea is.<br />It's got two things going for it: It tastes awesome and is pleasant to consume.<br />Taste is a big deal. This tea tastes amazing and there is just a burst of amazing spices and flavours that come out of this tea.<br />Downing something is not healthy. If you're consuming something for everything but taste then you're doing it wrong. I enjoy this tea because it goes down nice and smooth and leaves a very pleasant after taste. As one reviewer said"
1;I purchased this for a wedding cake I recently made. My client LOVED the flavor. It isn't too overpowering and has just the right scent.<br /><br />I will certainly be buying this everytime I need more. By the way...a little goes a long way!
1;"""I only bought a dram of the Champagne flavored oil to try it. I used the dram of flavoring in my nieces wedding cake and everybody raved about it.  A couple of people really tried to guess what the flavor was"
1;I was a little leary of getting my favorite frozen juice in a can.It is very good and had a good expiration date.I just orcered the 24 pack and will be interested to see the expiration date.It is so nice to have one less thing to haul home from the grocery.The price on the 12 pack is good and the 24 pack is priced even lower.Now if I could only buy groceries on my Kindle.....
1;"""Only citric and ascorbic acid with Grape concentrate and water ! No sugar added ! And nothing else ! Delicious ? Consumed half a can before adding any water ! True Love ! Three times stronger then regular grape juice. And Welch's too !! According to   Miracle Food Cures from the Bible   (also Amazon) Grape sugar is really good for the heart. Not to mention all the antioxidants. In short"
1;"""I work 12 hour days and lived on coffee and Gatorade .... Until I tried VitaminWater Essential.  It has replaced forever my other cold beverages.  Soda and other soft drinks were just too sicky-sweet to drink all day long. I found the Essential orange flavor just right. It has a long way to go to replace my coffee (hehehe)"
1;Cocoa Krispies are great!!  I eat chocolate cereals all the time and consider myself a chocolate cereal expert!  I would say these are better than Cocoa Pebbles because they stay crunchier longer.  In my top 3 best chocolate cereals
1;Bought these with subscribe and save plus a coupon code.  My kid loves these!  They were cheaper to buy here versus using coupons at the grocery store.  But I would only buy them here on sale.  The regular price is too much.
1;I love this pancake syrup. I've been using it for 4 or 5 years. I mix it with organic pure maple syrup. One third pure maple syrup and 2/3 pancake syrup. Make sure to keep both refrigerated. They will spoil if kept in a kitchen cabinet.
1;This item was just what I was looking for .<br />Some 60 year's ago I use to get these cone's  for a penny<br />at our local paper store.<br />Was thrilled to find them for my granddaughter to enjoy too ..<br />Wonderful find ...
1;"""I love this mac and cheese. I switched to whole wheat pasta a few years ago and this is one of the best alternatives that fit the traditional American dish. I mix it with a can of tuna and I could eat it every night of the week. You do have to cook the noodles longer because they are more dense than the processed enriched noodles you get at the store. I've managed to convert my husband to the whole wheat pasta"
1;return macaroni and sauce to pan and heat until desired consistency is reached.<br />I find that the flavor of Annie's is really much better than anything else out there.  Not too salty with a great cheese taste.
1;Amazon has the best price around for this product.  It's Organic.  It's whole wheat.  It tastes great.  I like the fuller taste (and healthier characteristics) of the whole wheat.  Our daughter loves it and you don't have to feel guilty about giving it to her.  Throw in veggies or tuna or eat it plain - it's a good meal.
1;"""My toddler son loves this mac and cheese.  My husband and I enjoy it too.  The whole wheat shells don't have an overwhelming wheat flavor and the cheese is mild.  I followed the directions on the box and it was perfect"
1;I've been purchasing Annie's products for about a year. They are a healthy alternative to other artificial junk foods. This is a great price too. It's normally $2.99 per box at the local market. Whole wheat pasta shells with white cheddar cheese is delicious!
1;"""IN A NUTSHELL: THIS REALLY MADE ME INTO A BELIEVER IN 'CERTIFIED ORGANIC' PRODUCTS<br /><br />Everything that one could want in a boxed 'Macaroni & Cheese' meal is in this excellent product from 'Annie's Homegrown'. Its ingredients are 'Certified Organic'"
1;Thai Chili Roasted Garlic by Wild Tymes is the best. I take an 8oz block of cream cheese and spread about 3 tablespoons of the Thai Chili on top and serve with Triscuit crackers. It has been very popular at my home parties. Plus the cream cheese cuts down on the spicy heat.
1;"""i ran across this over the winter and spread about 1/3 of it over a block of cream cheese and served it with crackers. guests ate it up and asked where i got it.<br /><br />i quickly ran out and inadvertently threw the jar away before jotting down the name. went back to where i got it (an emporium)"
1;The only drawback is that some cans are dented. Otherwise the Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate Salmon Dinner goes over well with my cats. Some of my cats are finiky and won't eat a lot of different flavors. But Salmon is one that ALL my cats like.
1;This is my cats favorite flavor!  She prefers Pate and Salmon is her favorite pate.  It is always hard to find in the stores and is always out if there's a sale.  Buy it here on the subscription plan to save even more money.  Your cat will love you!
1;I'm changing my kitty's food from dry to wet.  I tried many different flavors but this is his favorite.  I mixed it with dry food for the first three days and then gave him just the canned Salmon and he licked the bowl clean.
1;"""I really liked this tea. It tastes smooth and herby without bitterness (if not steeped too long) and also it can be steeped for the second time (as the instruction on the can indicate) and still produce a good cup of tea.<br /><br />The price is in my opinion unbeatable"
1;The serving recommendations on the can don't seem to be correct. I really didn't like the tea as they recommended brewing it.<br /><br />I suggest you use only 1 tsp per 8oz. Boil water and let cool to 180 degrees.<br /><br />1st: 1 min<br />2nd: 30 seconds<br />3rd: 1.5 min
1;I first tasted this wonderful black tea six years ago in Ireland and was amazed.  No tea can compare with the rich flavor.  Since then I have bought Barry's Gold Blend tea through a coffee importer--it is the only tea I drink.  Now I see that it is available on Amazon--fabulous!
1;I received this yesterday and decided to give it a shot. I took 3/4 of a teaspoon along with 3/4 of a teaspoon of their california poppy and went to bed. I woke up about 4 hours later after having the most VIVID dream EVER!!! I remember waking up giggling and all I could say was WOW that was AWESOME!!! I HIGHLY recommend trying this!!!!
1;"""My 16 year old german shepherd mix scratched all the fur off her abdomen. We brought her to the vets and nothing worked. Switched to Avoderm Baked Lamb and Brown Rice and she stopped scratching and the fur came back gradually until now she is back to normal. She had cataracts and could hardly see and her eyes gradually cleared and she can see well enough to catch a toy thrown to her. She had arthritic hip displasia and had to stretch for 10-15 minutes in the morning before she could walk. Now she hops right up in the morning and bounces around the house with our two younger dogs (one a year old). We determined by switching around dog foods that the shepherd is allergic to chicken. Just about all other dog foods have chicken meal or something chicken added to them. The ingredients in this dog food are baked lamb (not lamb meal) and the preservative is vitamin e rather than artificial preservatives. This is the only dog food that works well with all our dogs. I have only found one other prepared dog food with as much or more protein per mass. I am not even sure that advertised claim is accurate. Although the price is high"
1;We use this food for our two Welsh Corgis.  One has food allergies so he can't have any chicken.  The other has a slightly sensitive stomach so the non-baked version of this didn't work for her.  The food is about a half inch in diameter so it forces them to chew rather than gulp it down like they tend to like to do even for smaller dogs. They love it.  We think it's a better grade than most non-super-premium foods without all of the hype.  They're skin and coats are perfect with this food too.  This is on my regular re-order list.
1;"""I was very happy with this tasty coffee. The beans are small and very flavorful. It makes me wonder if young coffee beans are preferable to fully grown ones. Hills Brothers has been in this business for a long time. They know what they're doing. Very nice"
1;"""I was hesitant at making the sacrifice of giving up coffee due to blood pressure issues but the chocolate flavor is  nice switch!  Its NOT true coffee but I am looking more for the morning ritual of putting coffee into a coffee maker"
1;I am Canadian and live in the States and these cookies were a staple in our house as my father was Scottish. I could never find shortbread cookies (Walkers) down here in the store except at Christmas time. When I found them on the Amazon website I bought 6 boxes and I am not sharing them with anyone. They are so good and they are mine all mine.
1;I find this noodle bowl to be the most savory and easiest way to get a quick lunch.  It only needs 3 minutes to make in the microwave and when you have only a half hour for lunch time matters.<br /><br />Try it I promise you will buy it by the case like i do.
1;"""these are VERY GOOD for making chocolate chip cookies or anything else your chocolate chunk heart desires! way better than store brand chocolate chips that  happen  to be vegan because store brand versions of things are so cheap!! highly recommended for the chocolate loving baker -- vegan or not!"""

For the record i'm a very picky eater.<br /><br />The reason why i say $20 is because the can says cat food. If someone added some chicken broth and threw it in a bowl with some egg noodles"
1;"""I've tried just about every kind of canned food there is and the only kind I can get my cats to eat is very expensive. I tried this and all three of my cats gobbled it up...in fact one was snorting while eating it. Even the picky little one loved it. The first ingredient is boneless white chicken"
1;"""I grew up in a house where as kids we would beg my mother to make Swedish pancakes from scratch (which is alot of work) so we didn't get them that often. I was out driving around the back country roads in Ma and came across this authentic country store. While I was browsing"

1;"""Silk Pure Almond is a very tasty alternative to soy or rice milk. It's thicker than rice milk and just as creamy as soy milk. The taste is not what you would expect either--it's not very  nutty  tasting. It mixes well with just about anything"
1;This is the best almond milk I've ever tasted!!! (vanilla flavor is even sweeter) and it is the only almond milk I know that doesn't contain Carrageenan (which is not good for you) I used to drink other Silk milks such as very vanilla soy milk...but switched to this when I got pregnant. I didn't want to feed my baby with carrageenan.I wish Silk company could find a way to not use carrageenan in any of their milks! But this one is my favorite!!!
1;We are a dairy free family and use Silk Pure Almond Milk everyday in our cereal and as a drink. Fantastic stuff! We buy both refrigerated and shelf almond milk. These are about the same price as buying it from the dairy section at the grocery store. We buy them for food storage. These came in handy for us this week when the snow came in. We didn't have to rush to the grocery store to buy milk because we were covered. :) I love Silk!
1;"""Please be aware that these are 6 32 oz (1 quart) packages and not half gallons as you may believe. The good thing about this is the shelf life of the packages. A normal half gallon is good for about as long as a regular milk product. These are good for months until you open them and then they are good for 10 to 14 days.  I use them to make a protein shake with fresh bananas that I have frozen. I use a non-dairy protein powder and it all tastes great.  Once I open the carton"
1;the taste shocked me.....i instantly tasted it comparing it to the 2% i have been drinking all my life...and when you have those expectations it will let you down..when i got over it i noticed it just taste like liquid almonds and i love almonds so its very nice to me...and if you like almonds i don't see why you wouldn't like the taste
1;These chips are fabulous!  If you are looking for a great Gluten Fee chip that is not genetically engineered you've found it!  Add some hummus and you are in heaven!  These chips are perfect.  I like this one because it is simple goodness with nothing added except sea salt.
1;"""My doctor recommended the normal 5-hour energy several years ago when I was having mid day slumps and required naps. It worked great while I needed it. Now I have switched to this. I add it to a smoothies about half an hour before I hit the gym and my workouts are great"

1;The size of these little tubs is just perfect for sauting a skillets worth of home fries with onions. What's not to love about duck fat! It adds a great taste to so many different dishes and the small tubs save on waste and last forever.
1;"""I had been thinking for sometime to look for Graisse de Canard and where else to look but Amazon !!!!Was not dissapointed. This is a great product at a good price. I use it of course to saute all kinds of vegetables and in the near future will make my own Confit de Canard"
1;I am an avid coffee drinker and I was very pleased with the taste of this coffee. It was not as strong as other coffees and just left behind a really great french roasted taste. It also did not leave an after taste
1;"""Finally! A delicious coffee has been created that doesn't send my stomach for a ride on the acid roller coaster. I am able to enjoy several cups of this wonderfully aromatic coffee without any trouble - a first for me. It was such a hit with me that I ended up ordering the Mocha Java flavor. Not exactly the best Mocha Java ever"
1;"""The reason I'm not sure of the other reported benefits/claims is that I do not suffer from gastro issues related to coffee - other than the first cup assisting in getting things moving in the AM.  I happen to like bold"
1;I drink another low acid coffee so when this showed up on Vine I requested a sample.  I got a 3 oz bag and made 2 small pots of coffee.  I found the taste to be bold.  It reminded me of Starbucks Dark Roast.  There was not an aftertaste.  The coffee was smooth and did not cause me any trouble.  If you like dark roast and have trouble with coffee this is a good coffee to try.  The price is in line with other coffee of the same type and is cheaper than some.

1;Puroast  Low Acid Coffee in French Roast is excellent.  It brews well and there is no loss of taste with it being low acid.  It<br />still tastes like full bodied French Roast and has a delicious smooth taste and nice color.  I have been disappointed in other low acid coffees but this met all my expectations for a full bodied cup of coffee without the acid stomach upset.
1;"""OK I know cute tittle! Let me first say I received this product free as part of amazon.com's VINE Program to generate reviews. I have has heartburn/acid reflux since I was a teenager (yes nervous kid) and I am always looking for low acid products. This Puroast Low Acid coffee taste great"
1;"""I just got a sample [3-ounce bag] of this  Dark French Roast  via mail -- and brewed it immediately via Gevalia drip machine to full European expresso concentration. It indeed has the rich deep dark chocolate aspect of a traditional Dark French Roast -- but not bitter [beyond the strong dark roast aspect] and indeed no notable acidic aspect. As for drinking modes -- I tried it hot and black by itself [not at all my usual way] -- hot with brown sugar and a little cream -- then cold with lots of cream and ice -- and finally with real French vanilla added to that"
1;I'm not much of a coffee drinker and prefer tea but thought I'd give this a go. I've never been a huge fan of the after taste I get with most coffee and that is where this one surprised me. It didn't have the same bitter after taste I was expecting. I tried it plain and found it bearable (keep in mind my lack of coffee taste) and then with some milk and sugar which I really enjoyed. To make sure I was enjoying the coffee I kept my sugar and milk in check so it was a cup of coffee with milk and sugar and not a cup of milk and sugar with some coffee added. That said the expense of the coffee may keep most none coffee connoisseur away but if you are in the none coffee club but are thinking of crossing over this is worth a try.
1;"""I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of this coffee as I wasn't sure what to expect with an  acid reduced  coffee. I generally like to drink a medium roast coffee as dark roast usually gives me an unpleasant after-taste and indigestion. However"
1;"""I tried the Puroast low acid French Roast coffee and I really liked the taste and the smoothness of the coffee.  The fact it was low acid enabled me to have a second cup of coffee without experiencing any of the discomfort in my stomach I would have with my regular coffee"
1;"""This coffee was satisfying.  I prepared it in a Kuerig machine using the one cup mesh filter and had no grounds seep through even though the grind was fine. I enjoyed my morning coffee and was surprised to find a pleasant after taste unlike the ones I usually experience that sending me running for mouthwash to eradicate  coffee breath.   I attribute this smooth taste to the low acid content.  I usually drink a full bodied bold coffee but could switch to this for the benefit of the low acid."""
1;My sister and I are both having problems with coffee acidity and this package is wonderful.  The taste is great and really smooth going down.  Neither of us has had any problem with this pot of coffee and will look for more.
1;This coffee delivers on its claim.  It was very smooth and had no residual acid to it.  The taste was very good.  I'd highly recommend this coffee although it is a little pricey but if you get heartburn and love coffee it's for you!
1;"""Got to hand it to them - it is a smooth cup of coffee. My sample was the Dark French Roast. Normally I do not care much for French Roast because it is over cooked in my opinion.<br /><br />I drank it black to get a good sense of the flavor. Since it is darkly roasted it doesn't have a lot of subtle tones to it like lighter roasts have. It has the twang that this level of roast imparts on coffee and"
1;I am someone who suffers from stomach ulcers and so when I saw this coffee I'd jump at the opportunity to buy it .  it was much easier on my stomach and finally I was able to enjoy coffee again highly recommended
1;This coffee is the best decaf coffee you will ever taste. We finally found this coffee after trying dozens of other decaf coffees and it is so rich and flavorful that you wouldn't know that it a decaf coffee.
1;I thought that the white pepercorn was such a deal. The only place in town that carried white peppercorn is Whole Food with costs 6.99 for 1.7 oz. For the price of 8.99 plus 3.99 postage you get 16 oz. It came to the house in about 3 days and works great in my peppermill. If you you a lot of white peppercorn or mix with black peppercorn it's a great deal!<br />Pam
1;"""I received my white peppercorns today. I was very happy with them. They were sealed in an airtight plastic bag. And the shipping package was secure so as not to damage the products. When I opened the bag the smell of the peppercorns was amazing. They were all whole(none broken). I can't wait to cook with them. I use white pepper in potatoes"
1;"""The white peppercorns arrived as promised and are of better quality than I expected. I wish I would've ordered a larger bag because my husband and I use a lot of white pepper when we cook and serve meals. You bet I will be placing another order very soon"
1;"""I love the Udi's gluten free granola! I have had the plain and the cranberry flavors and they are both great. I have it for breakfast with my yogurt or as a snack right out of the bag. Definitely recommend this product. Clearly says on the bag everything it does not contain (like the big common allergens- gluten"
1;This granola is awesome!! You would never guess it is gluten free. I was so tired of not being able to enjoy granola until I tried this. I buy the au natural plain one and I add milk to it and make it a cereal and it is delicious!!
1;"""The pink color is very nice and bright. I made some candy hearts and they came beautifull. I also used it for cake pops but it have to be mixed with a little amount of paramount crystals to be liquid enough for coating the cake pops. It's liquids much better than Wilton's.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008DI8OY >Paramount Crystals</a>"""
1;"""Yesterday my friend shared with me a bag of this Pom-Raspberry snack from his 12-pack box. The bite-sized crunch is lightly sweet and delicious.  I was instantly hooked and got online to do a lot of research because I had a serious doubt about food products made in China. I really hoped this product would have a clean bill of health so I would feel comfortable buying it regularly.<br /><br />I should say that Mrs. May's website erased a big part of my concerns. First of all"
1;Good quality brand cat food.  My cats don't like anything else. Price is affordable.  Have been feeding my cats this brand of cat food for the last 10 years.  They offer several varieties so my cats don't get bored with the same thing.
1;"""I've found that young cats and elderly ones have an easy time with this flavor. I've always added at least 2 tablespoons of water to the  pate  form of Friskies' food. It certainly doesn't diminish the flavor from what I can tell of the cats' dishes that are licked so clean I sometimes think they look better than when I wash the dishes."""
1;"""I've been using these chews for years now and they truly do what they say they do. I have all my dogs using them except for 2 pomeranians that have allergies. Those are the only 2 that have to have their teeth done yearly at the vet. The others teeth stay white and tartarless!<br />The HEXtra chews seem to work better for my dogs than the regular CET chews"
1;They were just as good as I remembered. I loved the sweet and sour lollipops. I can remember when I was a kid and going to the gas station down the street and getting a few on the weekends with my neighborhood friends. Good stuff love it...
1;These rice crackers are the most delicious pick me up with actual crunch and flavor.  The plain rice crackers are excellent with cheese and whatever dip but these are great plain with lots of taste. (Less calories) TRY THEM!  They will get soft if you don't seal them.
1;"""My dogs love these treats.  My little dogs  ask  for them at least once a day.  My big dogs (outdoor) love these too!  When I give them one I have to watch for my fingers!!!  This is the only treat they get so excited over.  They are always whole ears and I love the resealable bags.  If you haven't tried these for your dogs...I say  go for it! """
1;My dog loved these treats and I would purchase them again for her in the future.  The only problem is my dog would leave small pieces on the floor which isn't a problem with hardwood floors but with carpet could get annoying.
1;Our three dogs love these and in a previous review the price is very good.  I have had a difficult time finding these large bags since our PetSmart in Atlanta stopped carrying them and the cost of a small bag is ridiculous. The added plus is that my order is on auto ship so no need to worry anymore when we are about to run out since we know an order is always on the way.  Thanks for this service Amazon!
1;"""My Poodles loves these snacks. They both can not have protein products but the did so love their pigs ears.<br />I was so pleased when I got a sample of these to try.<br />They love them. Only snack they will sit right down and eat. They love all the flavors"
1;Our two dogs just love this product.  It's an excellent alternative to real pig ears.  We have no complaints whatsoever about this product.  We hope that Amazon.com will continue to sell this product online.  Thanks.
1;"""I have two Beagles and they LOVE these treats. Keep them in a sealed container or they get hard and stale quickly. Your dogs may not mind though. To keep my beagles happy I play a game with them called  Find It . I put them out in the garage and then hide pieces of treats all over the house.<br />Then I open the door"
1;"""I love these Pig ear alternatives... My dogs devour pig ears or these in short fashion! These don't have all of the chemicals and processing of many pig ears. These don't leave greasy mess at the place they ate them...<br /><br />Amazon gives me a discount for subscribing to getting them in regular intervals"
1;"""I've been using Shake 'n Bake for pork for more years than I'd like to remember. The compliments I've gotten are usually in regard to how tender the chops come out (I use boneless chops). One guest told me he'd never had pork chops this tender.<br /><br />If I am going to oven-bake pork chops"
1;It has been a long time since I had used Shake and Bake..I wasn't even sure it still existed.  However I reall enjoyed this sample...it gave a really good flavor to pork steak and I have enough left for several pork shops..very good and healthier than frying. Glad to see it is available at Amazon.
1;I had forgotten all about shake and bake with all the new products on the market. I used it and it left the pork chops tasty and juicy with a crispy coating. I will be using more shake and bake products in the future.
1;"""C'mon - you remember as a kid when Mom would make Shake and Bake pork chops. We probably go through a case of this stuff every year. Still flavorful and adds a  crunch  to your dinners. Pick up a box and enjoy!"""
1;"""Shake 'N Bake Original Pork seasoned coating mix is easy to make. Just follow the simple directions and your pork chops will come out moist. Flavor is great and kids love it. If you are looking for something fast and simple"
1;"""I grew up with Shake n Bake and it still remains a delicious way to bake port chops.  It is easy to prepare your meat in the shaker bag.  The tasty topping seals in juices and prevents you meat from drying out.  If you want an easy way to prepare pork chops with minimal mess and preparation"
1;"""Shake n' Bake is a classic staple that has been around since 1965 (I believe). The idea behind this product is to mimic fried foods without frying.  Simply take the  Shake n' Bake  and put it in a plastic bag"
1;"""Cooking pork chops is so easy when you use Shake 'N Bake. Coat the chops and pop them in the oven. Even a man can do it! Not only that but baking is healthier than frying and cooking on the grill. Also"
1;"""We often pick up boneless pork when it's on sale because it's versatile.<br />Having this coating on hand allows me to toss together a quick dinner that we always enjoy.<br /><br />I often add a little ground sage and black pepper to the coating.  Sometimes a little parmesan cheese.<br />If you're only preparing a small amount and have plenty of leftover coating for another small meal"
1;We have used the pork pouch on porkt chops...and believe it or not...we have used it on chicken.  Both were juicy and had a great flavor.  Easy to use without a lot of mess...you can't go wrong with shake-n-bake.
1;"""Quick review:<br />Rinsed Bone or Boneless pork chops go into a plastic bag or bowl to be coated by the Shake N Bake mix.  Place them onto a baking sheet for the required cooking time and temperature.  When they come out of the oven"
1;"""I ordered this and the Big Train Sugarfree Vanilla Chai Latte to try them since I wanted to save money from buying chai tea latte's at Starbucks or Panera.  At first I didn't think I liked this as much as the Big Train Vanilla Chai"
1;finally found an alternative to getting to Starbucks for a chai!  Individual packets easy to use.  Add milk for a richer taste.  I love this alternate to coffee!  I am now on a regular delivery schedule from Amazon.  Yeah!
1;This is the ONLY Nacho Cheese Dip I will eat! It's not too spicy but it does have a bite - and it's very cheesy. It's so addicting. Problem? Amazon hasn't carried it in over a year! WILL YOU PLEEZE SELL MY CHEESE - I can't find it anywhere!!!
1;I got this for my girlfriend on valentines day. The plant I received looked just like the picture. So did the pot it came in. She has had it for several years now and it is still growing well and healthy. I would definitely recommend it.
1;This is a great product at the most affordable price you can find! I would recommend this kit to all consumers. The source is reliable and the wheatgrass is easy to grow. I am very satisfied with my purchase. Thank you Rejuvenate Forever!
1;"""At first I wasn't sure about wheatgrass juice. It just seemed like a strange thing to drink! Then I tried Rejuvenate Forever's wheatgrass. This product has made me a believer! It is incredibly light and refreshing. People need to try it! Besides for tasting great"
1;I love reading amazon reviews because it can be very insightful at times  and feel compelled to give one. Everything was perfect and really liked the wheatgrass. I would recommend this wheatgrass growing kit to all.
1;"""I really appreciate rejuvenate forever. Everything was so simple and worked out perfectly. I am starting a new chapter in my life and decided to start improving my health with daily shots of wheatgrass. I prefer growing and juicing my own wheatgrass and being independent"
1;"""I am thoroughly satisfied with the wheatgrass. I had no problems with growing the wheatgrass and it turned out to be delicious. I started using this product after being diagnosed with breast cancer and I am trying to stay healthy and enhance my immune system. I can not say for sure if it works but it makes me feel invigorated and I enjoy the routine. I like watching the wheatgrass grow and then consuming fresh juice. Anyway"
1;The wheatgrass  was legite. I needed this product for my cat and it came out perfect. I even tried juicing it and it felt great and I am making another order for my cat and me. Shipment came fast and instructions for growing are easy breezy. I totally reccomend this product.
1;The instructions are so simple to follow. Everything in the description was neatly supplied. The quality is amazing and I was able to grow fantastic wheatgrass.I<br />feel so healthy and happy about the choice I made. I will definitely be<br />ording from Rejuvenate Forever again.
1;I really enjoy this coffee because it's strong but not too strong.  It tastes just right and knowing that it's organic makes it all the better.  I purchase it whenever I am on my last box and I find that it's available on Amazon because they run out of it quite frequently.  Grab it when you can!
1;I bought these K-cups along with the Coffee People Wake Up Call Bold and they were both great.  We bought our Keurig about 6 months ago and I've been searching for something that really tasted good and finally found it.  You can run this twice for a travel size mug and have the coffee be sufficiently bold and not go broke in the process.
1;"""-------------------Update 08/20/2012------------<br />I'm still drinking this same k-cup on a daily basis.  It is still my favorite<br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I got to say that I was initially not a huge fan of the idea of k-cups.  I didn't like the  pod  coffee and I thought it would just be a passing phase.  When I saw Keurig machines and K-Cups"
1;"""I have a problem with getting my coffee strong enough with Keurig makers when using commercial K-cups.  I make 7oz brews with ex. bold K-cups.  Newman's Own Organics Special Blend (Extra Bold) is the first brand I have found that IS strong enough AND tastes/smells good also.  I normally use the aluminum caps to recycle the cups and refill with excellent Viet Namese coffee that I grind as needed. This brand (Trung Ngyuen) can be bought through Amazon. This works well but the cups can only be recycled so many times and you need a source of replacements. Also"
1;"""True to all of the Newmans Own line of products...the K-cup versin of bold decaf did not fail...quality coffee...bold...rich...much better than two other brands of decaf K-cup that I have tried.  This is the closest taste to regular (non-decaf) coffee"
1;I was very glad to see this product offered on Amazon as the flavor is very hard to find in my shopping area and I have never been able to find it in sugar free.  It is one of my husband's favorites and since he is diabetic the sugar free aspect is a big bonus. Product is smooth and creamy and when made with skim milk practically calorie free :)
1;Been buying store bought coffees and even starbucks.  I thought starbucks was it but boy I was wrong!  When Im using this coffee I don't have to put sugar in my coffee which I usually do.  Its so weird but there is no bitter taste.  The freshness of the coffee definitely lasts longer compared to starbucks!Try this and you will never settle for anything less.
1;I was recently at a very nice restaurant for dinner and this was the coffee they served. It was so rich and delicious. We raved about it so much that our server gave us some of the beans to take home. I've been addicted ever since.
1;I began using Illy Expresso Coffee because it was the only expresso that I could find that carried decaffeinated expresso. It is sold in air tight cans that keep the coffee fresh. It has a very good flavor and is finely ground.  A very good product.
1;"""I fell in love with this coffee in a fine SF restaurant and have felt spoiled ever since!  This is THE BEST Decaf coffee you can find anywhere and it does not taste like a decaf at all.  This is full-bodied"
1;"""My husband purchased a tin of the Illy decaf expresso as a treat for Christmas season breakfasts.  In the evening we have also been adding a nip of Bailey's Irish Cream with our after dinner java. Expensive"
1;I'm in love with this drink.  I've turned all my friends onto this and they are not hot chocolate drinkers.  Everyone who comes over goes straight for the white hot chocolate versus coffee.  It is very light and refreshing.  Enjoy!
1;My dog loves these treats! However the # of treats in the box would have been helpful in choosing which item to select for the best value. 32 Large treats in a 5 lb. box. Do the math. This is a great product. Just look for a great price.
1;I have always made my own corn chowder and have been skeptical about store-bought.  BUT!! The Bar Harbor Corn Chowder is VERY TASTY!!<br />My husband (he likes to think of himself as a chowder connoisseur) enjoys it.<br />I use soy milk in it but cow's milk will make it richer.  Add a touch of butter and you're good to go!!
1;"""I first had Popchips last week at a local deli in Miami. I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them. I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand"
1;This chip taste great.  If you're watching your weight you can't beat the calorie count for a bag.  Great low calorie snack food that I have to hide from my 16 year old son because he can eat a case in about three days!
1;"""I eat chips almost every day and decided I wanted to find something that tastes as good but is lighter on unnecessary fat than regular types of chips. I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all"
1;"""I have gained weight *not telling you how much* over the months and am putting myself on a diet. These chips have saved me from gorging on the bad stuff becaue of their taste. This product is not only healthy"
1;"""After reading the reviews I decided to take advantage of the special Amazon was offering.  Wow!  Excellent chip and of course you can enjoy it more knowing it has no cholesterol or saturated fat.  Fortunately the bags are small which helps you control your calorie intake.  But"
1;"""Can't believe they are only 100 calories a bag and pack so much flavor! Tried them in NYC last week and of course can't find them where I live but thanks to Amazon.com I can get them whenever I want and at a great price too! The single bags were selling in NYC for $1.29 to $1.50 a bag. It's a lot cheaper buying the 24 pack here!<br />Looking forward to trying the other flavors"
1;Everyone who tries them ends up eating the entire bag.  We ordered two cases of 12 in bbq and garlic parm and they were gone in two weeks.  Between guests and midnite snacking there are two garlic parms left.  Ordering more today!
1;I am totally addicted to the POPCHIPS!  They are very good and don't taste greasy at all.  One bag has a lot of chips in them and can be filling.  They are only 100 calories and around 3 grams of fat and they don't taste like you are eating something healthy for you.  I love Cheetos and can't have them anymore and now love these chips.  The flavoring is not very strong but strong enough.
1;"""Love these pop-chips.  I've tried some other flavors too but found salt and pepper the best so far.  Original comes a close second for me.  Salt and vinegar is a very close third. Garlic is too strong for me (I love garlic in other forms though).<br /><br />I was hesitant to try these initially because I'm not a big fan of pepper flavor in chips"
1;After my husband tried these chips (BBQ flavor) at a lunch meeting he couldn't stop talking about them.  We found them at a local grocery store - but they were on the expensive side.  Luckily we found them on Amazon at a much more reasonable price.  Thanks for carrying the brand.
1;"""I love Salt & Vinegar chips and once I went on my diet I felt like I had to give them up because it's so hard to find healthy ones.  Then I finally found these and I love them!  They're strong tasting and I actually like them better than regular salt & vinegar chips.  They're less oily and I don't feel sick or guilty after having some.  The one-ounce bags are perfect for a snack"
1;"""These chips are tasty and meet the need I sometimes have for a  treat .  Usually potato chips are off limits due to fat and salt.<br /><br />These fill the need for that  treat .  The individual packages help limit the amount I eat and are very good."""
1;These chips are very good and are only 2 points a serving per Weight Watcher points calculator.  I like the Barbeque Popchips best and having them in a single serve bag prevents me from eating more than a 0.8 ounce serving at one time .  This is my second order of chips and I will be ordering chips again.
1;This is the first time I've tried these and I'll be getting them again. Great substitute for chips while following Weight Watchers - plus they taste good too. Going to be substituting these for my fries w/a hamburger every time. Definitely Buy Again - and Will.
1;"""So my cafe at work switch to a bunch of chips I don't like and some Popchips.  Then they added these sweet potato chips and they're the only ones I buy now.  The sad thing is that these are hard to find at stores.  You'll find plenty of the other Popchip flavors"
1;"""I want to start out by saying that i thought at first that a bag with only 120 calories and 4 grams of fat (no saturated or trans) for every 20 chips was going to taste like crap. I must say that not only was i wrong"
1;I am 15 years old and these chips are the best i have ever had in my entire life so if you're thinking of getting healthier chips for you're kids and or teens these are the way to go my favorite are the seasalt and vinegar but original and bbq are really good too
1;Not quite an ounce...100 calories...great taste and texture...huge fan of BBQ chips but this stands in quite nicely.  Trick will be to stop at one bag. Highly recommend them...as well as Pirates Booty and Vita Tops...trifecta of snacks that go great with my mission to eat healthy.  Now if they could only make a great substitute for peanut M & M's.  Maybe it's better that they don't.
1;My teenage daughter and all of her friends keep eating these. They are really tasty and the chili lime is my personal favorite. It's a good thing that they send a whole case because my daughter says her friends are hooked!
1;These are a great tasting snack. And the size of the bag is perfect for controlling how much you eat. I could eat a lot more than the amount in the bag as they are very tasty. I just wish the price would go back to what I originally paid.
1;These are our favorite chips now. No frying (bad) and No baking (no taste). Certainly the chips are tasty either alone or with Rice dishes. I did not even know they had sweet potato flavor until recently. Will be trying it soon. so many flavors and they were not even in the race few years ago. Health consciousness is definitely viral. Definitely recommend this brand.
1;"""We've re-ordered the original potato Popchips several times since we first tried them.  They are perfect for snackers who crave salty crunchy things more than sweets.  There's only 100 calories per bag and you actually get enough to feel satisfied.  We've tried the sweet potato and jalapeno flavors with less desirable results.  They taste too manufactured to us - the flavor is too intense.  We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.  They would make great crunchy toppings in recipes as opposed to breadcrumbs though I haven't tried anything beyond slipping a few onto my turkey sandwiches.  (Right"
1;Great tasting chips and low on calories too as each bag has just 100cals. I loved the popchips themselves and its a great idea. I dont much care for this chili lime flavor though but i can definitely see myself getting other popchips flavors that i would prefer more.<br /><br />The flavor is evenly balanced out between spicy (chili) and sour (lime). I personally dont like sour chips much but these werent too bad in that sense. The chili is quite spicy though. It worth a try unless you really hate spicy chips or sour chips.
1;These are super tasty treats for days when you want something crunchy and salty.  I didn't find them overly salty as some commented.  They are very good and I would buy them again and again if the price were lower.  I got them as a special (24 single serve bags for $14) and would buy again at that price just to keep around as snacks.  Each bag is 100 cals and you actually feel like you are getting a real bag of potato chips.  Yummy.
1;"""Popchips are delicious!!!  We bought a variety pack.  I love the Salt & Pepper though all flavors are good (according to my husband since I can't have any dairy I did not try those flavors).  While the chips are high in sodium"
1;"""Wow! is an understatement.  These are (by-far) the BEST barbecue potato chips on the market today -- and they don't have any non-food  junk  in them!  These chips taste like a cross between potato chips and barbecue pork rinds but they are low in fat and they are NOT fried!  They are really crunchy and we LOVE the barbecue seasoning that they use on these.  We're sold -- we won't be buying any of those  other  potato chips anymore. I've going to end this review now because I just heard one of my kids open up another bag..."""
1;I am addicted to Popchips - I love the cheddar flavored ones. I don't crave cheetos anymore which I was addicted to.  I know eat a bag of these and my craving is gone. They are actually healthy and for only 100 calories a bag and around 3 grams of fat - it is a much better choice than cheetos. They are very crunchy and full of flavor. I am ordering these again.
1;"""Forget heroin...  Forget cocaine...  Forget meth...  NOTHING is more addictive than these  chips .  Heed these words: these  chips  will cause the downfall all modern civilization.<br /><br />In all seriousness"
1;Popchips are really a great snack and not just an alternative to regular chips but a full on replacement as far as I'm concerned. The taste and texture are great for the Jalapeno ones. I hate greasy fried chips and often switch the baked version of any chips. Now I have another choice...POPPED! If you like flavored chips and you want something crunchy with a great taste then you owe it to your self to try a bag of Potato Popchips!
1;"""I really like these. They are 3 points plus points on Weight Watchers and are much cheaper than the WW branded BBQ chips. My favorite flavor is the salt and pepper.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />They created new flavors and I enjoy most of them. However"
1;These chips are a great treat when you're trying to stay away from conventional fried snacks.  The product arrived in perfect condition and freshness despite the challenges of shipping such a delicate product.
1;"""Saw these chips about 9 months ago and bought the BBQ  at a Giant store in their organic section.<br />These chips are light but tasty and have a good BBQ flavor.<br />Of course they aren't  Herr's or Lays but a good for you substitute. These chips are popped like pop corn. The package explains the process.<br />Trader's Joe's"
1;"""I've tried all the flavors but the Original is by far my favorite.  Ordered these through the Popchips website and it routed me to Amazon.  So delicious and at 100 calories for the snack size bags...I can finally eat chips without the guilt!  No shipping costs so runs right around a dollar a bag.  LOVE THESE!!!<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />Ok"
1;"""I ordered a box of 24 of the variety pack of these after trying a couple of different flavors from my cafeteria at work.  This is a really great alternative to chips and they are really flavorful.  I typically take a sandwich to work everyday and was buying a small bag of pretzels or baked chips in the cafeteria.  I found these and they have the same texture as a chip"
1;"""I love Pop Chips! I've only tried the  regular  ones so far. Enjoy getting them for less from Amazon with a subscription. Everyone I've shared them with has really enjoyed them. If you haven't tried them"
1;I love the BBQ Pop Chips.  They have a little zip to the flavor and are better than most BBQ chips.  The individual bags are great for taking them with you and watching your portion size.  I love the convenience of the auto-ship program.  I never run out.
1;We really like this relatively healthy snack.  We actually use it primarily for our 1yr old son after comparing ingredients and nutrition info with specific for toddler snacks.  Popchips actually compare as well or better than many snacks for toddlers so we went with this.
1;These chips are so flavorful. They taste close to potato chips but they are 100 calories and about 3g fat. Much healthier. They have a great crunch and are nice and salty for when that's what you're looking for. My favorite is the BBQ a few of the others taste a little weird to me.
1;"""I absolutely love Pop Chips.  They give me the crunch and flavor that I want and I don't have to feel guilty when I eat them!  Perfect portion size in the single serve bag.  I have tried 3 of the flavors (original"
1;"""When does 100 calories taste like 240? When one uses these  chips.  Great flavor just the right amount of salt and lots of crunch what could be better<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026KPDG8 >Popchips Cheddar Potato Chips"
1;These chips are wonderful. The BBQ and the Salt and Vinegar are both great. The serving size is very generous and the texture of the chip is great. I got these when they were the Deal of the Day and I'm very surprised at how great they taste!
1;"""I have tried a couple of flavors and the cheddar is by far my favorite.  The Sour Cream/Onion has an off-putting sweet yet salty powder.  These are a little high in sodium and they are not like regular chips"
1;You get a lot of flavor for 100 calories with these Pop Chips. I hesitated ordering them until I heard Jullian Michaels (trainer from the Biggest Loser) mention it as a substitute for potato chips. So glad that I ordered them.
1;These chips are delicious and good for you.  I buy the small bags and they are just right to eat with your lunch or for a snack.  I would recommend them to anyone who loves chips but doesn't like all the fat and calories.
1;"""Popchips are no ordinary chips. What's in them is as good as what's not in them.<br />No preservatives. No artificial flavors. No saturated fat. No gluten ingredients.<br />Popchips are thicker than ordinary chips. They're crunchy "
1;"""I love potato chips and when I go at it I always eat more than I should.  A whole bag of chips can be more than 1000 calories and 80 grams of fat.  Pop chips are a partial solution.  They are very tasty"
1;"""These chips are great for snacking regarless that they are healthy!  They don't taste like health food but they are.  I love the vinegar and sea salt the best.  My only complaint is that the bags are large but the amount of actual product is slim"
1;"""I first tried a small bag of the Barbeque Popchips on a business trip in California.  They were so good I bought several extra bags and brought them home with me for my kids to try (9 and 10 year olds).  They liked them so much"
1;"""I was lucky to have ordered chips on a Virgin America flight and was so excited to see them on Amazon!  They are light and crispy and they do not have MSG or anything bad in them.  They only have about 100 calories per bag and around 3 grams of fat.  I love them!  If you are a chip lover"
1;"""I only had the BBQ flavor since the variety pack was OOS at the time I ordered. This was the first time I ate these and they are much better than I expected. I read the reviews and saw that it got a lot of praises"
1;Can't say enough about these chips.  They are only 3 Weight watchers points and are very satisfying.  Hard to believe they are healthy.  I like the portion control of single serve bags for myself and they are quick to pack in a lunch.  One of these bags is a lot more filling than a small bag of chips and taste even better.  I also bought the 3 ounce bags since my entire family loves these. Try these once and you will be hooked.
1;"""I dislike most  diet  snacks -- like baked  potato chips. But the barbecue pop chips taste as good or better than most non-diet snacks. I did not care for the vinegar and salt & pepper varieties -- and haven't tried the others yet -- but the BBQ chips are great. I make sure I always have these in the house."""
1;Popchip 100 calorie bags are a great snack that help me to control my portions.  I don't trust myself with the full sized bag!  These taste great and have a decent amount in the bags- there enough to satisfy me. They are not bland tasting like some baked chips.  I regularly order these and the BBQ flavor.  I have tried many other Popchip flavors (in the big bags) and these are my personal favorites! I don't know how them make them taste so great for so little calories- but thanks Popchips!
1;"""Great for diabetics who struggle with what to have for healthy snacks!  Ordering online couldn't be any easier or more convenient with very quick/efficient delivery.  The online price is better than in the stores"
1;I have said it once and I will say it again..These are the BEST!!! I am so addicted to this it is not funny. Love the single serving bags and so far the orginal is my favorite..I have friends who love the BBQ ones and Salt & Vinegar but the orginal ones are my favorite:)<br />Thank you popchips!!!!
1;I just tried popchips for the first time and they were great!  I immediately went online to find them and order more.  Only 100 calories in the .8 ounce bag - makes for a great afternoon snack at the office.
1;I really like these. One reviewer mentioned they have soy in them. The last ingredient in them is soy lecithin (emulsifier)which is in many store bought foods. It is not a soy product though. I have to keep my soy intake down because I have Lupus but these do not bother me. They are quite salty and on the rare occasion when I made a pig of myself and ate the whole bag it made my tongue sore. They are really good though. I bought mine at Trader Joe's but am delighted to find them now at Amazon (for only 11 cents more a bag) as it is a pain to go shopping and have to get my wheelchair in and out of the car. I plan to order some right now.A great alternative to greasy regular potato chips.
1;Purchased these by the case since they are so hard to find in my local store.  Also enlisted in the auto delivery program.  The only problem is by purchasing them 12 at a time - they are always in the house and tempting me.  Will never go back to regular chips again.
1;"""I know some have given these a bad review for their taste.  I really like the taste - and most would consider me a picky eater.  I think they taste similar to muncho's without as much salt.  When you need a salty snack"
1;"""I discovered Popchips when I was on a trip to Vegas.  I doubted I could find them when I got home and I was almost right.  I found a couple of stores that had them but only one flavor and the price was exhorbitant.  I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  They are low fat"
1;"""I really love these but hope they would lower the salt or perhaps offer a LOW SODIUM version of them.  I hope the  powers that be  will read this & consider it.  I could eat more of them then.  They taste great and are low in fat which I love."""
1;"""I love eating these chips. They have a nice nostalgic smell that reminded me of my old grandpa's butt when he walked by. Every time I eat these chips I feel like I am taking a whiff of the old codger's rear"
1;This is a tasty low cal snack and the single serve bags are good for those who won't rest until the bag is empty.  If you need to watch your sodium this is not a low sodium food.  The Jalapeno is spicy without burning your tongue and lips.
1;"""I recently discovered Popchips and their greatness. So I have been trying them out flavor by flavor. The Chili Lime has is now my favorite. It had previously been the Salt & Pepper. It is def not too spicy"
1;"""These are absolutely delicious and irresistable. The taste is perfect - not heavy or overdone. It actually kind of sneaks up on you before you realize you've just finished the bag.<br /><br />They seem to melt in your mouth even as you are chewing them as opposed to some brands that make you feel like Mr. Ed (the horse). Yes"
1;"""I didn't realize I was getting 20 packets of these chips but I was happy to see them when they arrived.  I love anything sweet potato so I opened the box eagerly and started chowing down.  They are delicious!  My only concern is that I don't really like the texture of anything  popped  but because the flavor is delicious I can overlook that.  These chips would work perfectly with many diet plans.  They are very crispy and although you won't confuse them with  real  chips they will satisfy that urge for something crunchy.  I'm going to buy them in several other flavors to keep on hand."""
1;These are a much healthy alternative to most chips and they taste great.  They have a great crunch and flavor and don't have that bad after taste that most baked chips have.  My only regret is that I didn't order more when they were on sale there all gone now but even at regular price are worth it.
1;I have three toy fox terriers and they a crazy over the Duck and Sweet Potato Treats. This product is Awesome!!! Your dogs will love them!! Smokehosue products are the best. I buy several different kinds of their Treats for my dogs. The Chicken Breast Strips are another favorite for my dogs. I don't think there is one of Smokehouse Treats that my dogs don't like.
1;"""Most of the coffee houses I have been to use Torani syrup(s). And by coffee houses not the K-Cup or pump dispenser ones.<br /><br />Some Torani flavors are better then others but the Hazelnut is one of my favorites.<br /><br />This is the same high end stuff most coffee houses charge 50-75 cents for.<br />Just using one bottle of syrup will save you a small fortune.<br /><br />Some feel it tastes artificial. Just make sure you are not ordering the Sugar free variant"
1;This product compares great to the taste offered at coffee houses at a greater savings.  I was purchasing smaller bottle at dept. store -- can't compare to the price I purchased for 3 lg. bottles at Amazon.  Great buy and taste!
1;My wife hates coffee...unless we have some of this in the house.  Then I need to arm wrestle for the last cup.  I like it too.  It's easy to order at Amazon and much less expensive than local stores.  This is a really good product at a great price!
1;"""I've been buying this cereal from Amazon for quite a while now but in the 24 oz. size..4 boxes to the carton.  If you're counting pennies this size is the better value.  Little more cumbersome to deal with but worth the savings.  I love the Subscribe and Save.  Don't have to worry about running out or taking the extra time each month to place an order.  Amazon takes the work out of shopping for my favorite cereal and saves me a bundle too.  By the way"
1;I think that Kelloggs Frosted Mini-wheats is absolutely wonderful because it's sweet and because it's filling.  I have it every morning. It is so full of fiber that it makes for a breakfast that will stick with you for a morning free of cravings.  The best part of the 58.8 size of Kellogs Frosted Mini-Wheats is that it has two complete bags of cereal inside.  Love it!
1;"""I don't get how some people say the rawhide does not last? I have a BIG Black Lab who can chew up a store bought 2 foot rawhide in less than an hour. That being said this one has lasted a week now. I am so pleased with this product that this is our 8th purchase of the different styles offered. Our furry baby just loves them. A PLUS to this product"
1;My large dog loves the Chunky Chews - especially this item!  He will chew and chew for hours on end and loves it.  It lasts for several days unlike other rawhide.  I will definitely buy this item again!
1;"""I could not believe how GOOD this ketchup is! It's actually a perfect blend of flavors and my entire family loves it. We had 4 teenage kids for dinner one night and every one of them commented about how good this ketchup was on their french fries and hamburger. They all loved it. I have since tried Heinz ketchup in a restaurant and have found I can't enjoy it. It's too tart/tangy for me... which is amazing since that's all I've ever eaten.<br /><br />Organicville ketchup will be our ketchup of choice for as long as they make it and Amazon.com sells it (of course my local grocer doesn't sell it)! I just wish it was on auto delivery. I would definitely sign up for it! I also bought Annie's Naturals Mustard when I bought this ketchup and the Mustard is EXCELLENT too! Try them"
1;Organicville is simply amazingly delicious ketchup. It is sweetened with agave which is much sweeter than sugar but better for you because of its low-glycemic index. I wanted to buy a 4-pack of Organicville Ketchup from Amazon.com hoping that it would be cheaper. It's not! It's a lot cheaper at my local supermarket!
1;This has to be the best ketchup I have ever tasted!<br /><br />Although it is more expensive that other ketchup brands it does raise the bar for the various brands that we all have been eating for years.<br />This ketchup is thick and taste great for a bottled product that is processed it holds up excellent.<br /><br />I am now a believer in the Organicville brands.
1;"""I bought this ketchup at my local health food store since I've started a  Whole Foods  diet. I was afraid that it wasn't going to taste anything like our beloved Heinz ketchup since a lot of natural/ organic products don't taste as good as the stuff we're used to. Well luckily this tastes the same"
1;They pack a protein punch mid-morning to stave off those cravings and temptations (the chocolate drizzle is SUCH a plus!!) I keep a couple in my bag at work and eat one when someone brings in cake! Satisfying as a breakfast-on-the-go with an OJ. Love that you can get them in packs of 8 here. Sometimes you can find them for $2.50/box on sale but if you go with Subscribe and Save they are about $2.30 a box delivered right to your door!
1;"""I love this product. I do not notice any difference between this product and regular sugar. I consume a lot of sugar and am trying to cut back and I found this product on line. I ordered it and loved it! I am actually very surprised by the price of this product on Amazon.com. You can get the same 2 lbs of domino light (sugar and stevia blend) for $7.98 ea."
1;Finnska licorice is the real deal! It comes from Finland and is better than any licorice you can find anywhere in the world! It uses the purest ingredients and is known as the gold standard among licorice aficionados. Try it- you'll see the difference!
1;THESE MACAROONS ARE BETTER THAN THE NON-VEGAN/RAW ONES! I SWEAR IT!<br />THE BLONDES TOO - THEY TASTE LIKE THEY'RE MADE WITH BUTTER. TRULY A GREAT PRODUCT!<br />BUY PEOPLE AND YOU'LL BE HOOKED (IN A GOOD WAY)
1;"""I eat a 80% paleo diet and these are a GREAT treat for me that fit into my lifestyle eating! I needed to give up my addiction to chocolate bars and the strong chocolate taste in these made it easy! A serving size is 2"
1;"""I LOVE these apple chips!  I started eating the bulk Bare Naked Apple chips.  I loved those!  Then I ran out and came back to Amazon to buy more.  They were out of the bulk so I bought these instead.  A little different apple"
1;We have bought countless boxes of these apple chips.  We love them!  I definitely like the cinnamon ones better than the plain fuji or granny smith apple chips.  They are crisp - not chewy.  And they have just the right amount of sweetness (without having any added sweetener).
1;"""I just ordered my second batch of these apple chips and they are worth every penny!  We absolutely love them and we eat them up in a hurry.  They don't last long in the house.  The package size is a little bigger than I prefer so this time we ordered the smaller sized bags.  We take them to school"
1;"""I admit it's been years since I've had chicken cooked with Shake 'n Bake. I remember my mom using it back when you'd put it in a little plastic bag and shake it. So when I saw this I just had to try it. When my wife saw what we got in the mail(12 pouches 2.05 oz) she laughed"
1;"""Fun to make and the whole thing just tastes great!  It's probably as good if not better than a lot of the Chinese restaurants nearby.  The rice is light and provides a good base for the sauce and chicken.  The sauce is not too sweet"
1;We have a Frenchie with all kinds of skin problems.  At the suggestion of our vet we purchased this food in several flavors.  Our guy decided that duck and potato was the best.  He really enjoys this and we mix it with the dry version of the venison flavor.  And so far so good this spring.  He hasn't had nearly as many skin problems as last year.  Great product!
1;I have been using Newman's products for 5 years now.  I just recently bought this black tea and also a box of the green tea.  I can't say enough about the quality of these teas.  I'm enjoying a cup right now!  Sometimes certain teas can have a bitter after taste to them but this tea is perfect.
1;"""When my supermarket discontinued Newman's Own Organic Black Tea (Royal Tea) I started ordering it from Amazon. I order it a case at a time and it arrives promptly.<br />The tea itself is one of the only organic black teas that come in boxes of 100.<br />Royal Tea is a full bodied black tea. It is a smooth tasting tea. Strong brewed is never bitter.<br />The more you drink"
1;"""I'm English and very fussy about my tea. Not too keen on Tetley (though they do make a decent decaf that my wife drinks in the evening). <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AXZ7Q8 >Tetley British Blend Naturally Decaffeinated Premium Black Tea"
1;"""I try to only consume organic products which led me to this tea. I drink tea daily so I needed it in bulk to save money.  This fits the bill perfectly and tastes great.  I usually use two bags instead of one to get it as strong as I like it"
1;This is a good all around mild black tea.  I trust the Newman's Own Organics label...therefore the price is very good.  I'm often too lazy to use loose tea.  Bags are convenient and don't fall apart.  I make a pot with four everyday for breakfast and later cold.
1;"""It's hard to find a good quality dog treat at the grocery stores and even most pet stores.  Many have added sugars and artificial ingredients as well as harmful chemicals.  But these have nothing but natural ingredients you can recognize"
1;My dog had food allergies until I found Castor & Pollux Ultramix and ALeergy Free Dog Treats.  Castor and Pollux is a great brand and one that my dog loves.  This is a great price for the 1 pound treats.  I was paying more at PETCO than what these cost on Amazon.  You should try these.  I am sure your dog will love them.
1;Looking for a treat whose protein is low (My pets get ample from their Dick Van Patten's Ultra Original) was made in the USA and Organic.<br /><br />The size of the treats are US Quarter in diameter and the thickness of 2 Quarters.
1;I have bought Organix dog food and these treats for several years because they have no chemicals.  My dogs love them.  They also come in various natural flavors.<br />I have one Samoyed and two Poms and the treats are the prefect size for all.  They can be easily broken in small pieces for small dogs.
1;"""This Chorizo is nicely vacuum packed and arrived fresh and delicious. We can only find the super ground wet Chorizo in my area and was very pleased to see Amazon offers this variety. Has mild spicy flavor"
1;I'm not a big frosting person.  I always scrape off the frosting on fancy cakes because frankly its vile.  But this stuff I could eat out of the jar with a spoon.  Duncan Hines Strawberries 'N Cream Frosting is THE BEST frosting I have ever tasted! Its difficult to find in grocery stores which is sad because its so superior. I highly recommend this frosting!
1;"""My dog loves this treat.  She gets two a day.  I dog sit and gave some to a lab I was watching and he loves it also so I gave a bag to the owners and they say when he get it he takes it to his  special spot  to enjoy it.  There's only one other treat that he'll do that with.  Excellent treat!"""
1;"""Except I'm getting oats plus a whole bunch of other grains. If you want an oatmealish(but whole grain instead of cut/rolled/chopped) food that's also got lots of other grains in it this might be something to check out. I usually put it in my rice cooker with a cut up apple"
1;"""I have to purchase lollipops out of pocket for the kids who come through my Immunizations office.  These are perfect and comply with patient safety requirements. Great price for a lot of lollipops.  Will purchase again.  Only a few lollies broken or out of a wrapper and for 200 lollies"
1;"""My dog started to become finicky with her Wellness Core dog food.  She must stay on it for allergy purposes so I really have no option but to encourage her to eat it.  I never in a million years thought I would spend 26 dollars on 2 pounds of dog food but I did.  I do not feed this to my dog by itself.  I crumble up the pieces and mix it in with my dog's food.  Man....does she gobble up her food now.....it is terrific not having to sit with her to get her to eat.  Even the cat picks some of the Ziwi out of her bowl.  : )  I certainly could not afford to feed my dog this food by itself but for those of us that want to give our dogs a treat or that need a supplement to encourage our pets to eat"
1;"""We have a 6 month old Shih Tzu and a 2 year old white fluffy mix.  They weight 8lbs and 15 lbs respectively.  Each eats about 1 scoop a day.  Each 11lb bag lasts us about 1.5 months.<br /><br />Yes - it is not a lot of weight"
1;"""My dog Denali loves the Ziwi Peak food.  It is all meat and we supplement with a little people food and snacks but there is no filler and no byproducts and she eats less volume.<br /><br />It was not available in this area"
1;"""If you had a lot of lamb in your life you'd be impressed with how  lammy  this dog food smells. Our little dog absolutely loves it too. Why wouldn't he?<br /><br />A hidden advantage of using this food is that you don't have to pick up much poo at all. Because this food is nearly twice as concentrated as kibble you'd only be picking up about half as much poo"
1;"""I have three puppy mill rescue Pekingese and I have tried about every other high end dog food that I could think to try.  This is by far the best dog food that I have found to date.  One of my dogs has terrible food allergies and can't eat ANY other foods without getting a bad reaction.  Another one of my dogs previously had very bad tear staining"
1;"""My long coat chihuahua loves this food.  She eats it right down.  I feel good about giving it to her too.  It is a highly nutritious food with no  junk .  My dog is under six pounds of she doesn't require a lot of food.  I suspect this would be a very pricey food to give a large dog though!"""
1;ZiwiPeak is an excellent product.  My ten pound chihuahua suffers from skin allergies so I have tried food products that are grain and chicken free and he loves this product. I recommend it very highly. I ordered this through Amazon and I couldn't be more satisfied.
1;"""I originally purchased this product to serve as my dog's main food since he is allergy-prone with skin issues and a survivor of mast-cell tumor disease.The vet had recommended other  veterinary prescription  kibble(potato/ rabbit) which seemed to really slow down our dog's healing process and worse"
1;I don't think any of my Bakery On Main granola's have ever ended up in my cereal bowl.... I end up eating as a snack instead of as a cereal. I love all the granola flavors and find them a wonderful way to satisfy my cravings for something sweet and crunchy.
1;This granola provides just the right mix of sweetness and flavor. And it packs 9 grams of fiber per serving making this a snack that will keep you full. I would highly recommend this granola to anyone looking for a Gluten Free snack. We love adding it as a topping to yogurt.
1;I have a very different opinion than the first reviewer. I think the Triple Berry Granola is simply great. Its tasty and full of whole grain goodness. It may need more berries though. Sometimes you can get a bag that has no berries in it. Try some for yourself and see if you like it. By the way its full of fiber and is very good for you.
1;"""My dog loves sweet potatoes.  She has sweet potato dog food and her hands down favorite treats ever are duck and sweet potatoes with a close second and third being salmon and sweet potatoes and frozen blueberries.  The breeder encouraged both as well as other great natural foods for my sweetheart of a dog.<br /><br />I am glad that Amazon carries these treats because"
1;"""Everyone is giving these such a great review. I just ordered my first bag for my Scottie to replace the brand that he normally goes crazy over that is stopping making his  duckies . We were up in arms when we got the email from the company that they would not have duck and yam treats anymore.  Charlie has a lot of allergies and duck and sweet potato is one of the few things that the vet said that he could have as a treat (along with his allergy dog food"
1;I've been using this food for my cat ever since he had some UT issues and the vet recommended we switch to a wet food. I looked for a food where the primary ingredients were actually meat or fish. All of Merrick's flavors have meat or fish or poultry (depending on flavor) as the primary ingredient. My cat loves them all! I feed him a half can mixed with water at night and in the morning. His coat is amazing
1;"""This stuff just works great!  I don't usually review things but I couldn't sit by with the clueless reviews.  After a nice lunch sometimes I get a little groggy at work and this wipes it right out. I am also a full-time student. Every semester I get at least one professor that lectures a little to long. I take my little 5 hour energy shot and it helps me to focus"
1;I could not find this soup at my local grocer so was very relieved to find it here in cases.<br /><br />You cannot beat the price because a single can runs over $3.  I am on the Subscriber Savings plan but do not<br /><br />plan to purchase another 12 cans until these are gone so am happy that I was able to lock in a good deal ($29.00)<br /><br />Also try the tomato soup.  Very tasty!
1;I have used this now for 5 years with both of my dogs.  They check out fine every time they go to the vet.  Their coats are shiny and skin is clear.  Activity is fine and overall health is perfect.  I do add fresh carrots and apples each day.  They have bits and pieces while I eat my veggies.  So all I can say is my miniature schnauzers are if peak health and very active.  They like the food but also like the veggies I give them.
1;"""We have used Purina Cat Food for our cats for decades with complete satisfaction. I'm truly amazed and puzzled by the bad results some of the other reviewers have been experiencing.<br /><br />We shifted to the indoor formula several months ago because we do not let our cat outside. We had been giving her the regular Cat Chow but she seemed disposed toward eating the living plants we had in the house so we hoped the indoor formula would help relieve this tendency on her part.<br /><br />Since we shifted over she has seemed to enjoy her food and has exhibited no adverse effects that we have observed"
1;"""Our family has dubbed the Murray River Australian Pink Flake salt  Salt Crack . It is quite delicious and addictive. Love the way the flakes dissolve. it is a perfect finishing salt. We don't use Morton's salt on our table any longer. We give bottles of this salt to friends as presents and it has been a big hit.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P248HS >Artisan Salt Co. Murray River Australian Pink Flake Salt"
1;"""We were looking for a great-tasting healthy chocolate mix sweetened naturally.  This is it!  My diabetic husband likes it (although he says you don't need to use the full recommended amount or it is too sweet).  My kids and I love it"
1;Trying to find a healthy drink that my kids actually like has been difficult but they love Cocoquik.  After researching the ingredients I was happy to learn that they are all natural unlike the artificial sweeteners and preservatives found in most drinks.
1;"""I use this coffee for breakfast.  It goes great with a croissant.  I alternate this with a  Breakfast Blend  coffee for variety.  They have slightly different flavor but the same mildness.  If your the type that prefer a kick-start in the morning"
1;One of my favorite biscuits to have with tea or coffee. Have always used these cookies because they are not overly sweet and not too high is calories. Great product and like the big tin. Make a great gift too.
1;"""I recently purchased these bones for my 4 Cairn Terriers. All my dogs absolutely LOVE them ! Even the 11 year old enjoys chewing them and getting off a  little crunchy bit   . The one review stated that they are a little    messy  . That is true as there are some loose pieces of grizzle  when you open the  plastic wrappr ( that itself is a GREAT feature to be INDIVIDUALLY  wrapped). How I have solved this problem is  that I wash each bone  under running water and then towel dry it before I give to the Cairns . That way there are no loose crumbs. The dogs  enjoy chewing these and it keeps them busy for a long time. When all the the crunchy tendons on the bones are gone "
1;My dog doesn't like big bones. She barely chews them and then they lie around all yucky! These knee bones are a perfect size. She eats them all up. The fact that they're USA bones is a big selling point for me. I would NEVER give my dog foreign bones because I don't know if they are processed correctly to kill bacteria. American dog: American bones!
1;We buy these regularly.  These do not splinter and they do keep the dogs chewing for quite awhile.  We have one little guy who likes to chew a lot.  We keep a couple of these laying around and he is perfectly content to chew on these (new or old) instead of chewing on inappropriate things.  Love them!
1;"""I have given the knee cap bones to my 75 pound chocolate lab and 11 pound miniature dachshund for years. When we added a 5 pound miniature chihuahua to the mix I wondered if she could hold on to her bone with the larger and more savvy dogs in the house. No problem! She is quick and limber and gets to chew whichever bone she wants. She likes to get hold of a bone the older dogs have been chewing on because they have softened it up a bit. Then she chews it for all she's worth. The older dogs are indulgent with her"
1;I have been using Carbquik for over two years and I absolutely love it. I found a recipe for brownies that called for it and the brownies are moist and delicious. I highly recommend this product for those who watch their carbs and want to make their own low-carbs foods.
1;This is truly a wonderful product.  The biscuits are light and delicious.  You can use this product for other dishes as well.  I have made a fruit cobbler and pot pie toppings.  I highly recommend this wonderful product.
1;Carbquik Baking Mix has been a blessing for me.  Having pancakes and waffles again is wonderful after becomeing a diabetic.  I use Walden Farms Pancake Syrup which is wonderful. I have bought this four times and will buy again.
1;"""I prefer flavored coffees and this one and the pumpkin spice are my absolute favorites. The chocolate and raspberry go so well with the coffee that it's like drinking dessert. Love it! And SO glad it's available on subscription. Thanks"
1;This has to be one of my favorite coffees. It's really like eating a chocolate truffle! It's also not an overwhelming chocolate flavor. I don't really like mocha flavors. I gave my mom half of my order and she loves it too! I will definitely order more!
1;"""This is now my new favorite K-cup flavor!  Anytime I see chocolate raspberry truffle flavored coffee beans I buy some since it is sometimes hard to find.  I was sooo excited to see a k-cup with this flavor.  It did not disappoint!  You can definitely smell it when it brews too.  I do add sweetener"
1;"""I've tried so many K-cups. The greatest problem I have with K-cups is many are too weak for me and I've never liked a  strong  cup of coffee. You know the one's that make your grow chest hair. I've tried many flavored K-cups but all are a milder coffee for some reason. However"
1;"""I have been looking for Amazon to start carrying the Van Houtte K cups. I have been spending more just to get these flavors and now I just hope Amazon adds some of them to the subscribe and save program. Creme Brulee tastes just like having a Creme Brulee with a nice cup of coffee. I am impressed with how these k cups taste exactly like the name. This coffee is not over whelmingly sweet and has just a hint of flavor. It is a medium bodied"
1;"""I just love this coffee. It is very complex in tastes. I got a few through a trade and kept putting off ordering it. I would say it is a light/medium roast. I really hate dark chocolate but in this coffee it is amazing. The raspberry and dark chocolate are  true  in taste. I use sugar and cream/creamer and it is like a dessert without the calories. I don't want to be without it in my cupboard. Which is why I wish it were on subscribe and save program here on Amazon (hint)."""
1;"""The only reason I purchased Van Houtte's Creme Brulee was as a gift for my daughter-in-law.  I had tried another flavored coffee by V.H. and wasn't impressed. But with the Creme Brulee they out did themselves.  Not only do my daughter-in-law and I love it"
1;"""When I opened the box the aroma of this coffee permeated the room in a wonderful way. I love the taste of this coffee. Its smooth and flavorful but not overpowering. It reminds me so much of one my all time favorites"
1;"""I ordered this flavor of k-cup from Amazon because it sounded so darn good...and it is!!  The flavors mix and mingle in your mouth when you drink it.  I use cream in my coffee and it doesn't dilute the delightful flavor.  Try it"
1;This flavor is amazing. I'm glad Walmart carries it now. I love how it tastes like a raspberry chocolate truffle in your mouth! Most flavored coffees just smell great this one tastes great. It's my favorite.
1;"""My husband and I enjoy  light  coffee and this is the best light coffee I have had. It doesn't even need to have much sweet added to it. If you are a  light  coffee drinker then this is a good choice to try."""
1;"""I like strong coffee and found that some of the other K Cups were too light tasting.  This is the best one yet.  This is all i drink now.  I like mochas and sweet coffee drinks from Starbucks and Coffee Bean"
1;"""I am a huge fan of  foo foo  (flavored coffee) and this is by far by favorite.  Lots of flavor.  Not only does it taste wonderful...it makes your room smell really good!  I wish it was still offered as an  automatic send ...please bring it back!!"""
1;I almost returned my cuisinart single cup brewer because I couldn't find any flavors as good as the Chocolate Raspberry that I would buy as whole beans from Gloria Jeans - then I found this.  Smells wonderful and tastes great.  My new fav.
1;We were a little leary when we first read the type of coffee this was but decided to try it anyway.  So glad we did!  It is wonderful anytime of day or night.  We do not like strong coffee taste or after taste and this one fits the bill for us.  Enjoy it while you can.  We have been back many times and reordered in fear we will not be able to get it again.  Thanks Amazon.
1;I love my keurig and this is one of my favorite flavors. I can taste and smell the chocolate and raspberry in it. Pair it with a good creamer and you have a lovely cup of coffee. It's just heaven to have my keurig and have differnt flavors!
1;I generally do not drink the flavored coffee but our recent acquisition of the Keurig coffee maker I have been sampling many flavors.  Of all the 15 - 20 flavored coffees I have tried over the past 3 months the Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee is BY FAR the BEST.  Fantastic blend of flavors and it actually has flavor...most others I tried seemed to have aroma but fell short in the flavor category.  I highly recommend trying this flavored coffee!
1;"""Our dog loves this game even with just 1 treat (or piece of food) per section - and will  play  over and over again.  We just have to watch she doesn't try to eat the yellow cups but the blue part is durable.  She easily figured out"
1;It's a great toy and at first she was hesitant but now she is SO fast.. if your dog is treat intrigued this is a perfect gift to buy. Now I need to find something that will keep her busy longer! She wags her tail and is a pro...great brain teaser for any dog!!
1;"""<span class= tiny > Length:: 1:04 Mins<br /><br /></span>Bella my two year old weimaraner really love this toy! everytime i take it out she wags her little tail like crazy. its simple and keeps her busy for the time.  Packaging was great! Perfect for that super active dog.<br /><br />Please see my video review as well!<br /><br />This is a Socialwriteup!"""
1;"""i have to admit - i was worried this was a big mistake when i first gave this toy to Bacon.  he was confused.  he first tried barking maniacally to get the treats to appear.  he then tried digging into the carpet next to the toy.  i wondered if i'd be able to send the toy back"
1;"""<span class= tiny > Length:: 0:34 Mins<br /><br /></span>My dog can get bored easily and when he's bored he's destructive and annoying.  So I try to find anything I can to keep his mind busy and hopefully wear him out.  He figured this toy out fast and gets his food in about 2 minutes"
1;I bought this toy for my 8 month french bulldog a couple of weeks ago and he loves it. I usually set it up for him 2-3 times a week and he is so excited when he sees me getting it ready. At first I was worried that his flat face would prevent him from getting the treats but he has no problem. I would recommend this for anyone that wants to boycott boring toys.
1;The Rover Rescue ball is perfect for all sizes of dogs.  I have 2 3 lb. yorkies and they love this toy.  The little rover inside has a great squeeker.  You put it inside the moon ball and the dogs go crazy to try and get the rover out of the ball.  This toy will keep them entertained for hours.  Also there is no material to rip get torn...the entire thing is a soft rubber and is completely washable.
1;"""I have a Bigon Fri Maltipoo. He is soooo cute and I give him nothing but the best. He is sweet and friendly.<br /><br /> When he saw this product he first ignored it but I turned my back and then he stuck his little paw in the large shape to get the ball. Such a cute lil guy. Also since he is color blind like all dogs of course"
1;Broke right away.... the yellow part broke off and won't fit back on correctly... all the other's I purchased have been great and such a joy watching my lab using her brain to think how to earn each treat.... once the instructional toy is figured out it no longer is a challenge....
1;The toy seems pretty durable which is a big winner for me because usually the toys that I buy for my dogs don't last quite long.  The toy itself has a tennis ball inside which I really like you don't have to buy two separate toys. I also love the fact that it has a ball inside and they can try to entertain themselves. So awesome.
1;"""Im out working in the daytime and feel real bad that my energetic pup is home bored to death! So finding this toy calmed my fear of doggy daytime boredom. It has seven (my favorite number) treat chambers that challenged my dog to lift each cup in order to reveal its prize!<br /><br />It is a must have when teaching the basics of eating obedience/command. It also taught him important problem-solving skills. I had to turn the pieces upside down at first because my dog smelled the treat through the space but cried because he was too inexperienced to figure out how to get it. I suggest this technique if this puzzle is too challenging for your dog"
1;"""This adjustable puzzle toy is a good way to provide a challenging way for your dog to have treats.  It is fun for them if you just put one or two treats inside or many.  The rubber  feet  on the bottom do grip the floor somewhat which makes it more stable when the device is tightened up for extra challenge for your dog.  This is one of what could be many puzzle toys to entertain your dog.  My dog gets excited when I bring out a puzzle toy because he knows that with a little work"
1;Cool product with a great concept.  My dogs love it.  The material on the outside is well made and perfect for chewing.  After fetching the tennis ball the dogs are excited to try to get it out of being hidden in another ball.  Got dirty real quick but very easy to wash.
1;"""My toy poodle is 4 years old and he is pretty smart. He loves learning new tricks and seems to enjoy being challenged mentally. This product is great for him because he loves playing with tennis balls. Basically"
1;This low-carb pasta is not like any other low carb pasta. It is made with semolina and taste better than any dried high carb pasta. Absolutely the best dried pasta I have ever eaten and it is really low carb.
1;"""Loving panko crumbs I purchased these in the container.  I believe they were a case of 12.  These were the best crumbs ever.  Nice and crunching when baking chicken and wonderful in the fry pan as well.<br />Sadly the panko crumbs in the plastic container were  unavailable at this time  when I last checked.<br />These were really the ones ones I can comment on to be excellent."""
1;This product is wonderful.  Being on South Beach I was looking for a whole wheat breadcrumb.  These breadcrumbs are delicious.  They add extra crunch to my chicken and fish.  They arrived in plastic containers to keep them fresh.  I ordered a case and shared with my friends.  Will definitely order again when I run out.
1;My mouth imploded as the first drops entered my digestion systems. My pleasure point rose to where no taste buds have ever simulated. If there was available trucks load of mango pulp the consummation would be rapid. That's why I live in Grand Rapids MI
1;"""We used these candies for a giveaway at a local Strawberry Day festival. They are just the right size and price for this use. Kids and adults loved them! The candy is unique...something you don't see everywhere"
1;"""These belts are so good! I am eating one as I write this review. They are soft and extremely sour (but not too sour). I also like that they come individually wrapped in high-quality plastic. This product comes with 150 pieces and weighs 3lbs 4.90z"
1;I love sour power belts the best. These are great because they are individually wrapped so even in our humid climate they won't stick together and plus is makes it easier to share.... not too much though 
1;Get your hands on a box of these. I've tried all flavors (mostly as a kid) but now stick to strawberry.<br /><br />I remember buying a box a couple of years for the summer. My friends saw and asked (they had never heard of the brand) what it was... I told them to just try one... box was empty in less than a week.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for having this item in stock. Great stuff.
1;"""being a coffee addict for years and being told I had to stop not only drinking caffeine but also I needed a acid free option I found this to be an excellent choice.<br />I drink it like I used to drink regular caffeinated coffee.  Don't get me wrong the caffeine withdrawls were no fun"
1;The coffee came quickly and in perfect condition. Good seller. We mix this coffee with regular coffee to scale back our caffeine intake.All decaf coffee gives my husband a headache. This one doesn't so it seems to be working. And it tastes good with our other coffee.
1;"""Over the past few years I clearly have developed a problem with drinking coffee and indigestion. I tried quite of number of coffees and this one just works for me. Coffee flavor is very good even though I make somewhat thin brew. I find it easy to drink black"
1;"""I wanted ground decaf (Swiss Water Method) which I couldn't find locally except at very expensive prices. I mix it with regular coffee and have  half-caff.  I think it works fine for me and the price is right."""
1;"""My 6-month-old bichon frise puppy takes after his mommy in that he's a very picky eater. This is the only brand of dog food he's eaten without making a fussy face. I'm sold!<br /><br />We had him on Royal Canin for about 2 months until we came across Bil Jac. Originally"
1;"""This Jam is about the best Loganberry I have found in recent years. Loganberry Jam is very hard to find in retail stores. I'm told that the berries are no longer as commercially viable as other berries..something about the berries ripening at different times.  Pioneer Valley Loganberry Jam has a fresh"
1;Chef Morito's is a GREAT Addition to the Puerto Rican / Carribbian Island Seasonings.<br />It adds great flavor to all the dishes that you create with the seasoning.<br />I would highly recommend this seasoning to anyone and including all of my friends and family.<br /><br />I have learned about this seasoning from my sister that also uses it.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB0LFO/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
1;My nephew turned us on to this seasoning when we visited him in Michigan.  We are from Calif and love our Mexican Food.  This seasoning was the REAL thing and now we're keeping it on the shelf as a staple seasoning.  Love it!
1;"""I have used Sweet  N Low Liquid Sweetener for years.  My parents used it in their coffee.  The liquid dissolves quickly with even having to stir in either hot or cold beverages and does not leave an after-taste.  It only takes a few drops to sweeten my English tea."""
1;"""My 11 dogs love this so I say it is great! The tiny ones (toy poodles) get the almost straight food. The others get this mixed with their Bil-Jac. I am impressed with the ingredients. Not full of corn! Another thing I noticed... Every time I have fed my dogs any brand of straight canned dog food"
1;"""My 11 dogs love this so I say it is great!  The tiny ones (toy poodles) get the almost straight food. The others  get this mixed with their Bil-Jac. I am impressed with the ingredients.  Not full of corn! Another thing I noticed...  Every time I have fed my dogs  any brand of straight canned dog food"
1;It is a great product.  Our standard poodle has a problem with keeping weight on even though he is a ravinous eater.  He put 5lbs on and looks great.  We add the canned dog food to his dry with a little water. Also never a problem with shipping or packaging.
1;I bought this food after searching through many websites to find the right nutrition for our 3 dogs.  We decided to give it a try and our Collie/Lab was hesitant b/c of all the junk her previous owners had fed her.  The Yorkies and even the cat immediately jumped in to chow down.  Our Collie/Lab has now decided this food is great and we even purchased the dry food to go along with it.  I was very happy to see this food rated 4.5 out of 5 stars in a food guide at our local boutique pet store.<br /><br />This will be our primary dog food for a long time.
1;This the second time I have ordered this product from Amazon and have been happy with the service received.  I enjoy the cocoa very much.  Drinking a cup of cocoa at bedtime has become a nightly ritual.  I highly recommend this cocoa.
1;Droste cocoa is simply the best chocolate for baking. It is dark and rich and makes the best chocolate cake. Other chocolate cocoa does not taste as good.  The flavor and the color is much better with Droste.  Other cocoa's have a chalky taste in my opinion.  I would not use anything else.
1;"""I have been using this product in my protein drinks for over 4 years or more.  It is better tasting than any other I have tried.  I could make due with the giredelli baking chocolate but it's not the same.  This product has been harder & harder to find lately & I have to stock up when I find it.  I am unsure as to why it is more difficult to find except maybe it doesn't sell as well due to the price.  However"
1;"""I love the flavor and consistancy--and they are real Potatoes.<br /><br />These packets are perfect for a large appetite or a small family. They taste great with my meals. I usually put half in the fridge overnight and they still taste yummy the next day.<br /><br />I like mashed potatoes with just about anything--but these Betty Crocker reds "
1;This is my first time trying BC mashed potatoes.  They are very good.  It gives you a choice of making them with just water or milk and water. To me they tasted  more like homemade with just water with butter added. Good to have on hand for quick and easy.
1;I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH OF HOW GOOD THESE ARE FOR AN INSTANT FOOD.  I WISH MY IGA CARRIED THIS PRODUCT.  PERFECT SIZE PACKAGE FOR 1-2 PEOPLE.  1C WATER AND 1/2C MILK PER PACKAGE.  EASY TO MAKE AND JUST AS EASY TO EAT----EVEN WITHOUT GRAVY.  WILL PURCHASE AGAIN.
1;"""These are so tasty that they don't last long.  I have got to say that this product is great (I make trail mix with it) but all products I have ordered from Bergin have been top notch.  That includes all nuts"
1;"""Kraft Mayo with Olive Oil and Cracked Pepper takes a little getting used to. It is a  lite  mayo so it has that slight difference from regular mayonnaise. It is not quite as rich and has more of a lemon flavor. The cracked pepper is prominent in the mayo. I can see why some reviewers were put off. Only order this if you are used to a heavy black pepper dose on your food. That said"
1;I received a sample of this through House Party and my husband absolutely loved it.  He has been looking for it ever since and they don't sell it local so I am thrilled to find it here on Amazon.  Not sure what the reviewer who commented on it being hot was talking about.  It has pepper but I wouldn't say it was over hot and since I have gastritis I am extremely sensitive to hot spices and this was just fine.  I'd recommend this product.
1;"""I think it is great. Best surprise I ever bought. I could eat it right out of the jar.I mostly eat it alone on 100%Whole Wheat bread.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ECVRNO >Kraft Mayo with Olive Oil and Cracked Pepper"
1;This is really good tuna! I like tuna & I like lemon pepper flavor. In this product they are both together. I eat tuna 2-3 times a week & most often with lemon pepper seasoning added if I can't find this. It is really good on buttered toast right from the can. I am always buying it because I love it. This.tuna has the best flavor out there of the others I have tried.
1;This is the only mint breath freshener that my nine year old daughter will eat and not only does she like them she absolutely loves them!  It's a special treat in the car and much better than an artificial/chemical containing candy.  I highly recommend that people with younger kids give them a try.  These are also perfect for anyone wanting a mint that is not as strong as Altoids.
1;"""Newman's Own Organic Mints in Wintergreen are my all time favorite mints EVER! I was a frequent Trident bubble gum chewer up until I found out that it contained Aspartame and was on a rabbit hole chase ever since to find a gum replacement that could hold the taste (minus Aspartame)and not harden after a minute. I still have not found one but then I tried Newman's Own several months ago and now it is my all time favorite product. It tastes refreshing"
1;I was so shocked to find out that almost all gums have BHT.  I went to the health food store and got gum with Xylitol but I didn't like the taste.  B Fresh was the only one with Xylitol that didn't taste like aspartame.  I saw Newmans Own Organic Mints and was happy to see no aspartame or BHT and they are really good.  I hope the company starts making gum.  The only problem is the mints are made in Mexico.  What is the matter Americans can't make mints?
1;These mints come in a beautiful tin and are fresh-tasting wintergreen.  Try wintergreen over peppermints or spearmints and you will never go back!  Organic too from a reputable supplier (Newman's Own).  These are a regular in our household.
1;"""I like this candy very much and purchase it on a regular basis to keep in the candy dish on my desk.  It is well like by everyone.  Some people return to my office for a  visit  just to take a few.  Thank you."""
1;My family loves Chicken Carbonara.  It is hard to find a package mix that tastes good and that the local grocery store stocks.  We love Wagner's Carbonara.  Now we know where to find it when we need it.  Bought 24 of them so we should be good for a little while.
1;"""I have one of these first thing in the morning while I get ready (so as to not keep my metabolism waiting before a morning kick-start) and might have another one in the afternoon as a snack. They tastes good and I like that fact that no sugar is added. Just like apples would"
1;This is a product that we use daily in my house.  I thought I'd check Amazon to see if I could buy it in bulk.  I was very happy to find it available.  I decided to give it try.  I had it delivered to my front door in no time.  I didn't have to lug it anywhere and the package was in perfect condition.  I didn't have to pay for delivery because I am a Prime member. I will always buy it this way now and always look for other items that are staples in our home on Amazon Prime first now.
1;This is the only catnip our cat will have anything to do with and she LOVES Cosmic Catnip.  It's been a little difficult to find in the stores here but Amazon always has it for sale online.  The packing was great and shipped very quickly.  I would recommend this to everyone who has a cat.
1;"""My cats have gotten so used to this Cosmic Catnip that they won't be impressed by any other!  People have given me other catnip and they basically turn up their noses at it after using Cosmic Catnip.  This stuff is the BEST!!  If you keep it tightly closed"
1;Works amazingly. My friends and I volunteered and donated cat toys for a local animal shelter. We put stuffing and cosmic catnip in socks. The cats loved to play with it. The smell is not horrible like some catnip either.
1;Purchasing Cosmic Catnip in the 4-ounce jar is a great investment in your cats'enjoyment.<br />It is so potent that my kitties were meowing and scratching at the cardboard shipping container which contained the (sealed) jar !<br />It's a very generous portion for the price.<br />A big thumbs up for Cosmic Catnip !
1;"""Every year I buy a container of Cosmic Catnip to make a few  tube-sock  type toys with for my cats (currently 8 and 9 years- Female and male respectively) for Christmas. Even with the toy downstairs and wrapped in some thick wrapping paper"
1;"""We have bought Baklawa from Shatila many times from their Dearborn store as well as sent it to friends via mail order. It is simply outstanding Baklawa -- perhaps best anywhere. You wouldn't like baklawa from Costco or other places after having baklawa from Shatila.<br /><br />At their store"
1;This is a badass dressing and you'd be hard pressed to find another dressing that tastes so good and has no calories or sugar.We love this on salads and we love to put this on our hamburgers to make some big mac copies.Give it a try you want be sorry.
1;"""Sometimes these products taste funny and leave an after taste in your mouth so you can't eat anything else till that goes away.. But this is the best I've every tasted and no after taste I swear I eat two bags a a time!!!<br /> There great try them even if you tried a different one and it wasn't good this one makes up for the other ones"
1;I bought two strips of this before I went backpacking. While on the trail I decided to break out my snack not knowing what to expect. This stuff is awesome! I shared with my sister who is not a vegan and she liked it too! Great protein boost! Great flavor! Great texture!
1;"""My daughter wanted to try these because she used to love jerky type snacks prior to becoming vegetarian. I have tried other brands of veggie snacks similar to these so I did not have high expectations. I was pleasantly surprised! These are yummy! Great texture & flavor. Great ingredients too! We will be stocking up on these as a healthy"
1;"""These jerky strips are delicious!  I've been a vegetarian for 13 years and I'm always looking for tasty vegetarian  meat replacement  foods.  These strips definitely work for me. I keep a couple in my car to snack on when I don't have time to stop and eat.  The texture is so  meat-like  you will question yourself and re-read the ingredients to be sure is isn't made from animal flesh. I bought a case of the Texas BBQ and a case of the Hickory Smoked.  They are both fantastic"
1;This is a great tasting product.  The texture is just tough enough.  Great to have on hand for a quick pick-me-up.  It's a bit peppery so it does have a little kick to it if you hit a peppercorn.<br />Highly reccommended.  I love it.  Just bought myself a pack of 24.
1;"""I cannot give high enough praise for these incredibly delicious and protein packed little snacks. Even my very food fussy 5 year old likes them. They are the perfect light lunch or snack to throw in your purse for a busy afternoon. The flavour is delicious"
1;"""This is just simply delicious! I have so far tried the Texas BBQ and the Mesquite Lime and I can't describe how tasty it is! I've never had real beef jerky before so the only way I could see someone giving this a bad review"
1;I loved this!  I am a vegetarian and a mom that loves to have something in her purse for weak moments!  This totally fits the bill.  I looked on the Primal Spirit website before ordering to see the differences in nutritional content between all of the flavors and I was surprised that there was quite a difference.  I ended up choosing the Texas Barbecue because it equaled 2 Weight Watchers points and was the lowest in calories.  They are definitely pricey but in my mind totally worth it.  A lot come in a box and they are a great snack to carry with you!
1;"""Have tried most of the flavors and can't say anything bad about any I've tasted. The Teriyaki and Hickory Smoked are my personal favorites. For 99 calories you get 11 Gms. of protein and great taste. Add an apple and/or salad and you've got a full"
1;I bought my first Primal Strips seitan jerky at the gym after a workout one day and since then I've been hooked. The mesquite lime is my favorite flavor. Super yummy and only 74 calories. It's a great non-soy protein-filled meatless snack. Plus it's totally portable so you can keep one in your desk drawer or your handbag for when you're stuck for a snack.
1;Hi! I could eat a box of this vegan jerky at one sitting. Delicious! The hickory smoke flavor is mildly hot without burning. There's to be a hint of maple syrup or similar tasting spice in the flavor. Texture seems right. Chewy but soft enough. The strips came in an outer paper box. Easy enough to open. The individual wrappings are easy to open with scissors. Tougher to open by hand. Individual wrapping has a cut at top for peeling open. I had no luck that way. For taking these on a hike it's a good idea to bring scissors. I recommend this jerky for a great snacking experience. I hope to buy other flavors in future orders.
1;"""Bought one stick of this at a health food store and loved it!  I often crave a jerky like food.  This completely satisfied my craving.  The health food store was selling them for 2bucks each so it was a no brainer to just order a box.  I got the hickory smoked.<br /><br />I have also tried the Teriyaki flavor"
1;I ordered a box of the Mesquite Lime after finding the Texas BBQ at my local organic grocery store. I love both flavors but am glad I got a bulk of the lime. It's delicious! I love that its only 75 calories and yet so high in protein. It's hard for me (as a vegetarian) to get enough protein while still keeping my carbs low. The standard protein bar usually has way too much sugar for my liking. These are a great afternoon snack and perfect after an intense workout.
1;I am vegan and just came across this product not too long ago. It is the BEST snack. I've tried different flavors and I tend to like the Texas BBQ ones the best. The texture is just like meat and its healthier for you.
1;"""I just wanted to say that I picked up my first single serving of Primal Spirit Texas BBQ Meatless Vegan Jerky today at my local Home Economist while searching for Gluten Free products (I'm new at this so its an adventure everytime I go into the store!).<br /><br />Now"
1;"""<span class= tiny > Length:: 0:32 Mins<br /><br /></span>We threw an office party with <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00331Y536 >25 Pre Packs of Dippin' Dots Ice Cream</a> and it was such a hit we wanted to share what was in the box!"""
1;"""I purchased this product at a health food store about 2 years ago and I've been buying it ever since. I've recently moved and the health food store is too far away so I decided to buy it off the internet. At the time"
1;When I opened the package a wonderful aroma was greeting me! This was the first time I experimented with Szechuan Peppercorns. They are not really peppercorns but husks. You have to dry roast them for a few minutes then grind them. I used them in a oil based marinade for my chicken dish...very yummy and pleasantly unusual. Delivery was fast and the peppercorns appear to be super fresh.
1;"""Sichuan peppercorns are magical. If you've been to a good Sichuan restaurant you'll hopefully have at least one dish that has the great flavor of Sichuan peppercorns along with the strange and wonderful tongue numbing sensation. If you're interested in making great Sichuan style Chinese food at home"
1;"""THE BEST SALT ALTERNATIVE EVER...When Bensons Table Tasty appeared on Amazon I had to quickly write a review.  I LOVE Bensons Table Tasty. I have been using Table Tasty for years and can't be without it. Bensons Table Tasty gives my Vegan taste buds a  TREAT  everytime I use it.  I am never without it.  I eat 90% raw foods an 10% heated (no processed) and eat only organic whole foods"
1;My mother is restricted to a low sodium and potassium diet.  This seasoning does has a salty flavor and has added some quality taste to such a bland diet.  Eating eggs and other certain foods without salt is not palatable.  I tried this seasoning and was pleased with the salty flavor.  She really enjoys it and we take it with us when she is in the hospital to season her meals.  We will probably buy the pound bag next time.  Five Stars for this product.
1;I used to eat the kamut puffs cereal plain and dry before I tried this product.  The plain kamut cakes are crispy and taste great.  I shared with friends and they liked it too.  I will definitely order more.
1;"""I'm a big fan of gourmet sodas and San Pellegrino makes some of the best damn juice sodas in the world. I've had the <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YVQ47Y >San Pellegrino Aranciata</a> and the <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FR0B6 >San Pellegrino Limonata</a> many times"
1;"""I love fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Most grapefruit drinks just don't taste like the real thing. I saw a 6-pack of San Pellegrino Pompelmo at the local Fresh Market and thought I'd give it a try. After having several cans"
1;Just tried this and love it! Perfect refreshing soda on its own. However my sister added this to a glass of cabernet that I had and it tasted like a wonderful sangria! I am going to snap these up and keep on hand to add to red wine for those that don't love the taste of red wine by itself. Add a little fruit and voila...sangria.
1;"""We have had this less than a week so I can't comment on the durability.  We use it for my husband's hazelnut syrup that he can't live without:  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J83OQE >MONIN ORGANIC HAZELNUT"
1;I used these chocolates for a party favor and they were fabulous.  I got a lot of compliments.  They were small but tasty.  The shipment arrived quickly with no melted chocolate.  It was a good purchase
1;I have friends addicted to these now which is fine since the 5lb bag is plenty enough for lots of sharing.<br />I was gifted these and the sender mentioned that she had found them on Amazon.  I was used to buying them by the 1/4 or 1/2 lb at a candy shop near where I used to work. To me they are more like a traditional gumdrop in texture and with the sugar crystal coating but the flavor is sweet and tart just like pink grapefruit without the slight bitterness that the white grapefruit tends to have.  Glad I found these here!
1;"""This candy was purchased for a wedding for display and consuming.<br /><br />We had to hold onto it for 4 weeks before the event and I'll just say... no one in the house ate just one.<br /><br />Tasty"
1;"""We ordered this candy for the color without tasting it for my daughter's wedding reception candy bar.  It was among the favorites.  It is not too sweet and not too tart--just right.  Due to huge popularity in my office"
1;"""I love this Hot Cocoa.  It is the same that our local Bob Evans serves.  I used a single serve package of another brand just to see how much I should mix of the Bakers.  What I didn't expect to see was just how smooth the Bakers mix was compared to the  other brand .  And after my first cup at home"
1;I totally concur with Terrie's review. Fell in love with the hot chocolate at Bob Evan's and this is what they serve. I left my other hot chocolate out for my co-workers. Good riddence. This is so smooth I no longer need to add coffee creamer to doctor it.
1;Freeze dried sweet corn is so delicious!  I first found it easily in the local markets.  Now it's no where to be found locally and I don't know why no one is carrying this delicious item?!<br />So it's online purchasing and I found it on Amazon.com.  Harmony House Foods offered one of the better prices for the value.  It arrived in a timely manner and it's delicious.
1;"""I have used this product consistently to make my mincemeat pies at Thanksgiving and at Christmas for more than 40 years. And I am not the only person who has despaired because of the inability to find this product. This product availability problem began at least 6 or 7 years ago. Then"
1;"""I love Mince pie made with Nonesuch brand mincemeat but it has to be the condensed kind. This year mur local stores did not carry the condensed packaged type and I do not like the jars as I find them too soupy.<br />I went on line and found I could purchase it that way. I ordered it"
1;"""Pocket coffee's are delicious!  Just make sure you put the whole thing in your mouth before biting down!  The center squirts into your mouth and you get to enjoy both the espresso center and chocolate in one fantastic bite!  They make a great gift for non-coffee drinkers too!  I don't drink coffee"
1;"""I hardly dared hope that this would be the product I remembered from childhood.  I was amazed to find that the taste and consistency were everything I could have wanted.  It's exactly the same!  I haven't enjoyed anything so much in years.  Apart from the nostalgia factor"
1;I purchased this for some family members that only like instant coffee. They have really enjoyed this and I tried it and found out it has a great taste. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a great cup of coffee without having to make a full pot when they only want a cup.
1;"""My issue with instant coffees has always been that they are good when you first open the jar but in a couple of days the crystals acquire other tastes (stale).<br /><br />Not an issue anymore with these individual packets. Fresh to open every time. I find them a much better value than Via and they are pure old-time coffee (who knows what Starbucks is putting in their grounds).<br /><br />This product has also solved one of my longstanding issues with General Foods International Coffees: not enough coffee flavor. Those little cans were $4.00 and it took half the can to get anything like a coffee flavor with the sugars -- Cafe Vienna is my favourite.<br /><br />Now"
1;We keep some of these in our RV and in our suitcases.  Easy to use wherever a cup and hot water are available.  Very good flavor for an instant coffee.  The individual packets stay fresh a lot longer than small jars or bags of instant coffee.
1;"""My sister lives in NJ and raves about this product.  She has it as a breakfast sandwich all the time.  I knew absolutely nothing about it and found out it's a local product in NJ from a NJ manufacturer.  The company that sells it online(LIL-BIGSHOTS) gets my rave review.  It was hot hot hot out"
1;"""This is not an instant tea mix.  This actually powdered green tea leaves. Hence the cloudiness.  This product is convenient to mix into my water bottle that I take to the gym.  The finest green tea from an antioxidant perspective is Matcha green tea. It's the tea used in scientific studies that touts green tea's antioxidant properties.  It's very expensive but is grown in special areas in japan.<br /><br />I feel this is the next best thing.  It dissolves easily and I can take it with me and add to water on the go. I use match a when I'm at home"
1;"""It's a different kind of Green Tea that one might have to an acquire a taste for. I loved it the moment I tired it. There's a pureness to Yamamotoyama unlike any other ice tea that I've tired. When drinking it"
1;"""I found a box of this stuff at a store while on vacation. Thought that it would be interesting to try since it was powdered and didn't require any brewing. Simply pour into a glass and add water. Could it really be that good if so simple?<br /><br />A resounding YES. I was very surprised. I've been drinking green tea for awhile"
1;This K-cup holder is very sturdy. It adds a bit of coffee house atmosphere to my kitchen. It holds just enough k-cups to allow a variety to choose from. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a k-cup holder to add art and function to their kitchen.
1;I received the Molasses before the expected due date.  The unsulfured blackstrap molasses was the only ingredient (no preservatives) on the label.  It is an excelent product for brown sugar creation or baking.  I also mix a teaspoon with a glass of water for the mineral suppliments.
1;""".<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016N8I0Y >1980's Newsprint Retro Candy Gift Box</a><br />Awesome way to celebrate the decade your loved one was born. Great for someone who is nostalgic for they're childhood years."""
1;"""I have really enjoyed using this coconut sugar.  I used it when baking oatmeal chocolate chip cookies and the flavor and texture were great.  I've tried substituting agave in cookies and the texture suffers so I am pleased to have a healthier sugar alternative.  I cannot (and more importantly"
1;"""I had never heard of coconut sugar and expected an overly sweet taste. I was pleasantly surprised by the natural sweetness of this sugar. It was not powdery and over sweet like most sugar alternatives. I enjoy baking with my kids and I feel slightly less guilty using this sweetener. It is easy to substitute 1:1 for regular sugar. I started using a teaspoon or two in our breakfast smoothies (which are made with unsweetened protein powder"
1;"""I just started using coconut sugar as a substitute for regular sugar in my cookies and sweet bread. I love the caramelized flavor. I also sprinkle it on my lattes and oat meal...sooo yummy. Now I don't feel bad that my kids want to add  sugar  to their cereals and fruit since coconut sugar has naturally occurring vitamins and minerals. Love this new product!!!"""
1;"""This sugar is simply wonderful! Wonderful for you and tastes wonderful! I use it in my coffee and I bake with it. Everything I've baked so far turned out pretty delicious. I love this new alternative from cane sugar. The texture and the taste are different"
1;I use this in both my coffee and my tea now in place of refined sugar after seeing it on the Dr Oz show. It tastes great and doesn't mess with my blood sugar. I plan to try the cookie recipe posted here on Amazon at Christmas time. It is pricier than sugar but it's money well spent to me. I've tried every kind of sugar substitute out there on the market and I found they all left an aftertaste I didn't like. Not so with the coconut sugar. Delicious!
1;"""I love this sugar.  It is the only sweetener that I use now.  I bought my first case a few months ago and am getting ready to order the 2nd one.  For me... a little goes a long way as I don't care for anything overly sweet.  I use the same amount of this product that I used with the organic sugar I've now replaced.  For Lucy who is wondering whether this is 100% organic coconut sugar"
1;Im just about finished with my first bag of this sugar. It is very easy to cook with. Yesterday I used it with organic butter and made a caramel to put over organic stove-topped popcorn. It came out perfectly and was delicious! Im thankful to have a healthier choice for those kind of special treats.
1;"""I bought this because it was on sale and I was curious. It's made from the nectar of coconut flowers. It has this incredibly amazing flavor that is like sugar and coffee and caramel and chocolate and butter and maple and salt and cinammon and rich gooey goodness dripping through my mouth. One of the most delicious things I have ever tasted"
1;Had my first southwestern margarita a few months back at a restaurant and just had to recreate them at home. Had a good time fine tuning the recipe. Even the errors were delicious.The product shipped quickly and in fine shape.
1;My dogs love these bones.  I bought all sizes.  My jack russel loves the big ones and the small ones.  My 60 pound mutt loves the big ones. They are great.  They are able to digest them and able to enjoy the bones.  I bought so many of them.  Petsmart for some reason discontinued them I was so upset.  I was so happy to see them on Amazon for a great price. I highly recommend them.
1;Our Siberian Husky is overweight and on a diet.  She also is great at building placque and tartar on her teeth - baad breath! She has a touchy stomach on top of it all.  Tried these bones in all flavors and she loves them.  They help with her teeth and breath.  She gets one bone for her lunch (she's a 3 meals a day gal).  Her other meals are now canned green beans with either yogurt (plain) or low fat cottage cheese.  She has lost about 11 lbs and is doing great!  No more throwing up her food!
1;We have a dog with a liver shunt - so she can't have a lot of protein / can't digest protein.  Booda Bones are the BEST treat for her (and our other dog loves them as well!).  The only 'downside' whatsoever is that they're a tad expensive - but they're worth it!
1;I hear these beans have great health giving properties so I am still experimenting with recipes for them. They are easy to eat but do require a certain amount of preparation and planning when incorporating them into a regular diet.
1;"""Let me start off with some info about myself.<br />A few weeks ago after my son's birthday I looked at myself and decided I needed to lose weight. Since then Ive lost 14 lbs so far.<br />In addition to my work-outs and my protein shakes I love this meal.<br />I have the Tasty Bit Jodhpur Lentils for dinner when im at work.<br />I unlike alot of reviewers enjoy the soupy texture. I add my homemade dried habenero powder to it"
1;"""This tastes like classic 'restaurant' dal and has great flavor. Dal is often a little soupy and not too thick like westerners might be used to when making lentils. If you want to add dal to your meal that tastes like the old fashioned Indian restaurant dal"
1;I've tried many of the various types of buffalo bills jerky and this is my favorite.  I'm definitely a fan of the country cut and this actually has a little kick to it.  I enjoy spicy food so for those that prefer mild this is probably not for you.<br /><br />I'll definitely be buying more of this.
1;"""This is our second order from this company and our family loves the Huckleberry Jam. The jam is so delicious and has real huckleberries (of course) in the jam. It is very high quality and my Mom's new favorite jam over anything else. I highly recommend purchasing from this company and if you are looking for a great jam to try"
1;"""These are so pretty and the subtle plum flavor coupled with the toasty nuttiness of the sesame seeds gives the culinary curiosity seeker some taste-bud adventure as well as a unique visual display.<br /><br />This year [2011] I plan on making a non-traditional Christmas dinner with 5 different kinds of Sushi and I can't wait to use these for my Sushi. I'm going to buy the green Wasabi sesame seeds by Roland next month so that I can do a cute red and green inside-out Sushi. Maybe I'll even take a picture and upload it to Amazon.com if it turns out well.<br /><br />The bottles are convenient in size and I like the little twist-off lids for shaking the seeds on your choice of food. I like to shake some of these on my stir-fries and soups after plating. If you stir these into something during cooking"
1;We used the mints for a candy bar at my daughter's wedding.  They were wonderful!  They tasted good and everyone loved them.  I wish I could have purchased a second box but they were gone.  I'd definitely do that again.  They were perfect for the wedding!
1;"""I made  from scratch  Almond cupcakes from a recipe in a well known cupcake book (Hello Cupcake) and inadvertently used twice as much almond paste as the recipe called for. I frosted them with almond frosting and topped them with coconut. I have had more compliments on these cupcakes than even I could imagine! People LOVED the taste and everyone wanted to know how I made them. Great product. I love using almond in lots of baking and this worked great!"""
1;"""This product was recommened to us from a friend.  After doing some research I found out that it was one of the best ceral's out there and recommended by Dr. Sears.  After buying some at a local store and trying it my baby LOVVVED it!  I could not fee him fast enough! The pre & probiotics really help him not get  backed  up.  I also save so much with the subscribe and save.  Thanks amazon and thank you happy bellies!!"""
1;"""I have purchased and tried all Happy Baby products and have liked them all (or at least my children have liked them all).  I really enjoy reading peoples' product reviews to see what they think of the products that I am thinking of buying.  I have to say I was a bit concerned about the number of negative reviews that were posted on the oatmeal cereal.  I bought it many years ago for my oldest child when she was a baby and we loved it"
1;We've gone through 5 cans now and my daughter loves this stuff.  I still went ahead and purchased this and the happybellies rice cereal after reading some great and not so great reviews for the Happybellies products and unlike some of the reviewers I've had none of the funky smell/gray discoloring.  I'm assuming they fixed the problems. We mix it with fruit or feed it to our daughter just mixed with breastmilk.
1;"""I absolutely love this cereal.  Smells soooo good!  Almost has a banana-y smell to it in my opinion.  I mix it into whatever food my son is eating just for some added health benefits. I also really like the packaging.  A canister is so much better than a non-sealable box like another organic brand (and non-organic brands) comes in.  I've tried the rice and multi-grain cereals too but prefer the consistency of the oatmeal better than the multi-grain (which is a good cereal too but was more flakey and  soft .  Will continue to buy this product for some time."""
1;"""My son loves this cereal!  The quality has been consistently good (we've had none of the problems with  gray  and  rancid  cereal that other reviewers have noted) and even I like the taste.  Highly recommend."""
1;I really wanted to find a rice cereal that had more nutritional value than just plain white rice and I am so happy I found this product. I started my baby on this at 5 months and he loves it. I mix it with Breast Milk and once he starts veggies and fruit I will add that in as well. This does not constipate him either and I love that it is Organic and enriched with Probiotcs and DHA.<br />If you are looking for a great first food for your baby with quality ingredients this is it and you can't beat the price for organic.
1;"""We love this oatmeal! The texture is very smooth and my baby loves the taste. We didn't have any problems with any other oatmeal types that we've tried but I was impressed by the DHA + probiotic and that the product is also organic. I also prefer the can over any type in a box"
1;"""I showed this to my son's pediatrician and he was impressed with (and supported!) the list of items added to the cereal!<br /><br />This was the first solids I added to my child's bottle when we started to transition away from milk only. The cereal is really finely milled and melts away easily into the liquid. At first I was worried that it would thicken up too much that it would clog the milk from flowing through"
1;"""We feed this to our twins. They've been on it a couple of months. I notice they seem less gassy using this cereal too. We've tried both the oatmeal and the rice and the kids like both of them. Sometimes we mix half with Earth's Best cereal to make it last longer. EDIT: It's been a few months since the original post. My kids are 10 months. They now prefer this to Earth's Best cereal. They'll eat them mixed together"
1;I have never been any happier since I found Happy Belly product. I serve my twins all their 3 flavors and they simply loved it. My son simply love the smell of his rice cereal. I can see their eyes glow whenever is rice cereal time. Their are also BPA free and organic which makes it all matter to me. Their Happy Melts and Puff were also my kids favorite a well.
1;"""I love this oatmeal. My baby had dairy allergies so that I had to eliminate all milk products from my diet while I was nursing him. He would have really bad diarheaa whenever I had anything that had even a small amount of milk in it. Shortly after I started feeding this cereal to him"
1;Our daughter is now 1 yrs old and loves this!  We mix it into everything she eats so that she gets the added DHA and vitamins since she is now off from formula.  I highly recommend this to any parent.  The quality is super and the results are a very healthy baby!
1;"""I love the fact that this cereal has probiotics in it and that it's organic.  My daughter has a very sensitive digestive track (although she will eat about anything we have made so far) and I think the added probiotics really help.  It sure keeps her regular that for sure!  I also like all the unique grains this particular cereal has"
1;I am picky about what I feed my daughter. Her health is in my hands and I intend on caring for it to the best of my ability. This is an amazing product. Probiotics are essential for human beings and babies are not an exception to that fact. We have the multigrain and oatmeal variety of this product. My daughter loves to eat both. I believe breakfast is one of her favorite meals of the day and it because she loves this product so much.
1;My baby loves this. He has regular Bowel movements maybe because of the Probiotics. Its got DHA which is good for eye and brain development. Sometimes we mix it with veggies or fruits. He gobbles it up when he is hungry. Plus it is organic food. All in all highly recommended!
1;My 7 month old LOVES to eat this cereal! I found that he prefers it plain than mixed with food! He likes the natural sweetness of it! I love the fact that it has quinoa and amaranth which is highly nutritious not to mention delicious. I also love the fact that it has probiotics because my baby has not had any digestion problems. The fact that it's all organic makes it all even better.
1;"""I tried another brand of organic brown rice and the babies didn't like it much and became constipated. Then I tried this brand of oatmeal and they loved it. Next I tried this brand of rice and found they love it too"
1;"""This stuff is fantastic!  My son started on rice cereal and wasn't a huge fan--but then we tried him on this oatmeal and he goos and gaas with joy and smacks his lips and smiles because of this oatmeal.<br /><br />Our grocery store doesn't carry this so we had to buy another brand one time--we thought  what's the diff--it's oatmeal right? <br /><br />My son got all excited since he thought he was getting fed--opened his mouth"
1;I am so excited to see that HappyBaby has cereal now!  My daughter loves their frozen organic baby food!  Plus the packaging is sooooo much better than the boxes 'other' cereals come in.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!
1;My son loves this stuff.  He likes it by itself or when it's mixed with fruits.  We were initially drawn to it at one of the local big box stores because it is multigrain and has DHA and probiotics.  Compared to plain old rice cereal I think this has been a much better choice.  After finding out that our son loves it we started getting it from Amazon and have put it on subscribe and save.  Our little guy is 11 months now and goes through the 6 pack in about a month.  Great product and a better price then we've been able to find locally (plus the convenience of getting it delivered).
1;"""Happybellies was the answer to my prayers. We first used Earth's Best and had allergy problems. What a mystery! I though rice cereal was supposed to be pure and natural....but discovered that not all brands have nut or soy free products. We switched our daughter to Happybellies and she's an eating monster. Not only is this product iron fortified"
1;I discovered the HappyBellies at Babies R Us and didn't know anything about it. (btw it is more expensive there) We started our baby on it in 4 months. She LOVES it and it is good for her belly. She used to be constipated from time to time even on the breast milk. Now she is much more regular. Once i could not find the HappyBellies rice cereal at the store and got the Earth Best instead. The baby didn't like it and it was hard to feed through the bottle<br /><br />The only problem i have is what's up with the 3/4 of the container? Why it is not as full as it's used to be? Keeping static price in expense of the quantity i guess? oh well...economy it is
1;I make my own baby food - it tastes much better than the canned baby food and introduces them to the taste of real food. The only exception is that I give them the Happy Bellies oatmeal as well as their rice and multigrain. These have extra iron formulated to be easily absorbed and also the probiotics which are probably part of the reason both babies are nice and regular. They're organic and whole grain so they're healthy and train the babies taste to like whole grain. I mix it with water and they gobble it up and love it.
1;We live in Costa Rica and I'm shipping this product here because our pediatrician recommended this cereal to help in the esophagus reflux of our 4 months old daughter's. The idea was to make her formula a little bit thicker so she wouldn't experience the reflux that much. I'm not really sure if any other doctor is using this product for this purpose but it actually worked great with our daughter
1;Give your pet some tasty organic treats. I discovered Laughing Dog at a street fair where they were giving free samples away for some very happy dogs. The staff is very friendly and answered all of my questions. If you are looking to get a special treat for your dog you should really try these.
1;My dog is on a meat free diet due to severe food alllergies. She loves this food and her coat is actually coming back in areas which there was no hair. I rotate this and another vegan dog food sold here on Amazon. I will be ordering more soon! The price is cheaper on here then at Petsmart.
1;"""My secret weapon to perform hard work with a great attitude.  Guanine (a caffeine analog) gives a long lasting stimulant boost while theobromine provides the attitude adujstment of chocolate.  A wonderful delight that got me to quit coffee which is jittery"
1;"""This stuff is fantastic. I agree with the other complimentry reviews. might i suggest mixing a small amount of this powder with a shot of olive oil?! I actually think it may lengthen the effect even mnore by doing this and it is a fat soluble so it's a lot easier to get down. Because of the chemistry of this molecule"
1;Home roasting is a neat little adventure that my wife and I got into just a few months ago. We have tried a few different coffees now and the best so far is this Peruvian High grown stuff. The quality is very good from the distributor and we are very happy having ordered from them a couple times. Try it you will like it!
1;My first purchase of this was my first foray into home roasting and it was some of the best coffee I've ever tasted... out of a popcorn popper!<br /><br />I'm ordering another batch to roast up some spiced coffee for Christmas gifts (pumpkin spice).<br /><br />This specific origin seems like an excellent base for building flavors... it's incredibly smooth with a nice body.
1;"""Our Akita almost died from a congenital digestive defect.  We couldn't find any food that she could tolerate - and definitely no treats that wouldn't make her sick.  (We finally found Wellness dog food"
1;"""I really did not want to review this marmalade because it is soo good and soo hard to find. When Amazon finally had it I bought all available jars of it (nine)so I should be set for a while. it has a spectacular taste"
1;"""I've been consuming this every morning for over a year now.Wonderful with some fresh fruit or dried fruit. The smaller single serving packs are perfect for work or travel. Those of you Bariatric pts should really try this. Start your day with high protien ( add skim milk) without the bloat and sickening sweet shakes.Those shakes make you want sweets/carbs"
1;"""I was hunting for rasberry honey mustard to dip pretzels in since Omaha Steaks no longer makes theirs so I checked this website. Since there were so many of the same bottle I checked them all to add up prices and shipping (which I find annoying done on a per item basis!). I was thrilled when the last one I checked was the cheapest and happened to be from a company that I was considering reordering some other items. American Spice Company has a set shipping charge no matter the size of the order so I knew I had found my new source for mustard. When it came"
1;My little guys are getting older and beginning to limp and tremble at bit in the hind legs.  I give them Zuke's as treats and I'm assured they're getting very beneficial supplements for their achy joints.  They love them!
1;"""I ordered this looking for a great price and never really thought about what 5 pounds of Matzos would look like.  Well when the box arrived I wondered what on earth I had ordered.  When I opened it I had to LAUGH at the size of 5 pounds of crackers.  They came in good condition and will last me a while and when I finish these"
1;"""Nothing beats the taste of Yorkshire Red!  It wakes me in the morning and continues to support my day when I need to mull things over! It makes great iced tea too! The best thing is that it actually tastes like REAL TEA"
1;"""Interesting to read the other reviews - especially the ones that comment about the bugs.  We've been using Swheat Scoop since we adopted our cat in May of 2010 and haven't had a single problem with it.  There is only one local retailer that carries it and only in box form.  Maybe the bags can be infiltrated more easily by the bugs? Maybe it's the timing of maufacture and the environmental conditions at the factory or warehouse"
1;"""I have a German Shorthaired Pointer (3 yrs old) and a Lab mix (12 yrs old) and this food is great for both of them. I have heard vets compare this food to a Science Diet or better and it's much less expensive. Great food"
1;I switched over to this food from a more expensive one due to finances.  My dog likes it and so far is doing well on it.  I liked the delivery of this product.  It was nice not having to drive ot the next town to purchase dog food.
1;If you like Iced Tea but not the Caffeine this is the product for you.  It was a while before I knew this product was out but I switched right away.  Costs more than the regular but who needs more caffeine.
1;"""I am a blue buffalo fanatic.  I have a 16 year old teacup poodle and a 1 year old mini-weiner and I have both of them on Blue food and treats.<br /><br />I like the health bars because I do not feel guilty to give them multiple every day.  I have bacon egg and cheese"
1;"""I purchased this blend in a local market in Philadelphia for my foodie husband. He loves to grill and is an immensely talented cook. I often try to find him different spices and rubs to cook with and this has been a knockout win. He said it is the favorite gift he has received from me in that this is a delicious and unique salt rub. Keep in mind we have been together for 8 years and this is not the first time I have ever bought him something to cook with. He was amazed at the moistness (spelling?) of it and can use the rub for anything. Now"
1;"""I have purchased these in a can before and sometimes they seem to pick up a metal flavor.  These dolmas are amazingly yummy.  They are not packed with tons of liquid so you get a lot of product in the can.  With that in mind"
1;These are pretty good. I haven't tried any other brand of these but just judging this brand alone I would buy again. The price is good and the product taste great. I eat 12 of them as a lunch so they don't last very long.
1;"""I bought 4 of those boxes to serve as one element of an antipasto in a large party. Everybody was satisfied and requested that I use this same supply for our next year party.  Only one negative comment: there were not 60 by box as expected"
1;I have been buying this granola for years. It is so delicious especially with Greek yogurt. My lunches are very enjoyable because I look forward to mixing the two together. Its like a treat and so satisfying. Give this a try with yogurt. It's a nutritious meal or even just a little snack in a bag.  I'm very happy Amazon is carrying this product!
1;I can not imagine not having this most delicious and relaxing beverage. I take mine in the evening and always become relaxed and then spend beautiful time with my family and friends. Simply the best for a calm close of the day.
1;I love this tea!  My favorite part is that the tea bags are NOT individually wrapped and don't have a string.  I use this tea in my Iced Tea Maker (by Mr Coffee) and it works perfectly because I don't have to unwrap all the bags.
1;I am forever looking for a tea i can have as my go-to and i think i finally found it! this stuff is WONDERFUL! the smell is fantastic and the taste is light and has a good peppermint taste that isn't overwhelming at all. i love this tea!
1;"""It's a wonderful product-great peppermint taste and very fresh. My son was amazed when he smelled it brewing this afternoon!  It must really be fresh because it smells a lot more 'pepperminty' than what you buy in the stores"
1;If you're like me and simply love peppermint in all it's forms then this tea is for you... it's more or less like drinking a liquid candy-cane!  Hmmmmmmm.  Plus it has the added benefit of calming an upset stomach.<br /><br />Take that Wintergreen and Spearmint!!
1;"""I tried this tea when I had given up on western medicine. I needed help with my pms irregularities. This is a great product to go with DIM and Emerita pro-gest. I had'nt had a period in months and I drank this tea and I finally started. It was great. It also helps with mood swings. Traditional Medincials is a company that can be trusted"
1;These were amazing candies. I'm very picky about jelly beans and I'm often afraid to invest in experimentation but I love honey so much that I had to try these. The different flavors vary in the prevalence of honey flavor (surprisingly I found that the honey one had a very mild flavor) but they are all delicious. They also had a good texture with a coating that was not too hard or too thick.
1;"""I don't eat sweets but I eat fudge and have had the pleasure of tasting many a fine recipe but none have been as tasty as Mo's - none.<br />I tried the standard chocolate and the vanila crunch and it was to die for.  I reluctantly shared it with four others who were really taken back about how good the fudge was so it's not just me - it was a hit all the way around :).<br />One thing to note is the fudge ( I bought 1/2lb of each) came in a lovely decorative box totally suitable for gift giving so you could purchase and have it sent directly as a gift knowing that it will be arrive wrapped nicely and professionally.<br />In my reviews I like to include the  cons  but there simply are none for Mo's Fudge - I will never buy any other fudge again and doubt you will either after you give theirs a try."""
1;I either got lucky twice or this stuff staves off an oncoming cold. My three grandkids are with me all the time and are all under three years old. That means a lot of colds. I got sick of being sick and decided to try this product. So far it worked. It is easy to take and tastes fine. I will be taking some tonight since all three are little snot factories again. Keeping my fingers crossed.
1;I'm new to this Emergen-C and I just love them.  I'm not normally a fan of lemonade or pink lemonade but I bought these for my son originally and have no problem taking them.  They really help with my sore throat big time.  Good stuff.
1;We have an indoor potted azalea. It was turning yellow and regularly would lose leaves. We've had it about 4 years. Within a week of watering it with Miracle-Grow it turned green and now looks likes it's thriving. Miracle grow is so easy to mix with water and use.
1;"""I have been using this fertilizer for years on the recommended plants.  But this year I decided to try it on some other plants that typically you would not use this on.<br />I live in an area that gets lots of freezes and frosts and some occasional snow"
1;"""If I want to make Bear Creek Soups I put them in the crock pot to cook on low for 8 hours and get wonderful results.  For the Chili I add 1 can of green chili and diced tomato and a can of tomato paste with a couple of soup can's of water"
1;This is sooo tasty and very low in calories.  So many low cal foods don't have much flavor but this one has both.  I made a couple of changes - because I love the flavor of tomatoes I decreased the water from 7 cups to 6 cups and added a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes to the water.  I also added a can of black beans (drained)to it.  I was trying to keep the calories down so didn't add meat but imagine that would be good also.  Try it....
1;"""We've been eating this for years. In fact since before they changed the name. It was originally named with a three letter word (similar to darn) that Amazon won't let me write. We've tried quite a number of variations of this and it always turns out good. Sausage works well. Add cream cheese"
1;"""We live out in the country and we were happy to find we could order our favorite chili through Amazon.Com.  It shipped that very night and we had it within just a few days.<br /><br />This is our favorite chili. It's so easy to make and it doesn't take much time (about 30 to 40 minutes.) We seem to always have chicken or turkey"
1;This is DARN GOOD CHILI! I make this for diner when I am tired and feel like a no hassle meal. Just add some water and a small can of tomato paste and Voila! Diner is served. It's also very low on points plus if you are trying to follow the program.
1;"""I use this product as a base for my own chile.  I follow their receipt but:  Brown about 1.5 Lbs of ground beef with 2 medium chopped onions and 2 or 3 cloves of fresh garlic (or more to taste) in the bottom of the chile pot. Instead of adding water"
1;Not just the name - this is the best chili ever.  This used to be a regular item in our local grocery store but then it was discontinued.  I found it on Amazon.com and love it.  (I do add a little of my own spices at the end to make it spicier.)
1;This product is excellent. I also add a can of Hunts canned chili mix with my lean ground beef. Then I mix the darn good chili with the meat mix. I would recommend this product to anyone who loves good chili.
1;"""We have been hooked on this chili for a few years now and it recently became unavailable at our local grocery store so we're frantically looking for another place that might have it.<br /><br />We typically add a half-pound of cooked hamburger and then throw it in a bowl"
1;"""Tried this for the first time last night and it was excellent. I added browned ground chuck and it was yummy! Just enough spice to tell it is chili but not hot at all. We are chili eaters so we didn't skimp on the bowl size but there was still enough for another meal left over. Hey"
1;My mother always made her chili using the French's Chili-o Mix by following the directions and using Ranch Style beans. It is the perfect combination of flavors and a chili tradition for our family. I have had a difficult time finding it in my local store since I relocated. Luckily it is easily located thru Amazon and our taste buds are not deprived. It is the perfect blend of spices!
1;"""I wanted to try something new and bought this moroccan mint and the orange spice teas by Numi last year. I loved them both but I find this moroccan mint is my ultimate favorite tea! I am so very glad I found this tea! I LOVE it!! If you like a sweet mint flavor this is the tea for you! Delicious!! I have given one to every tea loving person I know and they ALL loved it!<br /><br />I rarely drink any tea but Numi anymore. It is a bit pricey compared to other name brand teas but so worth every penny in my opinion! Plus"
1;"""I have been a herbal tea drinker for many years and when I try a new brand I expect to be disappointed.  Numi's Moroccan Mint Tea is fresh tasting with full-bodied flavor and a clean finish.<br />I love that the tea bags are fully organic"
1;"""I got into mint tea when I first started drinking tea and didn't really like black or green teas.  I started with other brands like Celestial Seasonings and Stash and tried Numi mint tea with a coupon once.  The difference is strong and Numi mint tea has deeper"
1;I was originally using the Traditional Medicinal's brand peppermint tea along with the Dandelion Root because I could not stand the taste of the dandelion by itself. I have to say this one has a much more mellow taste and the price is far better. I have taken to having a cup after dinner and it makes for a very enjoyable evening experience. I normally sweeten it with a teaspoon or two of light organic agave nectar. It just takes the taste over the top. I initially thought a six pack would be overkill but after having a few cups I see that I am going to breeze through my supply relatively quickly.
1;"""The following recommendation is based on having enjoyed over 100 tea varieties in the last 3+ years.<br /><br />When steeped as recommended...<br />it tastes great....<br />for more flavor steep longer...<br />also tastes great then too.<br /><br />Try it.<br /><br />Karleton Helfer"
1;"""I just finished my first can of this. Delicious! I have been looking for a tuna packed in olive oil. Found this & bought it. Was $1.48 per can at meijers. The olive oil was evoo(extra virgin olive oil)"
1;I've been buying it for the past 2 years at the 'mart' store.  Can't beat the taste for the price.  Drain off the oil and it take very little mayo to make a moist tuna salad.  I also like to use it right out of the can on a greek type salad with feta.
1;I found this product when I lived in Hawaii 20 years ago and have used it ever since.  It has a wonderful flavor that is better than many fried rice dishes I have been served in restaurants.  I have tried many times with the help of Asian friends to make a comparable seasoning mix for my homemade fried rice and always went back to using the NOH's brand.  I am not sure why I tried for so long since this product is delicious and inexpensive to use.
1;The fried rice mix makes up a dinner that tastes just like the best restaurants. The kimchi mix makes some of the best kimchi I've eaten and at about 1/10th the cost of a jar from the stores. I definitely will be buying more of these products.......
1;"""Every time I've introduced this rice to people they've been amazed that this is brown rice. It's delicious and always used in my home instead of white rice. I prepare it in my rice cooker on the white rice setting as it says on the bag. I add a touch more water than asked to make it a softer texture that I prefer.<br />The rice comes out lighter in color than other brown rice that I've used. At times"
1;"""This is the first and only meal replacement that I have ever tried but I have read and heard about how the taste of some are just awful. With that being said I consider myself lucky. Simply because the Naturade barvarian chocolate and strawberry flavors are really pretty good.<br /><br />I usually mix with either lactaid milk (2%)or rice milk (vanilla flavored)and I have tried water. I shake mine"
1;"""I first tried these drops when a friend left them at my house by accident.  I instantly loved it and ended up using the rest of the bottle over the next few weeks!  (Note to self buy a replacement for my buddy!) One to two drops and you will have SUPER minty breath.  I use them at work and people twenty feet away will start saying they smell peppermint :)<br /><br />They can be very strong so start off with one drop and work your way up.  Currently I will use two to three drops on my the back of my hand and then lick it up.  It sounds funny but these are the directions for use.  I believe you can also mix a drop or two with a glass of water and use as mouthwash.  If I eat something like onions or garlic I will use up to four drops"
1;These are the most flavorful gummi bears I have ever tasted. I came back and ordered the 5 pound bag after just trying a few. They are incredibly soft and have a great mouth feel. I shared some with my coworkers and now they ask for them all the time! I haven't heard a bad thing about them yet. Definitely worth it to go for the 5 lb bag.
1;"""This honestly good.  It does not taste like syrup or cough medicine like one of the reviewers raves.  It taste like carbonated water with a hint of Raspberry flavoring.  Everything is natural and if you add some of your favorite juice like lets say...Orange"
1;I first tried chai tea when I was in Nepal about 9 years ago and this is the only chai that I have found that comes close to the chai I had there.  The others I've tried have all been to heavy on one spice or another and this blend is perfect.  I have it every morning and subscribe to have it delivered to me automatically every few months.  I'm very thankful I can order it from Amazon because none of the stores in my area carry it.  I highly recommend it.
1;I have been consuming this as my staple morning beverage for the past 3 years. I have not found any other spiced tea (either loose or in a bag) that comes close to the strong and invigorating flavor of this tea. This is good tea.
1;Amazon is one of the few places I have been able to purchase Lipton Chai Tea.  Its so good and if I don't have it in the mornings I'm not going to have a good day.  Its great with honey.  I ordered it from the company and then from Amazon and its more economical from Amazon.
1;"""I have been drinking this for at least a couple of years and then could  not find it anywhere in Walmart in my store or two other states. Or others stores I shopped either. Needless to say I was thrilled to find it online and at a reasonable price. This is the second time I have ordered it from you.I always order several boxes because I am afraid I won"
1;"""This is the best Chai tea I've found available on the commercial market.  Hot or iced it's delicious.  Add a little non fat or sugar free french vanilla creamer and you have the best latte.  I used to be able to find it at Wal Mart"
1;"""I love this Chai tea and it is so much less expensive than getting some at a coffee shop. Other brands just do not have the flavor I (or my Chai Loving Daughter) care for. This has a mild mixture of all the spices normally found in chai with none overwealming the others. Mixing in milk and sugar or sweetener makes the Chai Tea Latte a warm comforting drink for morning"
1;Its a great tasting tea with subtle hint of many spices. Tea tastes great with milk or without.Also works great for vegans who want to drink strong tea without milk. Surprisingly Spiced Chai is not always available in all leading grocery stores and if you do find one then you may not always find it in stock. it was great to find a bulk pack available from trusted Amazon so we did not have to worry about looking for it or missing it!
1;This seasoning packet is excellent with any meat or poultry.  I used it several times while grilling and cooking in the oven.  Great flavor and I got nothing but praise.  I highly recommend everyone try it.  You won't be disappointed.
1;This is a great soup mix. I didn't find it salty at all. I actually add some seasoning and stir in frozen veggies and spinach. I've ordered on more than one occasion and recommend it. You can experiment with the consistency by adding or subtracting the amount of water used. I find it comes out less thick by keeping it covered as it cooks. otherwise it tends to get pretty thick. Its all your preference though.
1;Bought these at Whole Foods to try....and the flavor is well balanced and you get a nice suttle banana flavor.  Am a vegan and chef so I struggle to fine well balanced bars....but this one delivers.  I'll be ordering from Amazon because of their great prices.  Not sure about the other flavors so will try and report back.  I don't believe you'll be disappointed with this bar...with realistic expecations of what vegan bars can deliver on.
1;"""I use gum arabic powder in making Gomme Syrup for sweetening various classic mixed drinks.  Different web sites have wildly differing prices for what amounts to the same material.  This is the least expensive I have found and it works as well as any other brand I've used.  Thank you"
1;A bit more than I needed in one order but it id hard to find whole white peppercorns locally. White pepper tends to be a bit hotter than black pepper. It is nice to use in foods like cream sauce that you don't want to see the pepper flakes.
1;Ka-Me Bean Threads has a much better texture than those of cheap Chinese brands. I found Ka-Me at Kroger and then ordered whole lot from Amazon twice. Very happy with the online discount price. Will never go back to the cheap low quality Chinese brands.
1;"""I get my favorite Earl Grey (Supreme) from Harney and I saw this tea while perusing their website. I bought a tin of sachets simply out of curiosity and it was a fantastic decision. The tea itself smells like Thin Mints - sooo yummy! - but the taste is mild and refreshing. It's like a peppermint tea but with much more depth than regular herbal teas. It's great for after dinner"
1;"""Let me start off by saying that these product by Jack Links are very attractively priced and fulfill a specific snacking need for me. When I read that these were bulk packed and that I would not have all this additional packaging to dispose of"
1;"""My dog loves this food and it has really cut back on the tear staining issues.  The staining was a big problem and I did quite a bit of research to find a solution. I considered a few products that you add to the dog food or come in pill form and several of these apparently  work however many of them are actually antibiotics I am not sure it is a good idea to use very often.  My research  led me to antioxidants (like blueberries) and avoiding wheat to cut back on the tear stains and give him a healthier coat. This food is not only grain free but is also loaded with blueberries.<br /><br />Yes"
1;We love soyrizo but Hannaford Brothers (in the Northeast) are no longer carrying it.  I called the whole foods store and they don't carry it either.  What's up with that?? The price of the soyrizo and shipping charges on amazon are prohibitive.  We are so very disappointed to not have access to this product anymore!!
1;Def a cool product. It really tastes like water! I can taste a slight mineral taste if I drive it at room temperature but if its cold it really refreshing and doesn't have a taste at all. My kids love it too!
1;I am a half-caf drinker and I brew one cup of this Donut House Decaf and one cup of Donut House regular and get THE BEST cup of home-brewed coffee ever! Wish Amazon would put them on the Subscribe and Save list because I would get this delivered regularly!  Love it!
1;"""I am pregnant and have been enjoying a variety of decaf coffees for the last 9 months.  This coffee is the absolute best in decaf for Keurig.  I have tried probably 20+ different flavors and I can say with complete confidence this is my favorite.  I have had the Donut House regular and it is awesome as well.  I've drank it with cream hot and over ice.  Listen--I drink coffee every single day of my life since for like 15 years"
1;I have tried a lot of decaf coffee and this has the best taste of any.  It is so good that I believe I could give up the regular coffee.  Amazon offers it with free shipping and the convenience is great.
1;"""I wanted to try a decaf coffee for after dinner and found the Donut House Decaf to be very good.  I was a little leery because it was labelled Extra Bold - Light Roast.  Wasn't sure what that label meant - was it going to be very strong (extra bold) or was it going to taste too weak (light roast)?  I don't like real strong coffee or weak coffee"
1;"""USE DONUT HOUSE k-CUP DAILY.  EXCELLENT TASTE.  I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PURCHASE COFFEE AT ANY RETAIL COFFEE HOUSE THAT HAS A BETTER FLAVOR.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK >Donut Shop K-Cup packs for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>"""
1;This is a great decaf coffee. It's not bland and has a very good taste. It's labeled Extra Bold but is not too strong tasting or bitter. It's the only decaf that I have found so far for the Keurig that I enjoy.
1;"""This coffee has a nice bold flavor without being bitter.  It actually does remind me of a Dunkin' Donut cup of coffee.  Plus it's decaf which I like because I can drink it anytime.  If you like a Dunkin' Donut type of coffee and you're looking for a good decaf"
1;I was reluctant to order beef jerky online but did anyway and to my surprise it was shipped and received on time and the quality and freshness of the beef jerky was excellent!<br /><br />Thank you Nothing but the Best!
1;"""Perfect bunch of Tic Tacs. They were as advertised and promised. Sent them to my Dad of whom suffers from dry mouth. This was the perfect remedy. I love the number offered as my Dad is wheel chair bound and can't just get up and go shopping to purchase his own. We live clear across the country from one another so"
1;"""These are just the right size for a quick reward and as a treat for  I'm sorry I was away so long - thank you for understanding  or any other excuse you can find to treat your pet because you always have the happy tail wag afterwards! My dogs gave this treat 5 woofs!!!  So that must be good!"""
1;I bought this gift for my Mother's birthday.  I live in Indiana and she lives in Florida so I was not going to have the ability to wrap it.  When it came it looked like a ready to go present and she said the taste was fantastic.  Great buy!
1;"""I am a Snapple diet peach tea drinker and when I saw that they had come out with an instant  on the go  I was ecstatic. I was not happy with the flavor or the way it didn't dissolve easily. However this crystal light version is so much better. The flavor is not exactly like the Snapple but it is very pleasant and it dissolves perfectly. I actually use more water to mix it than suggested just to stretch it out a little but it still has a good flavor."""
1;This Pecan Pie really made an international journey. My son has been living in China for the past year and was really lonely for some good old fashion American food for the holidays. Pecan Pie is one of the favorites. We saw this boxed pie and couldn't pass it up! But we were surprised to learn how few ovens there are in China. Most of the food is steamed and fried. The lack of an oven was disappointing and we didn't hear much more until my son told me he had found some friends who had an American style oven and he had cooked the pie for them! It was really a huge hit. I notice this company makes other pies and I think I will send other over. I strongly suggest this 'pie in a box' for anyone who wants to give a special treat!
1;My grandsons love chocolate chip pancakes and I gave them a can of the Stonewall mix at Christmas.  They wanted more and I looked everywhere for it .  Then it occurred to me to look on Amazon and there it was!  I bought the pack of three and they are thrilled.  The boys can get up in the morning and make pancakes before they go to school.  It is easy and they always turn out beautifully.  Yum.
1;Chef Paul never disappoints. I've been using his seasonings for many years and I just love them. This pack is great. I use the Poultry and Meat Magics the most. Make sure you have enough recipes on hand to use and enjoy them all!
1;Great Dog food. Have been searching for a dog food that doesn't contain corn and animal by-products that dog food companies like to use as fillers and cheap ingredients. This is definitely the best and most affordable one I found. I have been using it for about a year for my 2year Welsh Corgi and he loves it.
1;I think we bought about 8 bags of this Merrick Whole Earth Farms adult dry dog food and so far the first bag is working out well.  We have a few dogs and we usually get a couple of 35-40 lb bags but it is hard to store but this 8 lb bags are convenient and easier to store if you like to stock up.  The ingredients are good and our dogs seem to like the food and they have not had any digestive issues.  Will probably buy this again in the future.
1;"""I am so glad I tried this premium dog food at a great price for a small (but not too small) bag to try it. My dog loves it and I feel better about giving her something healthy. Next I will try the canned food. I do wish these companies would offer 6 can deals however instead of just 12 and 24 can deals for  taste-testing . Not every dog likes a drastic change from junk foods to higher quality food. Meanwhile"
1;I have fund this dog food to be a extremely good bang for my buck. It packs as much if not more extra Nutrients Like salmon oil Even better yet this does not contain Corn which is common dog food filler that is not particularly healthy for dogs since I was used to paying little less then 50 cents more then a dollar a pound was kinda hard to sallow but for me have a Jack Russel terrier its not so bad its a small kibble packed with the right stuff I have not found any better bang for my buck
1;Popcorn PERFECTION! When they say it's premium popcorn they aren't kidding! High quality popcorn with outstanding flavor. The cheese pack is GREAT! Outstanding real cheese flavor without that cheap acidic taste. Also the popcorn isn't overly greasy. You won't have grease all over your fingers. It's priced a lot higher than the competitors but it's worth it. It doesn't get any better than this!
1;"""Our pack of 4 dogs and their 5 foster siblings are happily chomping away on their Good Buddy Rawhide Sticks while we are writing this review.We have always trusted Castor & Pollux products --we rescued 3 skinny sarcoptic mange puppies a while back and they thrived while getting fed <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084FO766 >Castor And Pollux Natural Ultramix Puppy Dry Dog Food</a> and  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LWCS08 >Organix Organix Puppy Dry Dog Food"
1;I search for USA made products for my dogs all the time and was very glad when I found this brand.  Our toy poodles love them.  Will continue to purchase these as long as the company keeps their manufacturing facility here in the US.
1;"""Other rawhide chews sometimes gave our dog tummy trouble and so we have since switched to MADE IN USA products. Interesting reading: FDA pet food recall list.  Our dog loves these and they seem to digest well.  She's a big dog and will chew and eat these rawhides in a matter of 10-20 minutes"
1;I bought one of these a while ago and what i would suggest is sharing it with people so that it gets eaten quickly because if you do not then it will get hard pretty fast and it will be far less satisfying.
1;Love starting the day with Starbucks Pike Place.  Full Rich flavor -- nice clear flavor.  So convenient to order from Amazon.  We  live in a small town without a Starbucks.  The Starbuck's store in closest city isn't always in stock.
1;The tea tastes great. I can no longer find it in my local store. I believe it to be decaf because I drink it at night and it doesn't keep me up. Who cares what it says on the package. The price keeps fluctuating. I just wish it would settle down to about 3.00 a box instead of 4. You will enjoy it.
1;This stuff is potent. I mean it. I have tried a lot of hot sauces. A friend of mine who is into Peru suggested I try this. I was impressed. It is hard to describe a hot sauce because you really need to try it.<br />There are more potent ones around but they are often too hot to use by themselves. This is just right.
1;Tried this chocolate because I had heard about chocolate and sea salt. This chocolate is creamier than most dark chocolate. The sea salt is a lovely addition to the chocolate. Will look for their chocolate bar with Coffee!
1;"""I was a bit skeptical buying a tinned fish product that is flavored or spiced. My thinking is that it must be so nasty and foul that it NEEDS to be pre spiced?  I was proven wrong. You get a nice firm boneless fillet that is devoid of heads"
1;"""I don't even like vanilla flavoring.  I'm more of a chocolate shake kind of guy.  But I have to say this was quite delicious.  Almost like it shouldn't be good for you!<br /><br />The last protein shake I had was grainy"
1;"""I used to be a big fan of Jet Fuel but I found it to be a little bitter. I ordered revv as part of a promotion with Keurig and I am amazed at how good this coffee is.<br />It definitely has the same kick as Jet Fuel but it's sooo smooth. I didn't think a coffee this strong could be this smooth. I love it.<br />I was worried when I ordered 2 boxes  in a buy 2 get 2 deal. I thought  what if I don't like it?  But I went ahead to balance the order out. Now I'm sorry I didn't get 4 boxes of the stuff.<br />If you like your coffee with a kick"
1;"""Gatorade Frost Glacier Freeze is another great flavor.  I LOVE this blue powered drink and it reminds me of the raspberry blue Kool-Aid years ago.  Its 3 pounds of easy to mix  ( hardly have to shake or stir this at all )which makes many gallons of Gatorade.  Its very refreshing and a different twist on the flavor being a berry vs a citrus.  Its much cheaper than soda pop and easy and fast to make for picinics and outdoor events for a large crowd.<br />12 fl ounces has 80 calories"
1;I got this sauce for a Christmas present.I was not expecting it to be as good as it was.Although i thought it was a bit mild the taste made up for the lack of burn.This versatile sauce has great depth of flavor and I highly recommend it.I polished off the whole bottle in two days.That says it all!
1;"""I sent this basket to my sister after she had surgery. She absolutely love it. She shared it with her adult children and was telling them about the different candy. We used to buy some of this at the store as  penny  candy. The candy was great and it also brought back some fond memories."""
1;If your looking at this popcorn then it obvious your looking for something hot. In comparrison to others I've tested none compare. the flavor in this popcorn is spicy good and is in flavor done well as a chili taste and less like other products a spicy pepper taste. If you get a chance just try a bag. emm emm good.
1;After finding this cheese I ordered some and was delighted that I received the cheese in its freshest state well wrapped to preserve it and shipped in a cooler type box that got to me in a two day period as promised by the company.
1;"""Great for abrasions.  Kept a slow healing/nonhealing venus ulcer on my father's leg infection free and actually healed it.  He had it for years and all the stuff the doctor's prescribed from the specialized wound care center hadn't been able to heal it.  Lots of stuff now on the market which may not be as good.  Read carefully about Manuka Honey and the various stuff that is being sold.  Seems like many companies have jumped on it and I'm not sure all are as pure or really from New Zealand Manuka  bee farms ."""
1;When I investigated the Manuka Honey I was amazed at the studies showing how wonderful and healing it is for our bodies.  This Wound and Burn Dressing is a great item to have on your shelf for the unexpected incidents and accidents that can happen around the home.
1;I had an open wound that the folks at the wound care clinic couldn't get to close after 2 1/2 months. Bought the manuka honey and 3 weeks later the wound was completely closed. Great natural wound care product.
1;For a non-sugar candy sweetened by Xylitol these are great.  The taste is similar to a sugar candy and doesnt have the strange aftertaste that I have found on some of the other Xylitol candy.  I am able to eat these without much guilt and still enjoy the taste.
1;"""This is wonderful food. I feed my lab a raw meat diet but you could easily add cooked beef or chicken as well. It's easy to make up a batch for the day or to make/freeze  in advance in case you'll be away or super-busy for awhile. My black lab Ally has been thriving on this food for over three years. She has  no skin irritations"
1;"""I have been using Dr. Harvey's Canine Health Miracle Dog food for more than 4 years. I found this product through a friend who has dogs with similar finicky eating habits. My two dogs would pick at or just turn their noses up to any of the generally available brands in the supermarket as well as food I got at my vet. They had also been having skin irritation problems. As soon as we changed to Dr Harvey's they wolfed down the food and after a couple months the skin irritation problems disappeared. Both dogs (1 Border Collie 13yrs and 1 BC/Australian Sheppard mix 16 yrs) had developed arthritis in hip and shoulder joints prior to starting the new food and again after a few months of the new food their pain level seemed to decrease. When the BC was 15 we had blood work done and the Vet said she had never seen blood so clean for a dog this old. We are sold on the properties of this food"
1;"""Our 7 year old boxer is allergic to many store brand dog foods. We spent months trying to find one that didn't make him sick. The solution in the end was to make his dog food ourselves. It was quite a procedure since he's 70 pounds"
1;"""I credit my 11 1/2 year old golden retriever's continued good health to Dr. Harvey's Canine Health.  I have been feeding Cleo this food for 11 years after searching for something to relieve her puppy allergies.  If I run out and feed her something else"
1;This one has so much flavoring. My kids and husband both love it. Its a lower salt seasoning with such vibrant flavoring. I use it when making eggs for breakfast all the way to making gumbo for Christmas. I would recommend this to my family and friends.
1;"""When looking for a  green  signature drink for a geeky wedding we came across the Finish This Drink recipe. It called for Kiwi syrup which we could not find locally in any store. Amazon to the rescue - this Monin kiwi syrup made a yummy drink!!"""
1;"""My whole family enjoys these crackers which for me as a concerned Mother with all the falsely advertised products titled  All Natural . There are only a few ingredients that make up these crackers and the nutrients found in those will amaze you!"""
1;Drank Typhoo tea all the years that we lived in England.  We continue to drink it every day.  Love this blend.  It is robust and very clean tasting.  We love it.  It is not 'flavored'.  It is a typical english tea.
1;"""I was in London and my friend brought Typoo Tea to share with me.  I ran out of the tea and thought I would check Amazon.com to see if I could buy more.  I was so surprise to find exactly what I was looking for!  Now"
1;"""If you like black tea you'll love Typhoo. I saw it mentioned on an English show and as always thank you Amazon for carrying things no where else does. This is a really strong black tea that you have to make correctly (read: can't just leave the tea bag in like most Americans do...) and goes best with a little milk. My roommate (who has given me a hard time for having an unreasonably large quantity of tea"
1;"""These smaller sized Sprout Master sprouters are great for smaller batches of leafy sprouts or bean sprouts. The optional tray dividers makes it easy to make small batches of as many as six different sprouts at a time. The larger tray would be better for big batches"
1;"""This item is wonderful for growing smaller crops of several varieties for consumption. I love the white as well so I can SEE it is clean.<br /><br />I enjoy sprouts over lettuce on sandwiches and in salads"
1;"""No caffeine and tasted wonderful. Glad I got the 12 pack of this. I take 2 cups of water to a boil and remove from heat. Drop in 5 tea bags and steep for 5 minutes (don't let it go much beyond 5 minutes"
1;"""While in Thailand for 3 weeks many years ago I discovered  ginger tea  which was (to me) a tasty and warming beverage that calmed my stomach. It took a long time to find an equivalent drink once I got back"
1;Buying Jelly Belly this way is roughly $1.50 cheaper by the pound.  The local candy store in the mall does sell it by the pound... and you can pick only the flavors you want.  BUT it is more expensive.  And it seems like every time I pass the store the price has gone up.
1;I USE TO PURCHASE IS PRODUCT IN MY LOCAL GROCERY STORE. THEY DON'T CARRY THIS  BRAND ANYMORE. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. I FOUND IT AGAIN ON AMAZON.COM AND ORDERED HAZELNUT AND VANILLA FLAVORINGS. (MY FAVORITES !) I JUST USE ONE TABLET IN MY COFFEE. I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT OVERPOWERING LIKE SOME OF THE SYRUPS AND COFFEE HOUSES USE....AND IT'S SUGAR-FREE.
1;"""These are the most convenient coffee creamers I have ever found.  No more messy powder packets that could pop open and ruin my purse.  I loved these from the first day I saw them.  They are a blessing for traveling.  Now it doesn't matter what flavor coffee establishments have"
1;This chili is great tasting and very filling. One can will easily feed 2 people. It is a medium spicy tasting chili but you can always up the heat if you want with a shot of hot sauce and more spices.<br />It is the best tasting vegetarian canned chili i have tried and i highly recommend.<br />Serve it with some nice crusty bread and you got yourself a whole meal.
1;Great tasting chili. We just add a tiny bit of chili powder and top it off with some cheese and we have a delicious meal. Much healthier than regular chili and yet still full of flavor. An excellent substitute for the real thing.
1;We've had this chili before. It is good and you can use it so many ways. We just wanted to have a few cans of this and other foods on hand so we don't have to run to the store when we need a can to put into something. This is just so convenient. And the taste is best next to homemade.
1;Ok i have been eating this since i was a kid and this is one of the things i never get tired of eating<br /><br />once when i could not get it (not always in stock) i tried Amy's Chili and IMO Amy's is watered down Salsa with beans its NOT A MEAT ALTERNATIVE CHILI<br /><br />Worthingtons Chili is very thick and is very meat like if you put a spoon in a can of Worthington Chili it will not move<br />with Amy's the spoon will fall over and is NOTHING LIKE MEAT more like a dip<br /><br />I make it with a bed of Brown Rice and topped off with cheese<br /><br />Oh and its Kosher (D)<br /><br />only problem i have is finding it<br />and i like it so much i end up eating the whole 20-ounce can with the rice
1;"""My family and I use this product to enhance many meals.  They love the chili especially with lima beans and the color is a wonderful blend.  We used to drive about 25 miles for this product and the Worthington Link"
1;"""I love this product and have been using it for many years now. It makes a perfect yogurt every time. I use the Yogourmet incubator too - a gift from my mother when I got married 12 years ago. The gift that keeps on giving is always the best! I have tried all of the Yogourmet freeze dried starters with fantastic success. The Yogourmet Casei Bifidus Acidophilus Probiotic Yogurt Starter"
1;"""In one of the reviews of the Yogourmet incubator someone wished for a yogurt maker that was more like a toaster.  They wanted to put the milk in and take yogurt out.  This can almost be done with the Yogourmet Machine and the CBA culture.  Here's how.  Purchase two quart boxes of Organic Valley Whole shelf stable milk.  You find these not in the Dairy case but out on store shelves.  Then purchase a package of Organic Valley Non-Fat dry milk.  Are you good with this so far?  The only tricky part is warming the shelf stable boxed milk up to 77�.  I took a big cooking pot and put it in the sink and set the two closed boxes of milk in the pan and filled it with 80� tap water.  Around a half hour later the milk was the right temperature.  I ran some scalding water into my Yogourmet batch container for a mini-sanitize and to warm it slightly.  Then I added the two boxes of shelf stable milk.  Into this I mixed around 3 ounces of powdered milk using a hand mixer.  Verify that your milk is the correct temperature and put 4 ounces of the milk into a cup and mix in the two packages of the CBA starter.  Now pour and stir this back into the batch container and put the container in the Yogourmet incubator and add sufficient 77� water around the batch container and plug in the unit.  In 12 hours you will have your yogurt the easy way.  No heating"
1;"""I have been making yogurt using the Yogourmet machine and this CBA starter since 2003.  It was very easy to make successful yogurt consistently so I never switched to any other products.  It is good for both non-fat and whole fat milk - although personally I prefer whole fat since it tastes original.  I use 1/2 to 2/3 of a small bag for each 1/2 gallon container of yogurt.  It always comes out right after 11 hours of  cooking  time. I will definitely recommend this product."""
1;I have been using store bought yogurt to make my yogurt. However I have found that Casei Bifidus Acidophilus Probiotic Yogurt is so much better than the store bought variety. The flavor is purely delightful. I like to eat it as soon as it is cooled off. My yogurt is now much thicker and tastier than it was with the store bought yogurt. There is another benefit. I have been trying to regulate my digestive system......have had a problem for years. I have taken probiotic supplements with absolutely no success. My system now is perfect.....thanks to the Probiotic Yogurt Starter.
1;I have been using this product for about 6 months. I have had consistently good results when making yogurt with this starter. I tried to make follow up batches with yogurt I had made previously and it just never was as good as using this starter every time. One of the big secrets I have found to good yogurt is making sure that you mix in the starter thoroughly. Definitely improves the consistency.
1;Excellent.  Probiotics a plus.  Makes delicious yogurt. Very easy to make yougurt without all the artificial additives.  I made my first batch and it turned out perfectly.  I used organic dry milk as well for a thicker yogurt.
1;"""We use this to make homemade yogurt in our <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DZ8S5U >Yogurt Maker</a> and it has given use excellent results every time.<br /><br />It dissolves easily in tepid milk and leaves no clumps"
1;"""Every chocolate manufacturer will have a chocolate that can go with every season and satisfy the taste buds of all generations. Well Lindt has this chocolate which tastes absolutely awesome and goes with any occassion. You can either get the milk chocolate or go for the assorted one which has dark and other cocoa variations of chocolates. There is a myth that Lindt has liquor in all of its chocolates which is not so - Most Lindt in USA will only have cocoa liquor. Dark chocolates with whisky and other liquor variants are normally available from European markets - I got it few days back - available in Amazon. An amazing chocolate that melts so much in your much and makes you go crazy over its taste. In my opinion"
1;The Lindt Lindor Truffles Milk Chocolate are the best. They are creamy in the middle with a harder outer shell. They melt in your mouth. They are to die for. They are much better than any other Truffles.
1;This is a wonderful candy we enjoy from time to time and a great gift. We purchased the 60 count box if individually wrapped morsels to share with friends this time of year. An extra surprise for Easter Baskets and candy dishes.
1;"""I'm really enjoying this tea.  I've ordered several different flavors from this company and so far all have been great.  This is a very flavorful orange spice black tea.  The tea comes in a resealable  zip-lock  type back"
1;I purchased this product for my Yorkie puppy (MiMi)who was 3 months old. She was very fuzzy and I went through several types of food for her from very expensive to cheap. This she loves and eats every last drop. She has also gained weight which we needed badly. Highly recommend.
1;The time for delivery was fast and I'm very satisfied with the price for this product especially the opportunity to subscribe and have this product sent to me at my chosen intervals.  It makes life a lot easier to know I don't have to worry about making this purchase and just having it automatically delivered as well as having the option to cancel and/or change the delivery time according to my needs.
1;"""My puppy is a very picky eater and when I found out Cesar had puppy food I had to try it cause I always said if I got a small dog I would want him to b a Cesar dog. This came and I love the fact that it comes in the little trays so it made it easy and neat to store. My puppy took one bite and has not looked back. I have tried to sneak him some of his old food and it is a no go. He just looks at me like don't even try it. My only mistake aw I didn't get the subscription of this"
1;Who ever came up with the idea to give the option to purchase this on a subscription is amazing. I am deployed right now so my mom is taking care of my two yorkies and her 3 yorkies. I feel like they were eating her out of house and home so I bought this for a monthly delivery(each purchase is 24 trays) for cheaper than wallmart pricing! She called me in tears because this showed up on her doorstep as a surprise (came over 2 weeks early amazing) so she doesnt have to worry about running around town buying dogfood all the time. I do not go by serving size listed on the packaging since we use it as a treat  usually its half a tray per dog and mixit with dry dog food and leftover rice!
1;"""I am type ONE Diabetic.  I dont have time for breakfast in the mornings so I grab this high protein drink and it is very tasty and good for you and I dont worry about my blood sugar as it is just enough of carbs"
1;I was first introduced to these mustards in Ireland.  They are amazing and I was happy to find them on Amazon.  My favorite of the three is the Irish Whiskey flavor.  The Guinness flavor is amazing as well.  A little pricey for the amount you get (7.2 oz) but they're so good it's worth the expense.  Highly recommended!!
1;"""Great for any kind of stuff toy.  Put your toy in the freezer after you've stuffed it to make it a little trickier for your dog to empty it.<br />I don't know that I'd use it with an overweight dog--lots of calories.  There is a reduced calorie version for Senior dogs"
1;"""My puppy didn't like going to his crate in the mornings and he would scream until he finally wore himself out.  Enter the kong stuff'n.  Ever since I started filling his kong up with this stuff in the mornings"
1;"""This is the perfect basket for a friend or co-worker.  I ordered it for a co-worker's birthday and was able to be there when she opened it.  All the items were really well packaged and beautifully presented.  I got to try a few items and everything was delicious (can you say chocolate peanut butter pretzel? yes please.)  Would absolutely order this basket again.  One more thing- usually you get a basket that you can't really use- this basket was great to have in the house for storage"
1;"""I have two 70 lb. dogs. One chews on anything but the other chews on almost nothing. Both will immediately attack this bone and have a ball chewing on it. The one dog usually ignores regular rawhide but I didn't have to wait and see with this"
1;My dog absolutely loves these and he is such a picky eater. I probably tried almost 6 different dog treats but I had to give them away to friends because he wouldn't touch them. These however he will chew up until they're gone. He also likes to hide them and save them for later. He doesn't however like the peanut butter ones.
1;My cairn terrier Daisy loves these basted bones. Having trouble<br />finding them in retail. I hope its not a sign that the product<br />is discontinued. She also likes the peanut butter basted flavor.
1;These patties are great for traveling and emergencies. My dogs are fed a homemade raw diet but I keep a bag or two of these on hand just in case. They also make a great occasional treat since the dogs love them.
1;I just got a case of these in the mail which I ordered on S&S a few days ago and I must say that are delicious.  I have tried the traditional cheddar puffs as well as spicy curls and I enjoyed both flavor so this is a nice combination of the two.  The flavor is just slightly spicy with a nice cheddar taste.  At 130 calories/serving and only .5 grams of saturated fat these are a great snack for anyone watching their intake.
1;"""Generally I hate sugarless gum because they always leave that terrible  sugary  aftertaste in your mouth but I buy them because I want to preserve my teeth and save calories at the same time. So I tried Orbit's Mint Mojito and wow I love this gum.  The taste is very clean"
1;"""I ordered the Bellagio hot chocolate for favors at my wedding.  I tried it ahead of time to make sure it was going to taste good.  It was well worth it.  I recieved many compliments from my guests on how much they liked it.  The price was perfect"
1;Every year for Christmas I have given my boyfriend different gourmet brands of hot chocolate as stocking stuffers. However three years ago I got Bellagio hot chocolate and that is the ONLY brand he wants. He especially loves the caramel praline and the chocolate truffle. They are smooth and wonderful in warm/hot milk! It's never an over whelming or under whelming flavor. Always delicious. Whether you are sipping it reading a book or having it with friends after a great meal. I highly recommend it!!!
1;"""This and a Maui Sweet Onion dressing are made by a small company in Kauai - Kauai Kookie [...] and they are great tasting salad dressings. We buy several bottles on our annual trip there and bring them back with us. This particular listing does not say how many bottles one is getting for $17.50"
1;My son loves this pasta!  He is on a GF/CF/SF diet so has limited food choices.  He used to grab the bag out of the pantry to ask for it.  Now I have added it to his picture cards so he can flip through the cards and ask for it.  He loves the texture and the shapes and colors are fun.  The rest of the family will eat it as well.  It has a great texture when cooked al-dente and when stored in the refrigerator does not get mushy.
1;First we tried Tinkyada rice pasta and we could eat it but it was mushy and soft. This brand tastes better too and holds up just like wheat pasta if you don't evercook it.  It is good reheated and can be eaten in cold dishes.  My son loves it.  The animal shapes are fun. I also like that it is organic and whole grain.
1;Funny thing is I dont like beans...or rather the texture of beans. I tried this yummy soup over 2 years ago and<br />it is so good I have a 8oz cup daily. The soup is puree'd with no bean texture. The black bean and mild to medium hot spice's and flavors ...with a hint of cilatro is a very satisfying soup. Think would make a great layer to the traditional 7 layer taco dip as well. Only suggestion is to slightly lower the sea salt content - although it is not nearly as high as most soups out there. Best soup ever!!
1;I love this soup!  I add extra cheese and crackers (both organic) and it fills me up!  I love all the flavors offered...especially this one and the Tomato Basil!  I buy by the case and really like it delivered to my door.
1;"""I was discouraged when this seasoning was discontinued by Nantucket Off-Shore.  I searched for it on many websites and finally found it on Amazon.com.  They only offered it in lots of six tins.  However"
1;I can't believe this product is out of stock!!! It is so delicious and easy-to-use! The best part is that it comes in a tin so its easy to scoop out the rub instead of having to shake it on and get everything gross. i hope they bring it back soon because i want to stock up on it :)
1;These kernels are fresh and H U G E!! We had a problem with the order being mis-routed by the carrier (not the fault of Gerbs) and Gerbs jumped in to not only correct it but to offer a tidy discount on my next order for my troubles.  These kernels are really nice oven roasted.  We love them and have found our preferred kernels!
1;I was looking for raw pumpkin seeds which are not processed in a facility/equipment dealing with eggs etc. GERBS is the right place to shop if you want seeds without any cross contamination.I also purchased the sunflower seed kernels from the same seller.
1;"""I've been buying this for some time. It's expensive but I only eat it once in a while. But now my teenage daughter has discovered it and I can hardly keep the pantry stocked. So I'm glad I thought to check on amazon. With Subscribe and Save it's cheaper than I ever find it in the store (and only one store in my area carries it).<br /><br />What a great food for a teenager to be eating! She makes a parfait with granola"
1;I ordered this tea on a lark and what a find!  It is a great product--perfect to make with water or as my son does with Soy Milk.  Fragrant and warm it soothes the soul on a cold night or after a trying day at the office.
1;I bought several different brands of Chai from Amazon to try and find the perfect latte mix.  This is by far my favorite and is the one brand that is almost gone in my cupboard while other packets of other brands still remain.
1;I purchased this Lemon Pepper seasoning in the past from Sam's Club as no one else has this brand. I am no longer a Sam's club customer so I conducted an online search for this seasoning because it is indeed the BEST Lemon Pepper seasoning out there. THANK YOU AMAZON!
1;"""I've been buying Great River organic flour for over a year now.  The multi-grain bread flour and the whole wheat bread flour come in cases of 5 pound bags.  This all purpose flour is one large 25 pound bag.  I have Tupperware containers to store it but you should be aware of that.<br /><br />I've been very pleased with all the Great River organic flours.  I am particularly happy with the price that Amazon has.  I have shopped around"
1;It taste great at a great price only problem it is one big bag that is not resealable so you will have to find a place to put it. I would say buy it because I will buy again. I use it for the first time last night to make pizza and it taste great and good for you.
1;"""What can I say..Amazon does it again...A huge amount of M&M's for a very small price.<br />What makes this a good deal as well is that they are all the individually wrapped M&M packages.<br />These are a great size for snacks"
1;i had to order another 2 42 ounce bags today. the others i purchased at amazon did not last very long unfortunately. they are fresh. they are in a nice quality resealable bag to keep them fresh. they are delicious. watch for the lowest price. i am very happy with the freshness and quality of this product. it looks fresh and it smells fresh. i have ordered the 42 ounce size multiple times so far and i have no complaints.
1;"""Obviously if you're reading this you've probably already had M&M's - so don't let that stop you from buying this package!  I love the size of this bag because it fills a candy dish that I have out completely with a few left over for me to eat up right away.  They last for a while - though not as long as they should - in my house"
1;"""I was tired of getting bags of assorted chocolate candy that always had a variety no one would eat.  I love that amazon was selling this product and it came in  bulk .  I won't run out of the office candy again!  I went ahead and bought all of the favorite brands so I can keep everyone happy."""
1;What can I say! I love peanuts M&M's. I love them more than the regular kinds. They're filling and tasty. I got one of those M&M gumball machines and filled it up with this. I just love them. Go M&M's!
1;"""Quaker Instant Oatmeal cooks up very quickly.  Add hot water and thats all.  Vary the amount of hot water to adjust the consistency.  I like the oatmeal a little thicker than  normal  so I put about a tablespoon less water into the mix.  It works great.  The consistency is the same time after time.  I really like the maple and brown sugar oatmeal.  It tastes great"
1;"""I am one of those people who believes that the predominant taste of any kind of oatmeal should be the oatmeal and not whatever the added flavoring might be.  This Quaker product has a subtle aroma of maple and a hint of sweetness that enhances rather than overwhelms the oatmeal.  I did not find it at all artificial and there was no strange after taste.  My preference is always for longer cooking oats but busy mornings are not always conducive.  The consistency seems better when cooked in the microwave as opposed to pouring boiling water.  For a quick and healthy breakfast or snack"
1;"""I love Quaker oatmeal and this is by far my favorite flavor.  I am a sweet food junkie and this meets my need for some sweetness without being overly sweet.  Plus it is done in two minutes in the microwave.  Typically I used skim milk and water mixed together to make it"
1;My son loves Maple Brown Sugar Cream of Wheat so when I was offered to try the Quaker Maple Brown Sugar Oatmeal I jumped at the chance to offer him something different.  It was a huge hit!  It was super easy to prepare.  I put the oatmeal in a bowl with 2/3 cup of milk (he won't drink milk so this is one of the only ways we get it into him) and put it in the microwave for one minute and he ate it up almost as quick as it was made!<br /><br />Great price for this box of instant oatmeal too - if you do the subscribe and save you can save even more and cancel or change your shipment at anytime!
1;"""This is such a terrific product.  It's so easy. Pop it in the microwave and since we live on the run it is a great breakfast.  The maple brown sugar flavor is really tasty.  My son likes the apples and cinnamon too"
1;This has always been my favorite flavor oatmeal. Who among us can resist maple and brown sugar. The taste is sweet but not overpowering. My only complaint is that it is hard to know how much water to add. I always mess that part up.
1;"""I often wonder if I am the only person in the world who cannot stand microwave popcorn. Give me real corn and a little oil and I am pretty happy. Then I discovered this popcorn at a kitchen store in my local outlet. Then they went out of business and I lost my awesome popcorn connection... until now.<br /><br />Wabash Valley Farms is the best popcorn you can get outside of your local multi-plex (though I really like target popcorn too). You don't need the whirly popper as indicated on the package instructions - I always cook it on the stovetop in a large covered pot"
1;"""I got this stuff as a gift one year and left the box sitting on the shelf for several months. I decided one day while watching a movie to give it a try. Wow! What had I been missing? This is absolutely the best popcorn money can buy for your home.<br /><br />Now that we've tried it around the house"
1;We have really enjoyed the old time taste of this popcorn. I made a mistake and ordered two boxes but now am glad I did. Will probably have to order more sooner than expected. Thanks for the quality product--
1;"""I'm a huge fan of using coconut oil (check out <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049 >The Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil)</a> The Coconut Oil Miracle for more info on the health BENEFITS of using this oil over other processed junk. I was thrilled to see they used coconut oil for this product (side note"
1;I like this one for a desert coffee makes a great irish coffee with a nuty flavor and is great for difrent treats and concotions that you want fresh ground coffee and the nuty flavor with other things added  a nice desert complement with cheese cake.
1;"""I initially bought this at the grocery store on a lark because it sounded good. Imagine my surprise when it actually tasted as good as it sounds! I was even more thrilled to find it at Amazon at a great savings. Very flavorful and full of antioxidants"
1;"""This candy is quite good. I know it has to be sent cold but let it get down to room temperature and the taste and texture is quite amazing. The only issue I had with it is that since it's a pound or two in a single bag"
1;"""I found this grape lace licorice to be exactly what I was looking for. I have had different licorice at state firs but it was too chewy. This product is perfect. I will be ordering more in the near future. Can't wait to get the black lace licorice for comparison.Stephen from Western Mass"
1;I love this product (Ojai Lemonaise) and have been using it for years.  My family loves this product.  I use it to make tuna salad and chicken salad sandwiches.  Or anything I would use plain ol' mayo for.  Our favorite is to mix it in with a little melted butter for artichoke dipping. Yummy!  The only thing I hate is having to order it and have it shipped.
1;Just read the ingredient list. I haven't found another mayonnaise that compares to this both in taste and in quality. (I'm talking about the regular lemon mayo - the herb mayo and the light version aren't as good though...)
1;"""Dagoba (pronounced duh GO buh) Dark is the best chocolate I've ever tried.<br />A previous reviewer said they threw this chocolate out because of it's  artificial taste . Some people are so used to Tootsie Rolls and Ho-Ho's that they honestly have no idea what chocolate tastes like.<br />As my gramma used to say"
1;"""I purchased seven (7) varieties of the Organix organic dog food from my local whole foods market for $2.79-2.99 plus $2.31 tax = $37.79--12-12.7 oz cans.<br /><br />There are two types of Organix organic dog food grain-free"
1;I'm just hook on these great tasting beef sticks. I bring them to work and have all my coworkers hooked on them as well to the point where they pay me but buy them some. and for the cost of $0.40 ea its cheaper than hitting the snack machine.
1;"""Delicious snack food.  They didn't last a month at my house.  The kids love them and they're better for them than candy snacks. It took awhile during the holidays to get the order through but they were received in good order.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for an alternative"
1;I like this because I can add some sour without adding a lemon or lime flavor.<br /><br />If you can imagine tasting something which has the tart flavor of lime juice without any citrus flavor (to me anyway) this is what you get.<br /><br />Also has a natural sugar cane kind of sweetness to it.<br /><br />hint: i sometimes put a dab on my finger and taste it just for fun.. it's a nice candied flavor!
1;I got this for my mom who does not like strong coffee.  Paramount Rwanda Coffee is great.  Depending on how much water you use you can get a cup of coffee that satisfies the palate of a strong coffee drinker as well as that of someone who prefers a milder blend.  If you're looking for a flexible grind this coffee certainly fits the cup 
1;"""I love split pea soup and these peas are so fresh and cook up so well.  Can you buy cheaper split peas?  Of course you can but they likely weren't grown in the US and are probably a couple of years old.  These peas are far superior to the bag of peas in the grocery store.  These are grown in Washington"
1;"""These are delicious peas. I made about 6 crock pots of pea soup before the bag was finished. I hardly had to add any spices for it to taste delicious. Just some natural sea salt and a little brags amino acids. Plus I put in a few garlic cloves and it was so heart warming soup. Usually"
1;"""I love making pea soups - all kinds.  I received these peas a couple of days ago from Amazon and made my first batch of curry pea soup today.  These peas are some of the cleanest and of the highest quality I've ever purchased.  I always rinse and sort me legumes before I cook them and usually find something to sort out.  Not with these.  They where all beautiful and well formed with no trace of dirt"
1;I got a box of these little morsels from a girl scout back in May and was craving them so hard I caved and bought this box from Amazon. The box got rather banged up in shipping but the cookies were unharmed and positively amazing. Not stale or moisture damaged at all.<br /><br />The whole box lasted about 15 minutes.
1;This creamer is very rich and creamy.  It is convenient and does not have to be refrigerated.  We used powered French Vanilla creamer and had to be make special trips to the store because we were always running out.  A bottle of the concentrated creamer lasts longer and tastes better.  The flavor reminds you of sweet condensed milk.  Someone in a previous review said you cannot take the pump off once it is put on. The manufacturer must have changed this because it now just unscrews so you can clean the pump if necessary and also get the last drops that won't pump out.  Even though the 2 bottles seem costly it has definitely saved us money.  Amazon is the only place I have been able to find this creamer.  It now a staple in our pantry.
1;This creamer goes well with my coffee after having it once I could<br />not stop buying it I think it is my favorite it does not need to be<br />cooled it compliments your coffee in a way that make it taste like a  5.00<br />dollar cup I use it with my k-cup maker you can not go wrong with this creamer!
1;"""The coffee at my office is so bad - I didn't know a coffeemaker could output such disgusting sludge.  2 pumps of the Coffee-Mate concentrate and it is a totally different story.  I was initially skeptical about the no refrigeration"
1;"""Absolutely our dogs very favorite treats. They get excited just seeing the packaging. The fact that they are American made and first quality is importnat to us. Unlike other chew sticks the dogs eat these in their entirety. Never any left over. However"
1;- Tastes fresh and has a hint of hazelnut<br />- I had hazelnut coffee mate to help the taste<br />- 24 count comes in a box with an easy open cutout<br />- Green Mountain is generally what I buy in terms of K-cups and they haven't disappointed me yet.
1;"""Highly recommend this coffee! I just purchased it a week ago and bout to place another order because I love it so much! I haven't finished my first order of it yet but I want to make sure I don't run out lol. It's a smooth"
1;"""I also purchased Belgian Pearl Sugar to make Belgian waffles.  My goal was to imitate the Belgian waffles by Julian's Recipe.  I experimented with different recipes and ingredients but nothing was quite right until I tried this pearl sugar.  It's the key ingredient not just for taste for for texture.  It caramelizes during the cooking process"
1;We fell in love with Gaufre Liege during our first trip to Belgium. Since then we have had to wait until a subsequent trip or until family members could send us some pearled sugar. Now we have enough to make our favorite Gaufre here at home. Not too often since they are very rich but often enough to sate that craving.
1;"""The whole family loves this fajita marinade. Friends request it. The granddaughter forewarned her husband that he would be eating steak like he had never before tasted. Just put some Fabulosa on the steak"
1;Very satisfied.  It was delivered earlier than expected.  I bought this so my elderly mother wouldn't have to mess with loose coffee grounds.  She loves the convenience and the taste.  I will be ordering more.
1;I have tried many brands of bottled water and this is certainly my favorite.  It has a clean and pure taste and I will continue to buy it.  Destiny Deep Sea Water is quite amazing.  I recommend it to all.
1;Besides tasting great. This water has minerals that are missing in other waters and many of the foods that we consume that are grown in mineral depleted soils. You can feel the difference when you drink Destiny in how you feel hydrated.<br /><br />Thanks Destiny
1;You have to really search for good deals on tea and this tea is great fro the price.  Some tea on Amazon is almost a $1/cup! this is the same price as the K-cup coffee and some of the herbal varieties have low or no caffine which is a good option for my pregant wife that used to have the after dinner coffe with me.
1;"""This tea is a must for people who like a flavored tea.  It has enough spice to taste but not overpowering.  It works quickly and easily in my Keurig K-Cup coffee maker.  With a couple of ice cubes it makes a delicious ice tea as well.  I have been buying this brand for several years"
1;This tea is a wonderful blend of flavor and a scent that soothes the soul. Hopefully the manufacturing will not cease after the holidays are over. I'm not sure why this tea is so difficult to find but very happy Amazon keeps their shelves stocked.
1;I have a friend and antique shop owner who I normally visit weekly and like others I stop by even if I know I am not going to purchase a thing solely for this coffee. With the holidays coming around I became so busy I was unable to get my fix so I broke down and bought a machine for my home that was approximately $230.00 here on Amazon. I am addicted to both the Breville machine and this amazing blended tea. It is not overly sweet or artificial tasting. It is the BEST!
1;I have tried most of the KCup coffees. After about a year I have decided that my fav is Newman's Own. It is a bit more expensive but I find good deals on Amazon. I have a horrible day if I have run out of this coffee and have to settle for something else.
1;"""The one downside to the single serve coffee maker is that you cannot make your coffee stronger/weaker. Well I found that with this blend of coffee it gets much more bold than other brands. I like my coffee bold and this one is perfect for me.  I do wish that these single serving size cups were cheaper but other than that this product is excellent"
1;"""Here's a great bean dish that's a break from the ubiquitous canned bean products and yet not too exotic for those who cling to traditional American fare. The beans are firm and the sauce is thick and zesty with just a little bite to it. One package amounts to a side dish for two"
1;"""I have NEVER been disappointed with Tinkyada gluten free pastas.  WE have tried several varieties and I have loved the performance of all of them.  (The lasagna noodles are the most difficult but that is not what this review is about.)<br /><br />I live at about 5000 feet above sea level and I cook the noodles in boiling water for the amount of time listed on the package.  I always set a timer and do not rely on  trying it  like I used to with semolina pastas.  When the timer goes off test the pasta and set timer for another minute if needed.  I never have to cook longer than the time listed on the bag.  The pasta holds shape perfectly and is an awesome addition to our gluten free pantry.  I love the gluten free variety offered by Tinkyada and the amazing prices offered on amazon.com!"""
1;This product is great!  I was skeptical because I had never tried anything similar but I am sold on it now.  I recently went on a flourless diet and thought I was done with pasta for life but when someone recommended I try your product I decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did.  I bought the Tinkyada Brown Rice Fusilli packages and have shared with friends.  I am anxious to try more varieties and make some old familiar recipes with a pasta that works on my particular diet plan.  I used the quick and easy cooking method and it worked perfectly.
1;"""The coffee is strong and potent and stands up to its promises.<br /><br />That is if you can get it out of he coffee maker.  Half of the cups had broken seals and dripped grounds into the cup.  I saw that on the reviews before I ordered"
1;Really like this coffee. It's very bold and very smooth - not harsh or bitter at all. I'm not sure how much of an extra boost the ginseng and guarana actually gives you but it can't hurt. Will buy again.
1;"""I just love this coffee. It tastes great and it gives a little extra boost than most coffees. The price is not too bad but surely beats the price of  wake-up call  brand. I highly recommend you try it!"""
1;I love this coffee! I just need one cup now to wake me up in the morning and I have found that regular coffee just doesn't do it for me anymore. I don't feel jittery either. It is strong tasting but I like the taste of coffee so I don't mind that.
1;I have been been drinking aloe drinks for years. This is the best flavor and freshest aloe drink out there. I've tried many brands in different Asian markets. I recommend everyone try this. I bought this flavor 3 times already.
1;I found this refreshing drink while traveling to Big Island Hawaii.. the taste and hydration is extremely addictive! I subscribe to a case to supplement my habits and help quench my pregnant clients' thirst as well. Bits of aloe are so soothing. The slightly sweet and tart flavor of magosteen and mango really adds to the quenching palate. A long term fan!
1;i tried this at the beginning of the summer after a long bike ride. it was so refreshing and amazing.I went out on a limb when i bought this hoping it may be good.I am so glad i did because this stuff is AMAZING! Its healthy! Delicious! and good for your skin! :) alo is packed with vitamins and other natural minerals to deliver the best drink you will ever try. i buy them at my local grocery store and have probably bought over 75 over the summer . definitely worth a try:)
1;"""I've tried other aloe drinks before but they were all too sweet.  I came across this today in a health food store and decided to try it out because it's all natural.  You can definitely taste the difference with this drink.  It's natural"
1;I just got this today and put one in the freezer so I could drink it ASAP.  OMG.............I was a little leary about it but it is WONDERFUL!!!  Some people don't like the little pieces in the drink but I love them.  I am amazed at the great taste.  There are a few too many calories (70) in it for me so I may just add a little to my vitamin water that I normally drink.  I am  enjoying a bottle now and it is very refreshing!!
1;"""I had nearly given up on my dogs learning how to use this machine.  I had seen so many dogs on youtube and people saying they figured it out in 5 minutes...I was thinking that my dogs were NEVER going to figure it out! They would scratch and scratch on it and just could not seem to reach up and hit the lever.  I would get so frustrated watching them that I would end up pressing the lever for them.  I think they had me trained! Finally"
1;This is our second machine. Both this dog and our previous dog love it. It's easy to train them and they enjoy accessing their treats. Wrigley takes laundry to the hamper and then is rewarded by clicking her treat machine. Our friends are amused by her ability to know when she can and cannot retrieve her reward. It's fun!
1;I bought these for my girlfriend on her birthday along with some flowers and she loved them.  She liked them so much that I had to get her another order when she was done!  I also liked that they had the option to pack with ice packs because I ordered in the summer and didn't want them to be melted when they arrived.  I am very happy with the product... as is my lovely lady :)
1;These are absolutely wonderful! I wanted to try something in my Keurig other than coffee so we gave these a try. Both my 14 year old daughter and I LOVE them. I will be ordering more and keeping my pantry stocked!!!
1;"""I've been acquainted with Black Jewell popcorn since 1984. It is superior in a variety of ways. The  crunch factor  makes it preferable to  airy  popcorn. The absence of most of the hulls after popping also makes it a pleasure to eat.<br /><br />Most all the kernels pop thus adding both value and eliminating waste.<br /><br />But the MAIN reason I buy Black Jewell popcorn is that it just has that GREAT taste! Don't wait to enjoy Black Jewell"
1;"""My family has always loved Black Jewel but it is hard to find in our area for some reason.  We started out using the old fashioned bagged pop corn and using a covered skillet on the stove but we like the microwave type too.  If you try it"
1;"""The title of this review says it all.  This popcorn is the best popcorn that we've eaten and is worth the extra money if you enjoy good popcorn.  Bonus is that it is supposed to be better for you than  white  kernel popcorn."""
1;"""I was introduced to this product about 8 years ago by a friend and it has been the ONLY popcorn in my house ever since.  I am unable to get it consistantly in my  friendly  neighborhood grocery store so I chose to buy it on line where I can get two cases if I want.<br />Thank you Black Jewell.<br /><br />Popcorn Lover but only this one"
1;This tahini is one of the best brands I've used...it mixes easily with the spices and lemon juice that makes a base for many of my sauces.  I particularly like that it is organic and in a (reusable) glass jar.
1;"""I am always amazed at how well the coffees taste with the K-cups.  I am always afraid they will taste instant but do not.  With the tea it was the same.  I was hesitant to try them out for fear they would taste  different "
1;I'm not really a tea drinker but my husband is and he loves this tea. He drinks several cups a day and can't do without it. So on his behalf I'm recommending it.<br /><br />I did taste it and went yuck but I'm not a tea lover. In fact I hate tea so disregard my comments and just go on my hubby's recommendation.
1;"""I love wasabi peas and have ordered different brands and have bought every type imaginable off the grocery store shelves.  The peas from JR Mushrooms & Specialties are the best I've had to date.<br /><br />I like my wasabi peas to have a little kick"
1;"""This snack is wonderful and very addicting. I've just reordered the 5# bag today. It's a great snack and the fact that it's low fat is a big plus. We love the spicy flavor of the wasabi. The cost beats that of our local supermarket by about 10 to 1.<br />As an aside"
1;I have bought a bunch of different brands and these are on par with the best of them.  The price is great and probably the best deal you will find.  I seperated into smaller zip lock bags and put in freezer to keep fresh until I take them out to travel with as a snack.  Very pleased.
1;"""I first sampled this bar on a long drive from Albuquerque to El Paso.  It was the only thing I'd eaten since breakfast and it kept me going.  I then ordered a carton from Amazon and was impressed by the crunchiness and the good flavor from the assorted nuts packed in there.  If you've never tried this product"
1;"""I have been enjoying these for years.  I was delighted to find out I could get them at a discount and on a subscription basis from Amazon.  What more could a customer want?  These nuts are very nutritious and the best part is that it is not too sweet.  This works as a candy bar"
1;These bars are delicious and full of protein from walnuts and almonds that are alleged to be protective against cancer.<br />What a great use of candy: to give voice to MODERATES in the Middle East.<br />This is a company worthy of our support.
1;"""I can't even begin to say how delicious this mousse mix is.  We've tried many different ones and this is the best.  It reminds me of the Chocolate Budino from Bertucci's.  The dark chocolate makes it nice and rich without being overly sweet.  It has real chocolate chunks in the mix that melt in the microwave - I think having the real chocolate makes the difference.<br /><br />So easy to make - just put the mix with some whipping cream in the microwave"
1;I've loved Peppermint patties since I was kid. There's no doubt that York Peppermint Patties are the best. This large container will satisfy my sweet tooth for quite awhile as well as any one else fortunate enough to discover them.
1;York Peppermint Patties are a wonderful treat to have around.  They store well in the freezer and are delicious frozen or warmed up a bit.  Having a whole box delivered is sinfully wonderful!  Yum Yum!
1;I ordered this item because it said i could have it with free shipping because it was over $25.00. I got a notice that it would be sent and the shipping was $9.00.  This is not good i do not want to pay shipping.
1;I seem to receive these dental chews at just the right time.  I'm lost without them because my picky Chihuahua doesn't like anything but these.  Very quick service ordering these online and a great price with the s/h charges!  Thank you.
1;"""I have used Petrodex dental chews for many years now. I have 3 shihzhu-poodle mixed breed dogs each about 15-18 lbs. I have tried various other products before staying with this one:<br /><br />Greenies---made them intermittently vomit green particles almost pea soup or gazpacho.<br /><br />Merrick bull twists---the dogs loved them"
1;"""I first had sunflower oil when I was in Germany 2 years ago when my roommate at the time made me potatoes and drizzled a little oil over. Since then I had been looking for sunflower oil in markets but to no success. I finally decided to buy it online and it's just as I remember it. So delicious"
1;"""I purchased this tea because I have trouble holding my urine due to an illness. I had read somewhere that cornsilk tea was good for people with trouble in that area and I can say that it is true.  I can go to the bathroom with a peace of mind.  This tea is also good for edema"
1;I'm an 82-year-old male with a swollen prostate.  At night I was getting up every two hour to urinate.  This cornsilk tea cut my trips to the bathroom in half.  For me it was not enough by itself and I eventually started taking Avodart to shrink the prostate.  But I have found cornsilk tea helpful for the prostate.
1;I use this vanilla when making specific colors and I don't want to worry about having the dark brown pure vanilla tinting the frosting. Just wish I could get bigger jars or several together for less! I use so much!
1;It works as it should. It gives the flavor without adding any Color to the icing. I made black forest cake and put it on the whip cream icing. Tastes great! Be aware that it is a synthetic stuff. Real vanilla is brown Color.
1;"""We LOVE this product!!! Myself and three children have multiple food allergies and this mix is actually something everyone can and will eat (very rare). I make everything out of it from pizza crust to a loaf of bread to hamburger buns"
1;"""I was diagnosed with a severe gluten intolerance back in January. The main thing I really missed was bread products and all the bread mixes/loaves I read about were just ok and very over priced so I never tried them. I saw someone rave about this bread mix and since it was at one my local grocery stores at a cheap price I decided to try it. It was amazing and tasted like  normal  bread. It doesn't rise if you're making a bread loaf due to the mix having no yeast but I've made pizza crust"
1;"""Well what a surprise!  This stuff is really quite easy and good.  I used my vitamix to make the dough and it was a bit too much for it (sticky) - unfortunately hand blended is easier on kitchen equipment.  But you don't have to worry about handling the dough too much.  The thinner the end product the better it cooks inside. My current fav is a mini french bread loaf.  Crispy outside and slightly 'holey' inside. I made cheese bread sticks in with the plain mix and kneeding shredded cheese into it.  There is a slight odd"
1;"""These are inexpensive great treats. I bought them at Walmart several times and Walmart is always sold out because they are a great deal. I decided to go to the web to find them. The 18 ounce bag is actually 72 small bones. The picture says 7"
1;I have extreme eczema on my hands for two years now. I started using this coconut oil and eczema has completely resolved. The seller sent me a hand written note thanking me for my purchase.  If I could get to Hawaii I would look them up. What a blessing and truly wonderful experience with this seller.
1;Ive tried other scented coconut oils as opposed to natural edible versions to remind me of the beaches of Hawaii.. and this truly has the closest scent to me.<br />Hydrating and just a little bit mixed with water after a shower. Super replenishing!
1;"""I have been drinking Kava Coffee for 10 years and lately it has been difficult to find a store selling it.  I am excited andextremely pleased that I found it at Amazon.com and highly recommend this product to anyone who enjoys acid free coffee"
1;"""I got this set for my husband for part of his Christmas present and he loved it.  He didn't know that Dave's Insanity wasn't the hottest he could get until now - he immediately opened the Ultimate and started  practicing  eating it on crackers until it wouldn't make him sweat so he could embarrass his brother by making him sick with it when we went home for the holidays.  Next year I'm getting the bloody mary mix as a stocking stuffer"
1;This is a great product. It comes in a nice selection with all levels of extreme heat represented. My hubby likes to get others to try it who think they can handle it. Others always comment the it is hot but it also has great flavor. We like things hot but they also need to taste good!! This variety pack does not disappoint.
1;While living for a month in Scotland in a self catering we had settled into this tea from the Co-Op as our favorite. When we returned to the states we put away our coffee machine and went with pots of tea for breakfast. Great stuff! The longer you steep it the fuller the flavor ... max about 8 minutes. Brought home 4 boxes in our suitcases. The tea was so good we donated clothes to the local charity to make room for it. When we got back to the states and ran out we replinished our supply with Amazon ... thanks for being so global Amazon! :-) Cheers!
1;"""We had this tea in the UK while visiting some friends and vacationing.  We asked what type of tea they were using since it was so good.  We bought some Twinnings Everyday tea and brought it back to the states with us.  After running out in a few months we were desperate"
1;"""When my wife unwrapped the new saffron package from SimplyBeautiful and opened the the little plastic pouch holding the 1 ounce of delicate deep red threads of saffron the fragrance emitting from it delighted both of us. We have been using saffron for several years in a variety of dishes"
1;"""I know my saffron. I have tried different brands from different places. I think this is one of the best I have tried. I thought it was a good price for the quantity considering the fact that saffron is the most expensive spice out there. I also like the tin"
1;"""I have been buying saffron from them since the past three years and they have never failed me. Have ordered like 8 of these 1 ounce tins for family and they keep asking for more.<br />The quality of the saffron is fantastic. You can tell by the smell. It is a little pricey"
1;I was diagnosed this year and have experienced the learning curves of eating gluten free. We had several family favorites that I pretty much ruined with the gluten free bread crumbs available from my local Sprouts and Whole Foods. Bought these from other reviews I read online. These are  beyond wonderful!! You will not be sorry with your purchase.
1;I like the size & Angel loves the taste!  She likes to eat when we do & the Itty Bitty Bones satisfy her participation without affecting her appetite at her regular mealtime.  I LOVE knowing the products are safe and USA made.  Have just subscribed to monthly deliveries of this product.
1;"""I've tried just about every flavor out there that i can find of Izze Sparkling soda and I've loved every sip of it. Izze is a wonderful combination of juice and sparkling water. The blackberry flavor is a blend of grape"
1;"""*****<br />This Izze Sparkling Blackberry Soda isn't exactly a soda and isn't a really a juice---it's a healthy alternative drink that's a bit of a combination of the two. It contains a lovely medley of healthy juices without sweeteners except for the actual juice concentrate. For fizz and refreshment it includes 30% sparkling water.<br /><br />The juices it contains are: white grape juice"
1;"""This is the best drink I've ever drunk in my life. The only problem I have with this is the product hasn't been given the  go-ahead  to be sold worldwide by the Pepsi Company.<br /><br />I don't know if I'd get the pear version of this product"
1;It almost has a chocolate aftertaste - and it is nice! I'm on my second bag (actually bought a single bag to try and then a multi-bag purchase).  Now this isn't a french roast but it is fairly dark and the taste is beyond most. Try a single bag and take it from there._steve
1;I have not seen this in stores for years and ran across it on Amazon just last week. I am diabetic and usually make my own soups but sometimes its nice to just open a can and enjoy. This is pretty low in carbs and I was thrilled! I ordered two cases and hope Amazon keeps getting it in. The flavor is great and you can also use this with lc noodles or over chicken etc. Yum!
1;This is one of my favorite quick easy meals for the kids (and myself. My favorite part is that it is gluten free! I leave this soup and a bag of GF tortilla chips with a babysitter even- its that easy!
1;I have told any number of people when I can't find something I immediately go to Amazon and voila there it is and most times at the best price also!  With this particular item had it in California where it was readily available here on East coast not at all.  Found it once and never again and since it was super market item asked for it to be ordered only to be told if it's not in the wharehouse we don't open 'new' orders.<br />Just on a lark checked here and here it is.  Ordered a case.<br />Love it best canned soup I ever tasted-why because it parallels the taste of the homemade cream of turkey soup my mom used to make.  What a find!
1;"""IN A NUTSHELL: Recently I have begun using this brand exclusively. Here's why.<br /><br /> COLAVITA - EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL  has an impressive list of credentials that clearly set it apart from other makers of Olive Oil. This particular product boasts the following:<br /><br />-----*- Certification from the  I.S.O.  -  International Standardization Organization <br /><br />-----*-  Certified Authentic Product of Italy "
1;We have used Colavita olive oil now for many years and have always found it to be an excellent oil for use in cooking and on salads. It has an nice flavor and is far superior to other oils we have tried in the past. I am looking at a partially used bottle as I write this review
1;This product is a real bargain and better than the one from the grocery store.  We were paying $4.25 for a small bottle and this sure is less expensive and tasts better than the other brand. I would recommend it highly.
1;Very pleased to find this product.  Fantastic purchase for anyone who uses pumpkin pie or any other spice in large quantities.  It was reasonably priced and Marshall's Creek Spices is on my list for future orders of their products via Amazon.  Will definitely order again when needed.
1;I have ordered these peanuts several times so far.  I cannot find them anywhere in the local grocery stores or specialty food shops in my area so thank you Amazon!<br /><br />The peanuts arrive carefully packed and fresh.  I will continue to order these peanuts for as long as I can.<br /><br />Anyone who is a fan of sushi should enjoy these.
1;"""After reading reviews I purchased the 2.5 oz. pkgs. of Great Northern Popcorn. It popped up nicely.  Very few  old maids . I did notice that a lot of moisture gathered on the sides of our popper (the Waring WPM25 model) during the popping process so I pulled the tray of popcorn out promptly. I could see if you left it in the machine"
1;This is the best tasting popcorn that I have ever tried.  I personally believe it is better than the popcorn served at most theaters.  The packages are easy to use and provide a no-mess solution to popcorn machines.
1;Golden niblets of heaven<br />Saliferous manna from the gods<br />Crackling crispy bites<br />Who would resist your wispy orbs?<br />Your crags and craggles and wonderments<br />Perfection yielding only when all are devoured<br /><br />I look upon the unpopped kernels with pity<br />Knowing theirs was a destiny of the damned
1;"""My family loves the taste of the popcorn and our guest love the fact that I have a popcorn machine that I proudly display in our bar area of our home. When I say it taste better than movie popcorn is that when you couple our popcorn machine with a high quality popcorn product like Great Northern"
1;"""These packets are all you need to achieve the perfect movie theater popcorn experience!  If you love popcorn like we do look no further!  It's not to greasy and is a little on the salty side but it only makes you want to eat more!  To make"
1;I wanted to find the same popcorn used in bars & at the movie theater and THIS IS IT! This is the best tasting popcorn I have ever had! I have a kettle style corn popper and this is the only popcorn I'll ever buy again. I even popped the popcorn on the stove to see if it would taste the same and it did! This is the only popcorn you should buy!
1;"""I have used about 5 or 6 boxes (24 count) of this brand and have really liked the flavor and the the freshness in every order that I received. I have only tried one other brand and thought it was stale and did not like the flavor. For me it is not to salty in fact I add a little salt before I pop it. I use one or two a day and always have a bowl of popped corn out for my grand kids. When ever they come over they always head to the snack shack (a little stand alone cupboard)for a treat. We try to have healthy treats but I think the pop corn is probably more healthy than the granola bars"
1;Purchased this to use with a popcorn machine and while the machine had to be returned the popcorn itself is good. My kids loved it and thought the house smelled like the local movie theatre. Its easy to prepare and the taste is great. No extra butter or salt was needed it was perfect for our family. We just have to find a decent machine to use it with...until then we'll just use the stove.
1;I had tried to use grocery store oil and popcorn in my countertop popper but it always tasted stale and not a bit like movie theater popcorn.  Decided to try this for a party and it made a world of difference.  Tasted just like fresh popped corn at the theater.  The packs were easy to use.  Just cut across the top and dump all 3 packets into the heated popper.  I will definitely buy again.
1;"""Great popcorn.  My family and I love watching movies and eating popcorn.  We consume more popcorn during the fall and winter months.  We received this popcorn and quickly made our first batch.  Wow.......It was great.  We made the mistake of not mixing everything together (oil"
1;This is wonderful delicious just like movie popcorn.  It's salty so nothing extra needed but just the best made at home popcorn ever...I pop it in a dutch oven on my stove top..Can you imagine if it were popped in a popcorn machine?  It's just the best!
1;"""I bought this popcorn to use in my whirley pop and it pops up perfectly.  The taste is wonderful. I liked it so much I decided to have it shipped automatically.  If you want popcorn like they serve in the movie theater"
1;I've used cases of these popcorn portion packs and they are great.  The best value and ease of use in one package.  I use them in my home theater and we go through quite a bit of snacks and popcorn.  We have a Great Northern popcorn machine that has also worked flawlessly and was the best price anywhere on a good machine.
1;"""This stuff is great. I use it in my whirley pop and it makes perfect popcorn. Flavor is pretty darn close to movie theater. Everyone in my family loves this stuff. I do like a bit more salt on my popcorn but this can be a bit too salty even for me. I cut the salt pack open before the rest and take out the salt. I would say I use about half to 3/4 what comes in the pack. Then I cut the rest of the pack open and dump it all in. This is about the right amount of salt for me. The only problem is the salt is butter flavored so you loose a bit of flavor doing this. I'd say make a batch like normal first and then adjust the salt to taste if needed. That's an easy fix. I save the salt and then I use it for future popcorn making without the kit.<br /><br />If I can find some smaller sample packs to try of other brands"
1;So easy to make popcorn with these everything-in-on portion packs.  All you do is load your popcorn machine with the premeasured amount of popcorn & flavored oil and you are good to go.  Couldn't be any easier & tastes great too!
1;I bought these for an event where I had to have different people cooking a lot of popcorn quickly. All you have to do is dump in the ingredients and go. We didn't need any extra butter or salt and everyone commented on how tasty the popcorn was. Definitely worth the money!
1;I bought the pit popper and the popcorn and it is absolutely delicious.  The popcorn tastes like theatre popcorn. Huge hit at the campground!!!  I would certainly recommend to everyone.  The pit popper is well worth the money too.
1;We just ordered some of this popcorn with our new popcorn machine from discounttommy and its the best popcorn we've ever had hands down. Defiantly going to be getting some more when we get through these! -Jason
1;Hands down the best popcorn you can make at home. I am convinced that the 8 oz antique popcorn cart that i purchased has paid for itself 5 times over with the savings of staying home to watch movies and have fresh popcorn at an arms reach. I hope you guys stay in business for a long time!
1;The packets are easy to use with no mess. Very little left unpopped and has great flavor. Great Northern has become my one and only source. I order by the case. I have a great northern popcorn cart too. The grand kids love it. Highly recommend all Great northern products.
1;"""I Have been looking for the perfect popcorn pre-made pouches for a long time. This is by far the best and Discount Tommy is the fastest in shipping the popcorn to me. I can always count on them for freshness"
1;"""We use this popcorn in our popcorn popper (Roosevelt Popper from Discount Tommy) and it makes the best popcorn.  Everyone who comes over for movie night says it is the best popcorn they have ever had.  We tried some other kinds"
1;"""We purchased a popcorn machine for our media room which called for the 4oz. packs of popcorn. The machine was purchased at Sam's Club where the popcorn packs were not available. Not finding this in town"
1;"""I used the 4oz size which is just perfect for me and my wife.  My wife loves popcorn and can eat a whole large tub all by herself...but this 4 ozsize packet could easily feed 3-4 people for movie night and completely fills my Stir Crazy popper.  I dont melt the oil like some reviewers said to do since it arrived solid...I just pour all of the popcorn first spread out over my popper and then squeeze out little blobs of the oil here and there over the popcorn.  Worked perfectly and I had maybe 2 unpopped kernels.  The popcorn was very large and fuffy just like you get at the movies.  When the popcorn is done I sprinkle a little of the salt then shake the popcorn around"
1;"""I have a box of this popcorn and a box of Pop Weaver popcorn. No offense to Pop Weaver popcorn because I think it also tastes great. But I like the flavor of the Great American popcorn better. As for unpopped kernels"
1;" ""Santa  brought our family a  real  popcorn machine from Discount Tommy's a few years ago.  We have used it almost every weekend since then!  I had been concerned about the amount of microwaved popcorn my family was eating and thought this would be somewhat healthier.  We have really enjoyed the Great Northern Popcorn--all we have ever used in our machine.  The pre-packaged all-you-need ingredients are so convenient!  If we ever wear our machine out"
1;"""We've ordered Great Northern Popcorn from Discount Tommy for about a year now. The popcorn is for a machine we keep in our employee lunch room for  Popcorn Fridays .  The portion packs are great because anyone can just snip off the top and pour it into the kettle.  No measuring or mess to clean up afterwards.  And the balance of butter and salt is perfect (other brands can be too salty or too greasy).  We've tried other brands but the employees complained about the taste so we switched back to Great Northern and everyone is happy again. It tastes (and smells) just like the popcorn from your favorite movie theatre.  Yum!!"""
1;What a great product!  So simple to use plus all the flavor of the movie theater for a fraction of the cost.  Great when watching those football games on your big screen as well.  Popcorn - a great snack and this is the best of the best!
1;"""This popcorn has a good taste like the movies theaters at a reasonable price. The package contains all of the ingredients and instructions to a good eating and popping experience.<br />Although I didn't got through the whole case I bought"
1;"""I love popcorn so I have tried every name brand of popcorn in the store. I bought a Great Northern popcorn popper and tried the popcorn and I was hooked. It is very easy and simple to make. Every function I have at home"
1;I first found this company on ebay.  I purchased one of their poppers and popcorn.  Shipping was quick and the popcorn was awesome.  Love how simple to make the popcorn with all the fixings in the bag.  If someone is on a reduced sodium diet it is very simple to not allow some or all of the butter flavored salt to go into the hopper.  I've found just the oil has a great flavor too!<br /><br />Floyd
1;i bought the 8oz Roosevelt Popper originally. I tried local popcorn and other national brands of oil and popcorn but could not get that theater taste. I then ordered a case from Discount Tommy and found his to be the taste I was looking for. Shipping is fast and the cost is very reasonable. I strongly recommend this product.
1;This is the perfect product to get that movie-theater popcorn at home. Everything is in the package all you have to do is open it and put it in the popcorn popper and it makes really great popcorn. It makes movie night at home feel like you have gone to the theater.
1;"""I purchased this popcorn for my roosevelt popper purchased thru tommy's.The packets are so easy to use since there is no measuring.This is by far the best popcorn i have used so far taste as good as movie theatre popcorn"
1;"""If you love the taste of movie theater popcorn and dont want to wait in line... look no further then Great Northern Popcorn.  Its the favorite of our kids and all their friends every movie night.  We use the 4"
1;"""We use this popcorn in our Paducah Popper from Discount Tommy! It makes the best  Going to the Movies  popcorn. We bought the popper & popcorn for parties and it works out great!  We stick with what works"
1;"""This is great popcorn!  No extras needed. Just dump it all in and let the popper do the rest. This is as good if not better than the movies!!!!! I see bad reviews for unpopped corn but I have very few with  Great Northern Popcorn  in the Stir Crazy popper! The corn pops so big that the top of the popper rises up and spills some on the counter."""
1;"""I purchased this popcorn to use in my popcorn machine. It pops easily. It is very flavorful that every time we have a movie under the stars its the first thing the gets eaten up. Everyone in my family enjoys it. We no longer buy microwave popcorn. The package is easy to open and pour into the machine. The part I really enjoy is that it is all measure out so all I have to do is put it into the kettle. I don't have to stress out about making sure I have the right oil"
1;"""We have an in home cinema...so we have to have a floor standing popcorn maker.  When we have guest we like to make it a real even with  MOVIE  popcorn and Little Popper does just that.  I love the flavor and the convenience of the package that is premeasured for the perfect pop.  I do add just 1/2 of the salt while popping and the remaining salt I have placed in a shaker for those that like more.  If you are looking for that  MOVIE  butter flavor this is the one!"""
1;I have been hosting backyard movies every summer for the past 5 years and I love using this popcorn at the concession stand. It has the real movie theater taste and it makes plenty for our guests. great product and company!
1;"""I have had my stand up popcorn machine for years and I have been using the Great Northern pre measured packs. They are easy to use and the popcorn tastes great! My son loves to make the popcorn and with the simple easy to use pre-measured packs"
1;Great popcorn at a great price.<br /><br />I use the 8oz bags in my popcorn machine 8oz popper I bought from from Discount Tommy. The popper and the 8oz bags have been a<br />big hit with the family and the kids friends for every movie night and sporting event we watch.<br /><br />My 8oz popper creates enough popcorn for all the friends and they all love it.<br /><br />If you have a commercial style 8oz popper I would totally recommend these. The popcorn tastes delicious. I have bought 3 cases over the years and will be back to Discount Tommy when I need more.
1;I purchased a Roosevelt Popper from Discount Tommy and I have only used Great Northern Popcorn in the machine. The packs are very easy to use and the popcorn tastes great!  My family loves it. Movie night would not be the same without this popcorn.
1;Bought the popper about two years ago and have been enjoying the delicious fresh buttery salty (as I want) best popcorn ever.  love it and it's a staple snack in our house. Would never micorwave corn again.
1;This is the best popcorn around.  I use it for my rental business as it is so convienent for the customers to use.  All of my customers absolutely LOVE the popcorn and I've had repeat business because of it.  I would only stick with this brand as it doesn't get better than this!
1;"""I purchased popcorn from Discount Tommy twice now...The popcorn packets are great and easy to use in either a pan or in the popcorn maker I also purchased from Discount Tommy at an incredibly low purchase price...The popcorn is better than some of the popcorn at movie theatres"
1;We have purchased two 8oz poppers (red and Black and several cases of popcorn. We had an issue that we resolved quickly through customer service. They were fast and friendly to deal with. Great company!
1;"""We all love it. I have a  Man Cave  in my basement with a popcorn machine. All my friends and family love the popcorn I pop. I now use nothing but Great Northern. I also have a small machine in the main area of our house and use nothing but Great Northern in it as well. Great taste"
1;"""I never really cared for popcorn before...at least none of the  home  popcorn.  The only place I'd eat popcorn was at the theaters because the butter flavor was so good.  I purchase a kettle popper for our home and ran across a deal Great Northern Popcorn...... OMG it is GOOD!!  Just like the movies but way cheaper and I can enjoy it in the comfort of my own home!  YUMMY!!!"""
1;"""We have been using this product for over a year now and that should speak volumes because we are a popcorn loving bunch!  The convenience of having everything measured and ready to go at a minute's notice is great.  I have a popcorn machine in the media room and so we love to munch popcorn while watching movies.....we feel we are at a theater eating the  real deal .  I will continue to purchase even though it isn't the most figure friendly popcorn....taste outweighs the waist....tee-he."""
1;"""This stuff worked really well for a school fundraiser.  Everyone loved it and there were very few kernels left after it popped.  Others complained about the oil being solidified but that happens when it gets cold.  After we had it outside for a while it all liquified but it works fine either way"
1;"""I popped my first batch and I have to say this does taste pretty darn close to what you'd find at a movie theatre.  Everything seems to be measured well enough that you don't see any grease stains when using a popcorn bag but you still get that distinct taste and flavor.  The popcorn tasted fresh but there are no expiration dates or lot numbers anywhere on the packaging so I'm not sure how they can trace anything if there's a bad batch. They don't have any ISO 9001 markings so I'm assuming there is no quality oversight of these.<br /><br />I have zero real complaints about the popcorn or the taste"
1;I purchased this popcorn for my Nostalgia retro popcorn machine hoping that I would be able to produce movie theatre quality popcorn at home.  The seller describes this as the best popcorn available and I have to agree that it really lives up to the hype!  The popcorn comes out delicious every time-- the perfect balance of butteriness and salt.  I tried using popcorn kernels and all kinds of different oils before I bought this product.  I will never use anything other than this popcorn!  The only problem is that I have eaten 10 of 24 packages-- and I've only had it for two weeks!
1;"""The saltiness depends on how you prepare it.  When you pour the salt in with the oil and kernels and then pop the corn you can use the whole salt thing and it won't be salty at all.  If you only cook the kernels in the oil without the salt and then sprinkle the salt on to the popped corn last"
1;"""I received a popcorn maker for Christmas. It has a small drum (holding 1/4 cup unpopped corn). I have never used a machine like this and wasn't sure if this popcorn size would be too much for the drum. It was perfect. The flavor is great"
1;I love this popcorn. I bought my other 1/2 a small old fashioned popcorn maker for Christmas. I bought this popcorn and it is great. The flavor is wonderful and there is no measuring needed. It has already been done for you! Great value!
1;I am using these in my small popcorn machine. It does taste just like the movie theater popcorn. Very good and very easy to use. Just make sure you get the rite size portion packs. I got the 4 oz when I needed the 2 oz packages.
1;"""I can't say enough good stuff about this popcorn.  It is the best tasting popcorn I've ever had. I've ordered it twice (both times from Amazon) and have not been disappointed by it in any way.  After popping"
1;We received this popcorn as a gift along with the 8oz popper from the same manufacturer. I am completely pleased! I save the salt for after the corn is popped so I can flavor to taste.  It pops fast and tastes terrific!
1;"""I have been looking for  Movie Theater Popcorn  that you can make at home for a very long time.  I happened by chance on this product and I purchased it.  It is indeed the  Best Popcorn Ever .  Every kernel pops and the taste is fantastic.  I will be purchasing this popcorn only from now on."""
1;like is says that this is the best popcorn in the u.s.Eight Ounce Portion Packs (Case of 24)a it really is .the popcorn is the best because of the butter and there is no trans fat and no cholesterol. it is truely the best popcorn in the u.s.a or possible the best in the world.
1;THE PACKAGING IS GREAT AND IS THE PERFECT SIZE FOR THE POPPER WE GOT. THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET THE CONTENTS TO POUR INTO THE KETTLE PROPERLY WITHOUT MAKING A MESS. HAVE TO PUT IN A SEPERATE CONTAINER WITH A SPOUT. THE FLAVOR IS GREAT!!
1;"""I usually make my popcorn on the stove but when I got a popcorn machine I quickly noticed you can't use the same methods and decided to buy these packets.  The popcorn doesn't come out the same as when I make it on the stove but it is good nonetheless (a diff type of good) plus much less hassle.  I was worried when I read other reviews about the  stale  taste and oil...I didn't have any of that.  When the box came some of the oil was liquid and other packets were solid"
1;"""This popcorn tastes fantastic. I just bought this popcorn and an air popper and I'm never going back to microwave bags again.<br /><br />Just a warning to you all though ... I bought 6 oz packs to get more bang for my buck but man 6 oz of popcorn makes A LOT.  Between me and my roommate we were stuffed.  If you want to have movie night with your family though"
1;We love this popcorn for our popcorn machine...perfect portions and perfectly salted and 'buttered'.  Love that there is no traces of peanuts also so that our guests don't have to worry about peanut allergies.
1;Ever since we bought our popcorn machine two years ago we've used this popcorn. Originally we had thought we'd get our own oil and save money rather than use the pre-portioned packs. However we tried it once and could never go back. It's just so easy and delicious that it's worth any extra expense. We went on the auto-ship program to save some money. I highly recommend this popcorn. It's actually ruined us on movie theater popcorn since we actually prefer this.
1;I serve this popcorn to my guests and they can't get over how much taste it has. Not to much salt nor not to much oil. It tastes so fresh. It is always served as part of our appetizers when entertaining. We even have people that use the pool adjacent to our home yell at me to 'bring popcorn'. The free shipping is very nice. The discount for setting up automatic shipments is a nice perk. We have purchase at least 4 cases since we bought the Roosevelt popcorn maker and the cart. It is a nice addition to our family room.
1;"""This is the best tasting popcorn we've found for our stand popcorn popper.  We've tried a few others and this tastes the closest to movie theater type.  It pops well and tastes wonderful!  Works well on the stove top"
1;THIS IS MOVIE THEATHER QUALITY--HANDS DOWN!!! THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO MAKE POPCORN AT HOME. FAIL PROOF!!! I HALF THE AMOUNT OF SALT FOR MY TASTE--BUT SO EASY TO STORE AND MAKE. THE 8OZ WILL MAKE ABOUT 8+ SINGLE POPCORN BOXES FULL.  IF IT'S JUST FOR A COUPLE OF PEOPLE I WOULD BUY THE 4 OUNCE INSTEAD. NICE PRODUCT!!
1;A+  I bought this product to use with my new 4 0z. Popcorn machine.  The flavor is absolutely delicious!  I agree with the other reviews that I've read...it tasted just like theater popcorn!  There were a few old maids left that didn't pop but I will buy more when my supply runs out.
1;This popcorn is great. It tastes like movie popcorn or better. It's tender & has lots of flavor.  One bag makes alot of popcorn so it's great for movie night with your family. I bought this popcorn for a gift for my Husband for Christmas but I ended up giving it to him early. He is a big time popcorn eater. It is his favorite snack. The store bought types just don't measure up in flavor or tenderness. I have to buy him more for Christmas so I am definitely buying this popcorn again.<br />Sandra L
1;I just love the flavor of this product. It pops nearly all the cernals and has very little waste. It is the correct measurement of oil to popcorn and there is no oil left over after all the popcorn pops.<br />T. J. Mulhern
1;I have ordered this popcorn 3 times now.  It is just like being at the movies!  We don't get to go because we have small children so we make our home a theater.  This popcorn is absolutely the best!  I like it better than the movie popcorn!  Every pack is awesome!  People come over and can't believe how good it taste!  This is a must buy!!
1;I use this in my 6 quart Whirley pop maker.  The popcorn maker over flows with delicious popcorn every time.  Hardly any old maids!  I am a true convert now - I will only use these premeasured packets.
1;"""We have a floor standing popcorn machine and tried a few different products before getting this one.  We stopped looking when we got this!  It's the bomb!  We love it and buy it by the case.  It's the real deal"
1;"""I received a popcorn machine for my birthday and I have not been able to find the right combination to make popcorn that tastes like you get at the movies.  The local convienence store always has great popcorn and I happened to notice they use this.  I just went through a case in less than a month! It is good stuff!  The 8 oz size is a bit much for my family of four"
1;"""I ordered this to use with my Whirley Pop and I absolutely love it.<br /><br />This pouch has a bit more stuff in it than the standard single serve pouch from Wabash Farms (8oz vs 5.5oz) so I expected some unpopped kernels and indeed ended up with a few dozen.<br /><br />I have only popped one pouch so far so I plan to leave it on a few more seconds next time around"
1;"""This makes Carnival/Theater style popcorn and the taste and smell makes you feel you are at the Movies. I too like it because it is easy to use. All the Ingredients are there in a small package...popcorn"
1;Looked all over for this popcorn after receiving my Waring Pro 2oz. popcorn maker for my kids for christmas. Could not find any pre-packaged popcorn for the 2oz. maker. I found this on Amazon less than 2 weeks before Christmas and had it wrapped and ready to go in plenty of time. This popcorn tastes wonderful. Friends and family love it and I will keep on ordering this as long as my popcorn maker keeps popping. This package makes just enough for two kids at snack time and two paks for the adults also. Very pleased.
1;"""we just purchased a movie theater style popcorn maker.  We used the basic oil and popcorn but just didn't get the movie theater taste that we were looking for.  Then we purchased the Great Northern Popcorn.  Awesome taste"
1;"""We have one of the smaller 4 foot Nostalgia popcorn kettle poppers and the kettle doesn't seem too big and finding popcorn portions for it is not as easy as I had thought. Amazon to the rescue! -- I found these smaller portion packets (2.5 oz) and these packets seem to do the trick.  The popcorn was very good - just the right amount of salt and butter flavor.  No fault of the popcorn itself but rather the popcorn popper"
1;"""This popcorn actually tastes like the theater popcorn. All the kernals pop up and it makes ALOT of popcorn. You don't need to add anything extra to it after it's popped to make it flavorful because it is so good on it's own. Just be aware that the oil pack is hard. It's almost like stick butter but it quickly melts in the popper. I just mention that because at first"
1;"""Got a popcorn cart for Christmas and I have been trying to tweak my popcorn proportions. NO need with these packs! They make delicious batches of popcorn that taste just like the theater! Delicious and perfect!<br /><br />(I do find them to be salty"
1;"""This is great tasting movie theater popcorn that can be enjoyed in your popcorn machine for days after being popped. It is good to have a convienent 4oz package to easily make up great tasting batches of popcorn when wanted. We have a Nostalgia Electric 4oz Movie Time Popcorn Cart in our home theater room and this makes it perform like a professional model producing real movie theater popcorn. You can even add a tiny bit of Orville Redenbacher's Buttery Flavor Popping and Topping oil to get extra butter flavor"
1;This is great popcorn and I too have the Whirly Pop. The 4oz packs work wonderfully. I have not found it too salty or the packages leak. I have found the recent price of $35 too expensive and have purchased direct from Great American for half the price.
1;My Grandkids love it and so do we! Pops easy and tastests great. A bag of it came when I had to replace my old popcorn popper and we've been using it ever sense. My grandkids and their friends think I make the best popcorn ever!
1;I bought the 8 oz Black popcorn machine with stand and a box of 24 popcorn packs.  I've used this item dozens of times and just love it.  It works great with the pre mesured packs but also works just as well with store bought oils and popcorn.  We have movie night at least 2 times a month at my house and could not have as much fun with out our machine.  Excelnt product.
1;"""I will not be trying any other popcorn for as long I can get this from Amazon. The 4oz portion pack is perfect for our whirleypop and the popcorn is great.  As I have read in other reviews the oil can be solid while in the package"
1;We bought an old-fashioned trolley popcorn machine for our children at church. These packages make popping popcorn in large quantities so easy. It takes about 1 package to feed 8-10 kids. We preheat the unit and dump the contents of the package into the bucket and that's it.  The popcorn tastes and smells like movie-theater popcorn.  Everyone loves it and we've had no negative complaints.
1;"""We just LOVE this popcorn. We got introduced to it when I bought my wife a true popcorn machine (Great Norther 4oz Chaplain Popper and Cart). The popper and popcorn have been a wonderful addition to our home for the last 4 years and I have no plans to change any time soon.<br /><br />The simplicity of the popcorn kit packaging is great. Premeasured popcorn"
1;"""I have a Waring WPM35 which is a 10 cup popper. I use these Great Northern 8 oz. portion packs. I also use the 2 oz. popcorn bags which have a 5  in diameter opening size and they are just right to stuff your hand easily into them to get that last kernel.  This product is easy because everything you need is in one pack"
1;"""Popcorn pops up with minimal  un-popped  corn. Love the flavor the oil gives the popcorn. Better than theater popcorn and I can make it fresh any time I want. I bought this size to go with the  West Bend 2.5 oz popper. I will definitely be buying more."""
1;"""got a popcorn machine as a gift for a basement family room.  have tried a few different popcorn oil products and been disappointed with the taste.  probably a little pricier to buy everything prepackaged this way"
1;This popcorn looks and tastes just like the movies! Just throw it in our popcorn popper and turn the crank....comes out fluffy and smells and tastes like we are at the theater. Been looking for great popcorn and finally found it!
1;"""We have a trolley style popcorn maker and used popcorn oil and popcorn bought at the grocery store at first. We had many unpopped kernels and the taste was only okay.<br /><br />Then I ordered a case of Great Northern Popcorn 8-Ounce Portion Packs. This popcorn is great! We love the taste even three days after popping on the occasion when it lasts that long. We just followed the instructions on the package and all is well.<br /><br />I was a little concerned when I first noticed the oil was in a soft"
1;I work at the public library and we have family movie programs on a regular basis. There could be anywhere from 10 to 60 people watching the movie and I need to have the popcorn ready at a steady pace. We have one of the big popcorn machines on a cart and use Great Northern Popcorn's 8 ounce packs. The popcorn tastes great and the packaging is perfect for our needs.
1;"""This is amazing stuff. The Minor's bases were recommended to me by one of the instructors at the New Orleans School of Cooking. He used some of the chicken base to make the eight cups of stock he used in a gumbo he was demonstrating. I've tried the beef and the chicken"
1;I have been using Minor's stock for years.<br /><br />Family and friends rave about the stock base that my wife and I use.<br /><br />I Buy it at BJ's which is about half of Amazon's price not counting the shipping cost.
1;"""I'm so thankful that Trader Joe's is selling some of its products online!  This grain mix is one of the few items that our son will eat and the stash that I mailed home to Colorado when I was on the east coast for a conference is running low.  I wish Trader Joe's would come to Denver but this is a good stop-gap.<br /><br />Cook the mix with chicken broth"
1;I discovered Bigelow's Vanilla Carmel tea a couple summers ago. (I also enjoyed the Hazelnut one but apparently the company no longer makes it.) I have tried a variety of other brands but have always come back to Bigelow. It has the best and most consistent flavor of all the other ones I have tried.
1;I have been drinking this tea for about 6 years. I drink nothing else but an occasional water. I have suggested this tea for several people try. Nine out of ten people agreed with me. I drink it hot or cold. The aroma it gives off smells delicious. If you drink tea a little or a lot you will love this one.
1;"""I have this tea around all the time as a treat.  It is smooth and sweet and is great when you are having a craving for something sweet.  Several months ago I stopped seeing it in our local grocery stores and missed having it.  So I checked out Amazon and was happy to find it here.  I was worried about purchasing a 6 pack"
1;Bigelow's Vanilla Caramel tea is not only delicious is smells heavenly.  Whenever i drink it at work people stop by to see where the wonderful aroma is coming from. The flavor is pleasant and delicate.  I find it relaxing.  I also drink it when I am hungry and on a diet as it makes me feel satisfied as if I had a treat.<br /><br />Ali Julia review
1;Drinking a cup right. Go great plain by its self but AMAZING with cream and sugar. Smooth and creamy taste that can easily replace hot cocoa. It's also a great pick me up. I hate drinking that poison popularly known as Coffee.<br /><br />BE WARNED: It's very addictive. I can't stop drinking it!!!
1;Bigelow Vanilla Caramel tea is the most delicious tea I have ever tasted. I  use Silk soy creamer with the tea to add an extra vanilla taste. I make my 5 cup pot of tea every morning using 3 bags of the Bigelow caramel tea with 2 bags of Bigelow decaffeinated English tea. I like my tea slightly decaffeinated. I wish you made a decaffeinated caramel vanilla tea because the taste would probably be mind blowing.
1;"""Working odd hours I'm always looking for the latest/greatest energy drink that doesn't make me crash and actually does it's job.  I'm not a coffee drinker so these energy drinks are my only saving grace.  Having had the others out there"
1;"""We have been giving our 12 year old Yorkie the greenies for several years.  My husband found the senior version a few months ago and now our little old dog is hooked on these.  They are just soft enough for him to chew and really enjoy"
1;"""My elderly Pomeranian LOVES these Senior Greenies (even more than regular greenies) and absolutely never lets us forget this 4 o'clock daily treat (I never have been able to fully understand how dogs tell time"
1;"""I was very glad to finally find a way to recieve my favorite tea.  I am unable to purchase Cinnamon Stick Tea in the Nashville and surrounding areas...and drank it on a daily basis when we lived in Texas. So when I searched and found you had it"
1;This is my all-time favorite tea.  There is a nice hint of cinnamon that is great at any time of day.  I can easily go through 4 of these teabags a day.  Probably 90 percent of the hot tea I drink is Bigelow Cinnamon Stick Tea.  I've tried other cinnamon teas and by far this is the best one yet.  Thank you Bigelow and thank you Amazon.com for carrying this--and in bulk.
1;I used to drink this tea as a child and can no longer find it in stores. It's unlike other cinnamon teas I've tried which are usually blended with other spices or fruity flavors.  This one is just cinnamon and tea - and it's perfect.
1;"""This black tea is a morning ritual for me.  I could not find it in any of my local grocery stores so I was very pleased to find it sold in a 6 pack at such a reasonable price here on Amazon.com!  Once you try the invigorating"
1;This is my second favorite of the Bigalow teas I have tried (behing the vanilla chai). It has a great smell and flavor.<br /><br />I usually have it with honey but have allowed it to cool to luke warm and mixed it with whisky once and found that it is an awesome fat-free/sugar-free mixer as well.
1;"""I use the Plantation Mint to make sun tea.  It is so refreshing to have it iced after working in the yard in the hot sun.  I love that their teas are individually in foil packets so it stays fresh.  This is a great price"
1;For about more than 20 years... 3 cups of Plantation Mint per day.  And I'm still alive... Must be good for me.  Seriously great tea.  There is NOTHING else like it... I've tried many and nothing is bold and yet smooth and good quality as Plantation Mint.  I seriously fear the day that Bigelow discontinues it.  Please.... Don't do that!
1;"""This tea had been my favorite for years -- something about it is so much better than your run-of-the-mill mint tea.  I haven't been able to find it at the grocery stores in the area for the last few years and then a lightbulb went on!  I checked Amazon"
1;"""I love this Bigelow flavor!  Plantation Mint is a rich basic black tea with a fairly strong spearmint flavor.  One of my favorite moments with this tea is taking a nice deep whiff of the aroma from the tea bag right after opening the foil pouch"
1;I've used Heinz' Spicy Brown Mustard for many years.  I enjoy both the product and the fact I can take mustard with me on my travels in individual packets.  Thank you for both the great taste and the convenience.
1;"""There was a commercial that advertised its product as  good and good for you .  Oatmeal Crisp fits that description. High cholesterol is one of my life ills and oatmeal is supposed to be a good tool against it"
1;This Cookie is Very chewy!  and Chocolatey...So Worth buying!  The best Gluten Free cookie  Ever!  I baked the cookies for 9 to 10 min  then cooled them  and froze them  boy do they taste awesome frozen!  They are the only Gluten Free Chocolate chip cookie that actually taste like  it should... Good Job NOW!
1;"""The dough itself is delicous! and its the first gluten free cookie that actually taste like a chocolate chip cookie! It taste very good its worth the try! <br /><br />Being From Now foods  I Was unsure of this product  but man o man  yum!  They are cheaper on Swanson vitamins"""
1;"""..the unused in portions for up to 6 months. Discovered this trick after buying a large can then not using all at that time .. one also can add fresh herbs / Basil etc and make 'ice cubes' in a tray then bag and snap off as many as desired when needed. A little bit goes a long way in flavoring Mashed potatoes/long grain rice/Barley-vegetable soups etc. Moderation is always the key word when using any products in cooking ..<br /><br />Extracted from: collegeinn.com<br /><br />>>Beef Broth"
1;"""These are DELICIOUS! My co-worker was bringing these into work daily and I found myself stealing several pieces throughout the day from her stash. I finally decided to buy my own bag and have her steal from me for a change. They are so yummy and addictive. Nutritious too"
1;Sooooooooo tasty that I came to Amazon looking for more as I ate the whole bag in a week!  I LOVE the sweet/salty play of tastes of this treat!  Right now I'm ordering a bag for me and one for a good friend.  Five stars plus!
1;"""I'm not exaggerating when I say that I was a hardcore caffeine addict last semester with microbiology and organic chemistry to study for. I'd say 4-5 cups of coffee/day would be an accurate count - that is until I realized how jittery i'd become after my 3rd or 4th cup. I stopped cold turkey once finals ended and the withdrawal effects were horrible - I could not wake up past noon. I always liked how mio made my water taste better"
1;Great item at a great price!  Fast delivery and free shipping.  I was very satisfied with this high quality olive oil in that size bottle.  I got two bottles and will get more in the future if the price remains the same.
1;Bertolli is the best tasting olive oil. I have tried others and this is best to make olive oil dips and dressings. I use this for all my cooking from sauteing to frying. I even made a great olive oil mayonaise with this. My whole family loves it. Not only does it taste good it is good for you.
1;"""I'm a health nut so I love cooking with EVOO or eat it raw with rye bread. It's great for both your insides and outsides. I could go on and on about the good things evoo is but I must state that I have acne prone skin and literally tried everything on the market. I used evoo and a little bit of lemon juice as a moisturizer"
1;"""So I have to admit that I am a cinnamon NUT.  I just plain love the spice in so many recipes I could never count. When Quaker first put this out I was a few trepidations about it.  Having loved the original flavor of Life cereal since as far back as I can remember I wasn't sure how they could add cinnamon to it and make it work - they did.  I'm one that loves to mix cereals and this one mixed with the Cinnamon Burst Cheerio's - love it so much I pretty much have this every day!<br />Get a box and try it!  If you enjoy cinnamon AND you enjoy original I think you'll enjoy this.  I do wish Amazon hadn't removed the 'Subscribe and Save' option - in all honesty"
1;"""Love the cereal!  But a word to the wise regarding purchasing the 6-pack via the Subscribe and Save program...  the price on this item seems to fluctuate significantly.<br /><br />When I first ordered it in Jan. 2011 (and signed-on to periodically reorder at a 90 day interval via Subscribe and Save) the price was $9.62.  When my next shipment arrived"
1;This soup mix makes a tasty addition to any multiple course meal.  It also makes a great pick me up when you have a head cold.  The mix of seasonings and ingredients gives this soup a rich flavor that is better than many watered down home recipes.
1;There are cheaper coffees out there and I have probably tried a good percentage of them.  I always end up coming back to Folgers about it there is just something natural about or maybe I am used to it.  The prices on Folgers can vary greatly in stores and the deal is better on Amazon.  I would recommend it at this price.
1;best tasting salt I have ever tried.  The mineral content makes it pink in color and also adds to the wonderful flavor.  I consider this one of my better purchases.  I use it in my Cuisinart salt grinder.  Absolutely wonderful salt.
1;"""We used to buy this coffee pretty often but the local supermarkets started cutting back on selections and raising prices and the Community whole bean coffees became expensive and not always available.  While the price of coffees seem to be rising recently"
1;I had been buying this coffee at the local Wal Mart but all of a sudden they don't carry it any more and can't find it in any local supermarkets so I guess I will order it from Amazon from here on out.  The price is also better here and if I add an extra item (I could always use more CDs!) it's free super saver shipping!
1;Community Coffee Co based in New Orleans makes a fresh and wonderful product priced reasonable for the quality. I ordered from their website directly but now order from Amazon for price and free shipping. I highly recommend this coffee and other roast varieties they offer try them and see for yourself. Find out which is your favorite. Throughout the year they offer special limited time roasts that are amazingly delicious.
1;My grandson loves the variety this package offers when making his snow cones.  The variety is great.  So many wonderful flavors to try.  No need to store a bottle afterwards which is good also.  Thanks.
1;"""At last a really delicious bread mix that tastes like real bread.  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and added 5 tablespoons of ground flaxseed.  I don't have a bread machine and it was a bit tricky to mix with my old hand mixer but it rose beautifully and baked up perfectly.  The smell of freshly baked bread was wonderful.  We couldn't wait and cut the loaf before it was completely cool.  No problem!  The loaf was moist and tasted like real bread.  Maybe the flaxseed and coconut oil helped.  The bread was fresh for days right up until the last crumb was gobbled up.  Sliced thinly"
1;We have paid over $5 a package in health food stores for this mix.  Buying via Amazon is both cheaper and easier thanks to the direct to the door shipping!  The mix works great in our bread machine and comes out perfect every time!  Our kids love it and usually eat half a loaf as soon as its done!
1;"""This bread mix is the absolutley best replacement for wheat flour bread we have found.  It smells yummy baking and the taste and consistancy makes a delicious sandwich.  It also makes great french toast.  This works great in a bread machine"
1;This is the best Gluten FREE bread!!  But you do have to cook it longer than it says on the package or it will not be done in the middle.  I cook it a total  of 78 minutes. After the first 20 I cover it with tinfoil so it does not get too brown then after 50 min I uncover it and let it cook another 8 mins.  YUMMY!!!
1;I love Pamela's Products wheat free bread. It has the closest taste to real bread. I also use her baking mix as a substitute for flour in several of my old recipes. My family can't tell if it's wheat flour or gluten free. Love it!!!
1;"""This is by far the best GF bread mix I've tried. I have made some super tasty  from scratch  GF loaves in my Zojirushi bread machine but none of them hold together for hearty sandwiches as well as Pamela's mix does. It is fabulous toasted or untoasted"
1;We have a family in our church that are gluten intolerant and therefore can't use regular bread for Communion.  This bread mix is great for this and does not make the family feel different from everyone else. The mix is super easy to fix and makes a great loaf of tasty bread.  So glad we found it!
1;It is so wonderful to use my bread machine again and have the smell the aroma of fresh baked bread.  The taste far exceeded my expectations.  I woofed it down so fast that I don't recall tasting any difference from any of the non-gf breads I used to make before diagnosis. I did not even care that it fell during the baking process (supposed to create a 2 lb. loaf and I made it in my 1 1/2 lb. machine and it was less than that after falling). I read somewhere that someone else had this problem and added a little extra yeast and it had worked.
1;I really like Pamela's brand mixes.  It's nice to have gluten free mixes that DO taste good. :) The recipes on the bags are awesome plus you can go to Pamela's website for addition recipes.  If you haven't tried this brand yet don't put it off it's wonderful.
1;I loved this bread. I have used some other brands before but this one is the best for me. I have now made 6 loaves of it and have been pleased every time. The taste is good and so is the texture. I love bread and when I found out I had a wheat allergy and could not eat regular bread anymore my heart sank. But since I found Pamela's Wheat Free & Gluten Free Bread Mix I am one happy Grandma again
1;I make 3 to 4 loaves of bread each week. Pamela's Wheat Free Gluten Free Bread mix makes it soo much easier. I have never had a loaf made from Pamela's bomb. The bread is very delicious and does not need to be warmed or toasted.
1;Pamela's gluten-free bread is THE best!  It is miles ahead of other gluten-free brands.  The bread is delicious and moist.  We use a bread maker and add in raisins or cranberries to enhance the enjoyablity of the bread.  It is also excellent toasted.
1;I feel bad for alot of other gf bread/baking flour makers because if more peopl discover the goodnes of pamela bread mix they would go out of business my sister and I are celiac and believe me we tried it all. We tried baking our own to purchasing about every different mix we could find and It came down to pamelas or brm because they are more readily available at local grocery stores. Let me tell you Pamela blows them all away. I've had family member and co-workers (who by this time were pretty scared of taste testing my gf baked goods) completly surprised some even said they preferred over wheat varieties. The Sweet bread recipe taste almost like a moist potato bread. Sorry BRM
1;My son just started the gfcf diet due to severe intolerances to both.  We've been on the diet as a family so finding a good sandwich bread has been a top priority for the past month and a half.  I've tried countless recipes in a cookbook I have as well as a couple of mixes and none of them were what I was looking for even though my 2 year old would eat them.  None of them were terrible just they didn't taste like the bread I remembered.  My mother in law was kind enough to buy me this mix at the health food store near her house as mine only sold the big $15 bag mix which I didn't want to buy unless I knew we'd use it.  I am so glad she bought this!  I followed the bread machine instructions.  Baked one night and let it cool while we all slept.  We had sandwiches for lunch the next day and boy was I surprised when the bread actually tasted like BREAD!  I still have a few recipes I want to try out but this is definitely going to be a staple in our house!  Thank you Pamela's for gfcf bread that actually tastes like bread!  It's a lifesaver!
1;"""I've tried a number of gluten-free breads and bread mixes and they all tasted like sawdust...but this mix from Pamela's Products is the exception.  It is moist and heavy but is close in texture and taste to  regular  bread when used for sandwiches and such. I slice mine real thin. I cannot get it to toast"
1;I was recently diagnosed with sensitivity to wheat (the Doc stopped short of a full celiac test and diagnosis). I used to love eating bread. This product is terrific if you follow the instructions for the machine. The last loaf I made I used olive oil instead of canola. What a difference! The problem now is how to keep a loaf for a week - it gets eaten so quickly! I thoroughly recommend Pamela's Products.
1;This is the softest bread I have found. It makes sandwiches that do NOT crumble apart the way most GF breads do. It is the easiest mix I have made in my bread machine. I highly recommend this bread. We made pizza dough out of this mix (thin Crust) and it was great even other members of the family who do not have to eat GF enjoyed it.
1;"""I discovered that I was gluten-intolerant about a year ago and have been looking for good-tasting wheat-free products ever since.  My primary roadblock has been bread - every single loaf of gluten-free bread I've tried has been beyond disgusting.  I've been to health food store after health food store and haven't found a single loaf that I can eat without gagging.  I thought it was hopeless until I read the reviews of Pamela's Amazing Wheat-Free Bread Mix.  I decided to give it a shot"
1;"""I have been searching for a good-tasting wheat-free bread mix since I found out I cannot have wheat. This is by far the BEST that I have tried. And you can make it in your bread maker. I also cannot have dairy or eggs"
1;"""Pamela's Wheat-Free Amazing Bread Mix is perhaps the best mix currently available for people that can not tolerate Gluten.  The texture and taste is the closest I've found to a dense wheat bread.  I frequently add nuts and seeds"
1;This is a wonderful bread mix.  It is very easly to make.  The texture of the resulting loaf of bread is the same whether you use the recommended 'heavy-duty stand mixer' or a hand held mixer.  I am very pleased with this product and will continue to buy it for my gluten-free bread needs.
1;"""Both of my children are gluten intolerant and one with wheat allergy.  They never thought they would eat a sandwich or taste good pizza dough again until Pamela's.  They have tried many different bread mixes and nothing compares to the quality and taste of Pamela's bread mix.  Actually"
1;Being wheat and dairy allergic has many challenges - finding a tasty product that I can eat is the biggest.  Making bread with this product has been an answer to prayer. Thank You Pamela's.<br />Linda Humes
1;This is absolutely the best gluten free bread mix ever!  I have tried them all.  You cannot buy GF bread as good as you can make at home.  Amazon.com is the cheapest place to get it too!  It's not always easy to find in specialty stores. Amazon.com always has it!
1;This wheat free bread mix is great my whole family enjoys the taste and we add ground flax to it also.  We have done the pizza with the same mix and it is also good.  All good for us wheat free gluten free families.  Great product!!!
1;"""This is the ONLY bread mix we use.  We usually make the  sweet bread  recipe and use Equal instead of sugar.  My son waits for it to come out of the breadmaker. Add some butter and a little cinnamon and sugar... and yum yum a great little snack for your gluten free baby!"""
1;This is great bread.  We recently found out my husband was allergic to wheat.  I tried finding any kind of bread that tasted like we were used to.  This bread is great.  My husband absolutely loves it!  I actually even like to eat this bread even though I'm not allergic to wheat and I don't even miss the bread I was used to.  Definately a must try!<br /><br />Mandee Burt<br />Bruma's Gift Shop<br />www.brumasgiftshop.com
1;"""I have spent the last year trying to perfect my own mix of flours to gain both taste and fiber content. Many of the flours I used were difficult to find locally and some I had to grind myself.  Often the bread was heavy tasting or donwright strange tasting"
1;"""This bread is the answer for my husband's  NEED  for bread. I also add different herbs and spices for some change. He loves the onion powder and Italian Seasonings and the Cinnamon/Sugar. Great product!"""
1;This bread is TRULY AMAZING!  Pamela's bread tastes THE most like regular bread and all of the recipes on the bag are wonderful.  It never crumbles and doesn't have that strong starchy flavor that other gluten free breads have.  We can have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches again!  I always have Pamela's bread on hand!
1;We have tried several gluten free packaged bread and bread mixes. All the packaged breads taste like cardboard-this mix actually has the consistency of sandwich bread. We use it for sandwiches and to make garlic bread when we have gluten free spaghetti(brush melted butter with garlic powder on one side at a time and brown in a frying pan).
1;"""It has been 11 months since I began a gluten free diet and this is the first bread I've eaten which tastes good. It is moist and holds together well even when sliced warm out of the bread maker. I bake it in a Breadman TR 875 and follow the directions on the bag of the bread mix (which says to NOT use the gluten free setting). I'm baking bread from Pamela's bread mix for my 11 year old granddaughter who also must eat gluten free. It allows her to take sandwiches to school like the other kids. The bread toasts well and probably freezes well"
1;When I was diagnosed with celiac disease I stopped eating bread because it tasted so bad.  My friend Lois shared the bread with me and it tasted like real bread and it was soft.  At first they were out of pamelas and I tried a different brand but it wasnt so good.  I started getting it every 2 months but Iate it so quickly I get it every month.  I am anxiously waiting for the shipment to come because I am out of the bread.
1;This is the best wheat-free bread mix I've used. The bread comes out great and can be used for toast and sandwiches. I make it in my bread machine on the wheat bread setting and it comes out perfect. I use egg whites instead of whole eggs and soy milk for most of the water and it is soft and rich tasting!
1;I tried a lot of gluten free bread before I found Pamelas.  It is the best and you can make it in your bread machine.  It is dense and moist and tastes great and you can add items to make different variations.
1;My son is on a gluten free diet and he has had a really hard time without his bread!  This bread tastes good and is very easy to make in the bread maker.  I have tried to make several different gluten free breads from scratch and they either taste terrible or don't hold together.
1;"""This is the best no wheat/no dairy bread I have tried. It has excellent consistency and flavor. The best thing is that it stays moist. It is great for sandwiches or toast. I use my bread machine and it comes out fine. Other breads I have tried do not measure up to these features of best flavor"
1;"""I love this mix because it is so simple to make and my kids love the taste.<br />We buy it by the case. We make two packages at a time and freeze one loaf (cut in two) while enjoying the other loaf. This cuts down on clean up and time in the kitchen.<br /><br />One tip... I cut preparation time in half by doing the following: I mix the yeast into the flour first"
1;"""This is the best all-around GF bread I've found. The taste and texture are good. It stays moist and soft even after refrigeration or sitting in a lunch box for a few hours. To save money I bake mostly from scratch"
1;"""My son is allergic to wheat and eggs and this mix makes by far the best bread one can hope without these two ingredients. I use this mix in our bread machine with an egg replacer and it makes a nice loaf with a good texture and great taste"
1;"""Wow!!!  One of the best gluten-free breads that I have tasted (and I have tasted a bunch).  My son loves this bread and we use it for all his sandwiches AND I make him mini pizzas on this bread too!!  Tastes great untoasted"
1;"""We have tried 3 different gluten free bread mixes for our bread maker.  Tried every brand of ready mades on store shelves and freezer cases.  Pamela's Gluten-Free bread mix is by far better in taste and texture than any others.  And simple to do.  The even nicer plus is the smell of fresh  home made  bread baking and eating it warm from the  oven .  Yum!  It really is amazingly good."""
1;"""I have been buying this bread mix for several years now due to my gluten free intolerance.  I have never been dissatisfied with any loaf that comes out of my breadmaker.  It tastes especially good toasted"
1;"""I have been gluten free for 5 years and this is the best gluten free bread I have had.  It is easy to make in the oven or in the bread maker (you must be able to make 2 pound loaves in your bread maker). This bread is not all crumbly like most breads.  It is moist"
1;"""We have tried several kinds of gluten free bread for my celiac son who is three years old.  This has been the best overall in texture and taste.  It smells wonderful when its baking too.  We use a bread machine on the lightest crust at rapid bake"
1;I bought several packages as I wanted to try the bread and also the pie crust.  The pie crust was made from the bread mix and made a great flaky crust for my pumpkin pie.  I also made bread stuffing as my sister is gluten intolerant.  The bread itself was good also.
1;"""This is by far the best GF bread we've found for our 8 year old who has Celiacs.  Super easy to bake in our West End Hi Rise bread maker - simply follow directions and the loaf comes out perfectly.  It has a very child friendly taste - I disagree with other reviewers that say it is too sweet"
1;"""My wife and I have now been enjoying the moist and sweet flavor ofPamela's bread mix for the last year and a half. Other mixes we have tried tasted flat and sparce on flavor. Outside of being a little pricey"
1;I have tried a lot of bread mixes and most are hard and only good for 1-2 days. Pamela's bread mix is soft and lasts a week. It tastes great too! I have celiac and let my doctor know how great this product is so he can tell other patients.
1;This is the best gluten-free bread I have ever had.  It doesn't break apart like the others.  It is almost cake-like in texture and has a wonderful flavor.  Buying from Amazon is approximately $2.00 cheaper per loaf than buying it at our market.  Great product.
1;"""We couldn't wait and cut the loaf before it was completely cool. No problem! The loaf was moist and tasted like real bread. Maybe the flaxseed and coconut oil helped. The bread was fresh for days right up until the last crumb was gobbled up. Sliced thinly"
1;My husband has had to have gluten free food for several years.  We have tried several different bread mixes and this is the first that he actually enjoys.  Buying it on Amazon saves me between $1.50 to $2.00 a loaf!
1;"""Pamela's Bread mix is one of the best that have tasted since becoming Gluten Free.<br />I went through a few Brands and could not even finish a Loaf of bread it was so tasteless.<br />When I tried Pamela's Bread mix I made the sweet bread recipe on the back"
1;"""The White Chocolate is the most moist and best tasting flavor (in mine and my husbands opinion at least) and I will only be ordering this flavor for now on.  I have Celiac Disease and I'm a Type 1 diabetic and also a model and a Las vegas Showgirl so I have to eat healthy"
1;Thease bars are Fantastic !!<br /><br />Lots of protein and low sugar but they do not taste like cardboard.<br /><br />I am a big fan now..and I am going to get them shipped every month<br />and save 15% !!
1;"""I had tried this bar before so I knew I liked it. Honestly White Chocolate is the best flavor. I received a fresh shipment from amazon and there was no doubt whether they were good quality or not. This bar is a chocolate nougat with a white chocolate coating. I personally don't find a chemical after taste but I usually eat sugar free products or usually eat food sans sugar"
1;This is one of the best tasting protein bars on the market.  It is very satisfying and perfect for a quick breakfast.<br />Not to sweet and very filling. The fact that it is gluten free is an added plus.
1;These White Chocolate Protein Bars from Think Thin are fabulous!  With 20 grams of protein they are a great choice!  Flavor is great!  Best pricing available at Amazon.com.  LOVE the auto-ship feature.
1;These are absolutely delicious! They satisfy my graving for something sweet & they are really filling. Great for the early morning when you do not have time to make breakfast & great for an afternoon snack at work when you're feeling sluggish.
1;So I thought thinkthin creamy peanut butter was my favoooorite (but) white chocolate chip has won my heart. I love having one of these when I'm in a rush with a tall glass of unsweetened almond milk ..mmm. They are super good and contain 20 grams of PROTEIN! I love them :). Never have I ordered them from amazon I pick mine up at whole foods/HEB/ or kroger. Try them!
1;Gluten free and sugar free white chocolate bars with 20g of protein... doesn't get any better than this.  These are my favorite out of all the flavors of Think Thin bars.  I'm on Subscribe and Save and get 2 boxes per month.<br /><br />Buying from Amazon is the cheapest way to get these bars.  I save about $5.00 per box as compared to buying them at the store.<br /><br />I have to admit the first bar I had tasted slightly chemically... I think it must be the vitamin B I'm tasting??  But now they are absolutely delicious and I crave these bars!!
1;I ABSOLUTELY LOVE these bars!!! I'd be curious to know if those who did not like the taste are stilling eating refined sugar? I've had very little refined sugar since November 2009 and find these bars to be better than any candy I ever eaten. Please don't ever stop making these bars!!!!!
1;"""I had been watching this specific coffee for a few months and it was never in stock. When it FINALLY became available I jumped on it. I was not let down. The flavor isn't so much that you lose the coffee taste which is always a big selling point for me. It's a mild coffee"
1;"""I purchased 144 (2 lots of 72) for my husband who was previously buying another brand at 2 for $1.  They were delivered in time for Christmas which was great because his crew had purchased an Amazon gift card as his Christmas present.  I've had no trouble with open packages and the seeds are delicious.  Meaty and not too salty"
1;"""I am so glad that Amazon carries this in Prime now. We've been buying from petsmart which is both expensive and inconvenient. I really hope that let me subscribe and save at some point in the future!<br /><br />Regarding the product"
1;"""Our cats won't eat anything else. Even our Desert Tortoise eats it! Petco ran out of Avoderm once so I purchase another well known brand. My cats turned their noses up at it. Never again... now I buy it from Amazon"
1;"""Popchips are great - so flavorful and better for you than regular chips.  I ordered the pack of (12) 3 oz (full size - same as in the grocery store) bags.  Below are the flavors I received:<br />- Barbecue (2 bags)<br />- Original (1 bag)<br />- Thai Sweet Chili (1 bag)<br />- Parmesan Garlic (1 bag)<br />- Jalapeno (1 bag)<br />- Cheddar (1 bag)<br />- Sweet Potato (1 bag)<br />- Sea Salt & Vinegar (1 bag)<br />- Salt & Pepper (1 bag)<br />- Chili Lime (1 bag)<br />- Sour Cream & Onion (1 bag)<br /><br />As far as ordering the (12) 3oz bags vs the (24) 0.8 oz bags"
1;"""I've used this flour for nearly 20 years.  It's higher protein properties lend its self nicely to perfect bread baking.  However . . .read the product details carefully.  This is for an 80 ounce (5 lbs) bag of flour . . that's  seven times higher than the price at your local grocery store.  Furthermore"
1;I put this in Bertolli's Extra Light Tasting Olive Oil and it was amazing!  I did cut the amount of seasoning just a smidge though.  Everyone loved it.  Not one of the ingredients is stronger than the others and you can taste them all.  I found this at a store that let you taste test all the Dean Jacob's Bread Dipping flavors and this was the best by far.
1;"""It's not the 7 buck deal I got in March 2012 and at over 13 bucks now it's actually much cheaper in the stores. I purchased the 20oz. pack of 3 so that was about 2.34 a box and close to what I was paying in stores so I went for the free shipping and bought two. I'm in a rural area and it's a long trip to the store so we go about once a month and having this deal meant I didn't have to look at several stores to find the best price. However"
1;"""This was a Manager's Special for cheap (two bucks a box) that I gave a try. It has milled cane sugar as the second ingredient BUT that is soooo much better than High Fructose Corn Syrup for the human body. It's sweet enough to satisfy a sweet tooth or two. My teenager will eat ONE bowl and be satisfied versus  inhaling  bowls and bowls of fruity loopy stuff. I enjoy it because there's 26 of the recommended daily 48 grams of whole grains per serving"
1;I ordered this oil since I am a huge fan of the Nielsen-Massey vanilla and almond extracts. It makes the most delicious mint ice cream and I've often used if for Mint Oreo Icing during baking. You will not be disappointed and it is work every penny.
1;"""I cant figure out why Gerber 2nd peas are so hard to find in the store...I see something green and its always green beans! We go through peas so much in my house with my child and this is the only way we are going to buy them from now on. The box is very compact and I just remove the top and leave stored them right in the box. It saves a ton of room in the kitchen"
1;Love Folgers Lively Columbian K Cups. They are so easy to use and the coffee is wonderful. Tried many other kinds but this is all I will drink now. Hopefully the cost will come down. Hope they will make a 160 count so I don't have to order so soon.Shipping is the pits!
1;I have always been a Folgers coffee fan.  I am also a Keurig single cup coffee maker fan. I was thrilled when I discovered Folgers was making K-Cups and very satisfied with the price of the 80-count box I bought from Amazon.com.
1;The coffe is great.  I got a box of 80 k cups that turned out to make them 63 cents each.  I don't think that is toob bad.  They arrived promply and in great condition.  I'm very happy with the purchase.
1;I don't drink coffee but have many visitors who do.  I got the Kuerrig coffee maker as a gift last year and needed to replenish the K-cups.  Consumer Reports rated this brand #1 so I got them.  Rave reviews from those who have used them.
1;"""I grew up on Folgers coffee. It was simply the best affordable coffee that could be drank on a daily basis. I was glad that Folgers has formulated there distinct coffee for the K-Cup. A few years ago I did try using folgers ground coffee in one of those Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter and it just did not come out right. I have had no luck with the refillable K-Cup with any brand of coffee. I honestly believe that a lot of product testing goes into these K-cups. It's not as simple as fill it up and run water through it.<br /><br />Folgers Columbian K-cups taste exactly like I made it way back when with my Mr. Coffee. Becuse you are able to adjust the amount of coffee used in the Drip brewers this may or may not be as perfect of a match for your tastes. The one constant is the all important aftertaste. The Extra-Bold Newman's own and Doughnut Shop K-cups have a long"
1;I have tried so many k cup coffees and products. Bought a k cup coffeemaker for mom & friend and myself but I have been dissapointed in the quality of the coffee until I got the Folgers. Taste like good Folgers coffee on the quick. A bit expensive but you have no wasted coffee.
1;I always go to my local spot to get some bbq pork. I've always wanted to make it myself. with the bbq sauce makes it even better. next time I cook some I'm going to try smoking some pork and put this stuff on. I'm looking forward to it!
1;"""Honey Stinger Peanut Butter 'N Honey are THE best tasting energy bars out on the market!  I use them on 70-80 miles bike rides and they provide enough fuel to power me through my long rides.  The taste is awesome...almost like a candybar (think Butterfinger)...and they sit well in my tummy. I wish more stores carried them locally"
1;I love Rosarita Refried Beans.  I grew up in Mesa Az where these beans were manufactured (at least a long time ago) and I have always thought they were the best on the market.  I can't always find them on the east coast so when I saw them available through Amazon I was thrilled.  They have a smooth texture and subtle taste so they can be used in any recipe.
1;Like I said in the title... you can take them through airport security and on the plane! Much cheaper than buying in any of their shops and is healthier than all that junk food they have. All of them are pretty good. I recommend the tropical blend as well.
1;"""these are really tasty. it doesnt taste anything like the other dried apples ive tasted. they're definately in their own category. and yes they kind of taste like the freeze dried ones except a little less sour and more crunchy"
1;I live in an area where everything has to be brought in and getting any sort of dried apple is almost impossible.  These are great! Crunchy and do not lose their flavor!  A bit pricey for such as small portion but on subscxription a really good deal.
1;These snacks are so very delicious.  I am always looking for a healthy snack and I was pleasantly surprised when I found Sensible Foods.<br /><br />They are so satisfying and delicious that I my biggest problem is having enough in the house.<br /><br />My sons love them and that is always a great thing.  I am so very pleased that they grab for these healthy snacks rather than junk.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.  Just make sure to buy alot...they will disappear quickly.
1;U-No candy bars are my very favorite!  They were only distributed in Calif. so they haven't become widely known but are popular with CA candy lovers.  I started eating them when I was a young child and still find them as delightful as I remembered. Try it.  You'll like it!
1;"""I gave this to my brother for Christmas and it was a big hit.  The instruments are well made and beautifully packaged.  He told me the tea was great - they even include some African honey.  They shipped really fast"
1;"""I recently found out through testing that my son has gluten and soy allergy among many others.  My son is also extremely sensitive to texture and flavor.<br />This mix was the only one that had a mild flavor"
1;"""My family needs gluten free products for some very serious health problems. Many products that I try to bake with just don't taste good. Cravings place TASTES sooo good that my boys have no idea that I am using  healthy  ingredients when serving baked goods or pancakes and waffles. Thank you so much for such an EASY and delicious product. Our family times at the breakfast table actually happen more often now because they all know they will enjoy the food and the company. I can cook more often because it is easy and fun for me. We are all happy and healthier."""
1;the cravings place pancakes is a great alternative to the other brands for those of us that can't have all the allergic ingredents. Taste good. Hope  they come up with more varieties of products and recipes.
1;I have been using this product for over a year. It is the best I have found for those of us who must remain Gluten free. Use care when ordering because it says FREE SHIPPING but when I used the one click shopping feature I was charged $10.45 for shipping and handling.
1;I used to have to order this by mail from NYC.  Or buy it in person and carry it home (heavy).  Now it is so easy to order online.  The best honey in the world.  I guess the Greek bees are sweeter than ours here in the US
1;The only honey that doesn't make me sneeze or give me an allergic reaction.<br />The Greeks are alone in producing this finest of honey.<br />We could all help their economy if we ALL would buy cases of this.<br />Bravo.
1;"""I love this Kcup for summer. The product is not too sweet and I load it up with extra fresh lemon juice and its so delicious and light tasting. I don't taste any kind of aftertaste or artifical flavor.  I admit"
1;"""I saw these in the supermarket at the checkout line and picked up the clusters. I figured they would taste bland and not be satisfying for the chocolate craving. While there aren't many in the package"
1;I got a similar variety pack at Costco and every flavor was amazing.  Unfortunately they left me wanting MORE!  Much better tasting than other 100 calorie snacks especially if you are a chocolate lover!
1;It would be hard to beat this variety of Ryvita for flavor and crunch.  Two make a satisfying snack and three make breakfast!  They go well with sweet or savory foods or fruit.  Try them with a good soup for lunch or crumbled into salad instead of croutons.  Personally I much prefer Ryvita to the thicker heavier crispbreads like Wasa which are sometimes just too robust (though do stand up very well to spreading with nut butters)or the very thin type (like Primula -which is hard to find in North America). The box protects the crispbread from breakage and the whole package of 10 boxes was well packed and arrived with no signs of damage.
1;I love these Compleats as they have only 210 calories as compared with 300# for most of the other Compleats.  This is hot and satisfying for lunch and I can still have a 70 calorie chocolate pudding without going over 300 calories.  Very helpful to keep weight down.  These are hard to find in my local grocery stores.
1;I have been searching and searching for a high end dog treat that one my dog would sniff and eat and two would eliminate or at least make bearable my dog's breath.  I am happy to say I found it in Old Mother Hubbard's Gimme A Kiss dog biscuits. He loves these biscuits and I now love his breath.  I noticed a change after the first biscuit. And as an added bonus the biscuits are made of all natural products.  I like knowing that my dogs diet is just as healthy as mine.
1;I fell in love with Stash chocolate mint tea two years ago.  I am thrilled to be able to buy it now in an economical and environmentally friendly way.  This is used for my private use and I've felt uncomfortable with all the many boxes I've gone through in order to have my six bag a day tea fix.  If you are a tea junkie and care about our landfill situation then go for broke and purchase this way and save yourself a couple of hundred bucks.
1;This flavor is my favorite I have tried so far - nice and spicy without being overpowering. Great price for buying these in bulk. The small bags are good to have on hand for passing out to your friends or co-workers too!
1;"""I bought a 2-pack of the liver flavored Everlasting Treats to see if my husky/g.shepherd puppy would like them. She ate the first one in one sitting. That wasn't very  everlasting  and at nearly $4/ea it was an expensive treat. The 2nd one she took 2 - 3 days to eat"
1;Our dogs love the Everlasting Vanilla Mint!  One dog will licks and the other dog chews but it takes them a long time to finish them when they are in the treat balls.  The treat ball has provided them with hours of entertainment this winter when we haven't been able to get out much.  We have tried the Chicken and Liver flavors as well but the vanilla mint is by far the favorite.
1;"""Both of my chihuahua mutts love these inserts. I use the treat in a bendo ball for one and she's busy for hours! The other pooch doesnt like the bendo ball but loves this treat.  He eats it in about 10 minutes.<br /><br />Def will stock up on these. Especially seeing as the dog that likes the treat in the ball is the more demanding of entertainment than the other - who is contented by just sitting next to me and snugglling.<br /><br />I just wish they were a bit less expensive"
1;"""I have to have a box of nerds at least once a week.  They really aren't that bad in terms of calories at 180 cal. for the whole box and they take a while to eat and that's always a good thing when you are watching your calories.<br /><br />They taste yummy (sweet and sour) and in terms of treats"
1;"""Thank you for your speedy reply.  I was pleased with the service. Your product was exactly what  I wanted. This is my favorite balsamic vinegar. I don't know what I would do without this product. I put it on so many of my foods"
1;"""Had the pleasure of trying this while visiting my parents back east. It is really really good! Not too salty and just plain tasty!! I was bummed to realize I couldn't purchase it around Seattle so I had to order some! Once you try this I know you will be hooked and at 35 calories a cup"
1;"""Spike has been an absolute fav of mine for years.  There is no comparison to enhance the flavor of all veggies.  Sprinkle and add a little olive oil for the barbie.  None of my local stores carry it anymore"
1;I love this product. Saw it on Dr.Oz show. Best product I ever purchase. Low sodium. I had problems with sodium and cholesterol. It has definitely help lower my cholesterol and sodium intake. I would recommend this product to everyone. I brought two and gave one to my daughter. I use it on all my food. It taste good and I use it on all my food. I do not need as much as I would if I was using actual salt to season my food.
1;Spike is my secret weapon in the kitchen.  I've been using this for 30 years. I used to have to go to the health food stores and it is harder and harder to find.  Thank goodness for Amazon. You can find anything here!!!
1;"""This Chai is so good.  It reminds me of powdered hot cocoa but I could also see paying 4.00 for something just like this in a coffee house!!  I love the flavor - it is a mild chai flavor.  Even though I watch my calories"
1;So it's Chai.  If you don't know Chai is a spiced tea.  In this case the overtone is vanilla.  It's got a little of everything you might get in pumpkin pie spice.  It's very tasty.  I use two scoops in a twice as large glass and I make it just with hot water.  You don't need to add milk.  Many of the local coffee bars actually use this brand.  You could of course make this whole thing yourself but this is a GREAT alternative. And of course Amazon is a great place to get it.  I actually love that they kind of remind me every couple of months to get more because I usually need it.
1;This is the same mix that my local coffee house uses in their latte's.  It's full of flavor and worth the price.  The only other Chai mix that  is better is Tastefully Simple's Oh My! Chai mix which is awesome!
1;I first tried this chai tea at a beach coffee shop while on vacation.  It was so good that I made my family go back to that location the next morning so I could find out what brand it was.  Big Train!!!  Now I'm hooked.
1;"""I have made Iced Chai Lattes with this mix for about five people now and they all LOVE it.  There are instructions on the side of the container that tell you how to do it.  It's very simple.  My only suggestions is this:  When it says to use 1 and 1/3 cups of powder"
1;This is the best vanilla chai you will ever have. we mix it up with milk and pour it over ice in the summer and have it warm like hot chocolate in the winter. absolutely perfect. the coffee shop down the street charges $4.50 for an iced vanilla chai made with this same mix. i'm saving a ton of money making it myself.
1;This stuff is great. I'm picky about chai flavor too. I was obsessed with getting these drinks at a coffee shop in FL for everrrr then found out what they use so I can just make my own (: It's really good blended with plain yogurt ice-cream and some milk. mmmmmm
1;"""The title for this review says it all -  Very Delicious.  I first encountered this brand at a local coffee shop in my neighborhood. I like it so much I went ahead and purchased two canisters and a frother just to be able to have a Chai Tea Latte whenever I desired.<br /><br />I discovered it's a challenge to find vanilla chai. Most chai teas out there seem to be  spicy.  But this brand is really smooth and is a very nice blend of many flavors"
1;I bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday. My girlfriend is VERY picky when it comes to food and drink choices and she couldn't be happier with Big Train Chai! She was first introduced to Big Train at a local coffee shop so I decided to buy her this to save cost and time. She actually makes her chai with cold milk and loves how easy it travels and stays fresh throughout the day. Her only complaint would be that the chai powder sometimes clumps because there is not hot liquid but it doesn't affect the taste. I would definitely recommend this product for any chai or coffee lover!
1;I'm a big fan of Dunkin Donuts vanilla chai so I was spending a fortune getting at least one a day. This chai mix is a very nice substitute once you fiddle with the directions a bit to make it to your individual taste (e.g. made with 1/2 water and 1/2 milk).I also find it especially appealing when it's made in a hot cocoa machine...comes out hot and frothy.
1;When in N.Y. visiting my sister she introduced me to amazon vanilla chi tea. We would have a cup every night before bed. It would be a relaxing time enjoying a good cup of tea and conversation. It is delivered to her door every couple months. Now I am back in Ks and have ordered it to be delivered on a regular schedule. Miss my sister and the conversation though.
1;"""I have been supplementing my Show Line German Shepherds with Olewo Red Beets since they were young. Olewo Red Beets provide great health benefits for my high energy dogs. They stay fit and maintain a suitable weight. People rave about their rich red and black coat colors. I am happy to provide my dogs with a natural food supplement that is high in antioxidants. """
1;"""Over the years I have tried making iced tea out of dozens of different herbal teas and most just end up tasting like lightly-flavored water.  This Yogi Sweet Thai Delight tea is the first I've tried that I will make again.  As a matter of fact"
1;I got this as a free sample and I couldn't believe how delicious it is. It sounded so strange so I had to try it right away. It wasn't spicy but had many layers of flavor. I don't even think there are chilis in it!
1;I love the Yogi brand of Chai tea...whether it's the Redbush or Green tea.  It has so much more flavor than other brands of Chai tea and I have tried a ton of varieties.  I like to make the tea strong and then add some soy milk to it to make it creamy.  It becomes a Chai Latte without all of the sugar you get from the Chai syrups used in coffee shops.  It's also good cold.
1;"""A colleague at work just gave me one of these tea bags.<br /><br />I like herbal teas but this one was really unique.<br />There were really nice lingering flavors on my tongue with every sip.<br />First"
1;"""This honey is delicious!  Wonderful range of flavors going very deep.  The jar says it was processed at a temperature not exceeding 115�.  It is a product of Brazil and certified organic by Oregon Tilth.  The jar also says:   This South American Honey is harvested by communities of bee keepers from Brazil.  Fear the killer bee"
1;"""These are excellent!  They travel quite well and are even tastier when left in the car to chill during the winter time. They are also awesome when car travelling across the Deep South and fresh green food is hard to come by!<br /><br />Highly addictive"
1;My fitness and health consultant highly recommended these bars.  Amazing grass bar is very fulfilling and not to mention packed with essential nutrition.  You can taste the delicious goodness from organic ingredients it contains.  You will not be disappointed!
1;"""I have two golden retrievers who can chew their way through any treat in no time...not so anymore!  The Everlasting Treat Toy (one for each with both side holding a treat) have lasted the kids for going on a week now.  They love the taste"
1;"""My kitties and I love this catfood. Had some problems with the boy kitty after neutering and he went off his food for over a week. He was wasting away. When he got back to having an appetite (no amount of treats or special foods would tempt him) he went back to chowing down on the GoodLife Recipe food"
1;"""We have 4 cats a little over 1 year old. We started out feeding them Blue Buffalo but they were always very gassy and 2 of the cats were getting plump.. while another was too skinny. So we ventured into trying other brands healthy or otherwise. They can be a bit picky but they eventually got used to anything.  Their  favorite was the Purina stuff... but that's just like us loving junk food isn't it...while the 1 skinny one did attain a normal weight the 2 plump ones became quite fat! So eventually we picked up this Goodlife brand"
1;"""My cats love this cat food.  It is the only cat food that I have ever used that they seem to digest well. There is seldom any  throw up  with this cat food.  Anyone who owns a cat knows what I mean about this.  I used to call my cats the  throw up queens  but since I've been using this cat food it very seldom happens.  They have been eating this cat food for over 2 years so I think this is a good test.  I highly recommend."""
1;I used to use the cheaper grocery store brands. Then two cats got very sick and I had no idea what was causing it. But I changed cat food anyway. They love this! AND they are healthy. It's made from all good food.
1;"""we have successfully been feeding our 2 cats this for about 6 months now comparing this brand to similar brand in this category I would say it exceeds all expectations it is not a high priced <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XKCCV2 >Blue Buffalo Indoor Cat Dry Food"
1;"""I got this so that my girls could have some variety in their meals. The nutritional value is great and they really scarf it up! They  helped  me open up the Amazon box when I brought it in the door. Since this is such a hit with them"
1;"""My cats were having so many digestive issues with other dry cat food. Let's just say the kitty litter was a lot messier than I wanted to clean up. This food is healthier than the other stuff in the store"
1;"""I tried the first packet of salsa mix the other day and made salsa for some friends coming over. Rave reviews all round! This salsa mix definitely has a bite to it which I really like. It was super easy to use"
1;Wonderful Walkers Premium 'traditional' Scottish Shortbread! Almost the same as my mother's home made Scottish Shortbread. This item was well worth the price for the size. Loved the tin too. Nice way the shortbread was packaged and sealed in individual portions. The shortbread did not last long however too good to not enjoy it with a good cup of tea.
1;First and for most 4.6 lbs of cookies is A LOT of cookies. There are 12 individual packages of cookies 3 of each type in a very nice large tin. Walkers cookies are always yummy and the cookies in this tin are no exception. I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who was amazing to me during a hospital stay. The tin is very sturdy and is tasteful in its decoration. This would make a perfect gift for any occasion!
1;"""This is a very flavorful tea. The pomegranate flavor comes through. It isn't as earthy as plain green tea.  It is fruity.  I don't feel like I'm missing anything a traditional tea bag has to offer. I've made green tea using whole leaf"
1;I keep about 6 tea's available at all times for myself and guests .. this is by far the best .. the pomegranate makes it sweet without sugar ..<br />I highly recomend it for both hot and iced tea .. and who doesn't love the K cups ! ??
1;"""i absolutely love these! they are a very strong ginger flavor and i love the texture of them.  i bought a 4 pack of rolls at whole foods and ate them in one day. and i wish i had more haha. low calorie and organic"
1;"""These are great tasting meat substitutes !!<br />What isn't great is that a 20-ounce can costs $18.58.  A 50-ounce can costs 11.55 !!!  Something is really messed up in the comparative pricing.<br /><br />Other than that"
1;This was my favorite meat substitute as a child and I still love them. My two vegetarian grandsons do also. They are good in casseroles as well as breaded and pan fried. They are supposed to simulate seafood but can be used as a substitute for chicken as well. I prefer now to buy the lower fat variety but will buy the classic Worthington Skallops if that is all that is avialable.
1;I never look any place for the hard to find things be spices books etc. It seems I always can find it on Amazon. Needless to say these white peppercorns are the best to cook white sauces and salads or anything that needs a soft touch.Thanks Amazon for finding these for me.
1;I stopped eating oreo cookies about twenty years ago or more. These are very good. All the organics and lack of assorted chemicals like High Fructose Corn Syrup and more make them safe to share with the children.
1;We bought the Roland Kalamata Halves (Barchetta) recently and I enjoy them everyday. The halves are easier to eat and easier to put on the pizza. They are very tasty. We signed up for the autoship program.
1;"""I used to order kalamata olives in small containers by the case through a food co-op.  Since retiring/downsizing and moving to a large city I do not have the storage space for case orders even when they are available.  However"
1;I usually buy whole pitted olives and when I bought this it was just as good.  It wasn't whole but the flavor was the way I liked it.  And usually the container is filled mostly with liquid but this one wasn't and it was wonderful.
1;"""I enjoy shopping in a local Fresh and Easy Market because they have so many and such unusual imported items. They're a British company and most of their imported stuff is from England. Take this Heinz Classic Cream of Tomato Soup. Supposedly it has been made and sold for over 100 years. Well"
1;Why don't more places sell this product?  I have a hard time finding it.  This stuff is DA BOMB!!!!  White sugar is no good for diabetics and that stuff they have for diabetics is nasty.A few kernels of this in your tea or coffee makes all the difference in the world.  I love it so I bought a case.  Very happy.  The price is reasonable too.
1;I'm new to the whole feed your pets GOOD food. This is a very good brand to start off with and you're able to buy this brand pretty much anywhere luckily. I go back and forth between MudBay and Petsmart depending on price. Yes its a bit expensive but its very much worth the buy!
1;Started feeding my two older dogs (12 and 13) this food. My lab has always had dry itchy skin. After a week on Avoderm he is shiny and not flaky at all! My german shepherd is usually picky over food but he loves Avoderm. I highly recommend this food. Packaging and expiration date were fine and I will definitely order from amazon instead of buying in a pet store. The price is way cheaper! Higher quality food really does make a difference in the health of your pets...I wish I had started feeding them Avoderm sooner.
1;Our new puppy loves AvoDerm Natural Chicken Meal & Brown Rice Formula Puppy Food. We have always bought AvoDerm for our cats and will continue to buy it for Scarlette. She even sneaks some of the cat food when we are not looking and Matilda (our Cat) allows it.
1;Individually packaged assorted rice crackers are really good.  I could without all the packaging.  Really great price for a high quality mix of rice crackers with some wasabi peas included.  I mixed with salted peanuts for a delicious snack.
1;"""I read some negative reviews on the Farmer's Market Pumpkin but I'm glad I gave it a try anyway.  I was shocked when the pumpkin arrived two days after I ordered it.  The cans are in perfect condition and the pumpkin is a beautiful color"
1;"""What can I say? If your looking at this item you most likely already know its a superior product. I was skeptical of buying this item due to the can condition complaints. It is actually cheaper for me to buy this on Amazon then my local grocer so I decided to try my luck. Each pack of twelve are as mentioned in other reviews"
1;"""I took a gamble ordering since I knew other people were receiving them badly dented.  Luckily mine came without a single dent.  They were packaged in a tight fitting box inside a bigger box with some of those air packets.  With the 50% off sale and subscribe and save discount"
1;"""I love this pumpkin. I have always looked for organic pumpkin but it is not sold locally. My shipment arrived in excellent condition and the product tastes great. I have begun to eat it regularly as part of my diet"
1;just had to issue a review asap.  just got my first order in the mail.  product packaged perfectly and arrived intact and not a dent anywhere.  it seems earlier reviews must have been heard by amazon b/c my packaging/product was terrific.  i have been trying to locate this item at an affordable price since a local organic grocer went out of business.  im in heaven.  the taste is terrific and now with subscribe and save i can get a regular supply and free shipping!!  totally healthy natural product that i use for all family (including my pets).  one more reason to love amazon!<br />!
1;"""I was thrilled to find this organic pumpkin for such a great price! I've had trouble finding canned pumpkin at local stores during the year so I thought it would be great to have so much.  It arrived very quickly and unlike other reviewers"
1;"""I bought this pumpkin because there is none available in our markets due to the great pumpkin crisis of 2009 or something equally drastic.  Its primary use is to prevent hairballs in my cat and it works.  I usually mix it with some canned cat food"
1;The awesome price and free shipping is what sold me.  I found this same exact pumpkin available for order from an organic grocery in NY and they wanted to charge over $30 for only 6 cans AND they only ship FedEX which is not cheap.  I couldn't believe my good luck to find the same exact item on Amazon and that I could get TWICE AS MUCH for $10 LESS with free shipping!!
1;"""I had been unable to find any canned pumpkin at any of the grocery stores in our area for months and found the Farmer's Market Foods canned pumpkin by searching online.  I order a lot of products through Amazon and have been very satisfied with everything I have ordered.  Like many of the other reviewers"
1;I've been eating pumpkin from the can for years. All it takes is a can opener and a fork (and unless you're from Maryland -- one should never use a spoon) and a bit of pepper.<br /><br />Yum! Pumpkin is my favorite edible gourd. Though I do miss the delicious pumpkin seeds you can get from fresh pumpkin. Sometimes I'll bake the seeds and throw a little sea salt on top. That's a nice treat on a cool Fall day. I'll make a steaming hot cup of tea and eat pumpkin seeds and just think about things out on my porch.<br /><br />I imagine that Susan Lucci and I are married and that she's very experimental in the bedroom and not afraid to invite company to join us. One time I imagined this so hard I blacked out. I woke on my porch with pumpkin all over my chest and a slight burn on my calf from the tea.
1;This is my second order and the cans arrived perfectly packed with no dents on any cans.  I am giving this to my basset hounds in hope of helping them with their anal glands issue.  But I may use some to make pumpkin muffins. My dogs love the puree in their food and I am glad to give them organic.  Although I don't think pumpkins are susceptible to pesticide spray since you dont eat the hard skin and the pesticide probably cannot penetrate the thick skin.
1;I use pumpkin in baking and for breakfasts year round for the taste and nutrition benefits. Going the organic route is SO much better than the stuff that predominates around the holidays. Just looking at the color of the pumpkin in the can you can see the organic is more natural. Farmer's Market is consistently good and buying it on Amazon is cheaper than getting it at Trader Joes or Whole Foods.
1;"""I buy canned pumpkins regularly because my cat craves for them. Used to buy these from Whole Foods but somehow they stopped filling the racks. You just can't buy other kinds of canned pumpkin with this kind of quality. It's not watery"
1;"""It frustrates me when I can't find canned pumpkin in my local grocery store.  It is part of my regular diet.  I ordered it from Amazon.com and got the same brand product at a very similar price.  With no shipping charges"
1;"""I purchase the Organic canned pumpkin for my dogs. Sounds funny but pumpkin is wonderful for dogs digestion. I have been feeding my dogs pumpkin for years. In the past 6 months it has been very hard to find 100% pumpkin in the stores so I started ordering it.<br /><br />It's also good for humans -- pumpkin pie is very healthy and low fat"
1;"""I bought this organic pumpkin online because it is impossible to find pumpkin locally. I feed my dogs this every day because it is wonderful for their digestion. Pumpkin was recommended by my vet.  All of the cans were in great condition. There were just a few minor dents on a few of the cans"
1;After reading about how many people received dented cans I was hesitant to buy these but I love pumpkin and after the massive crop failures it can't be found on any shelves anywhere! I'm glad I took the chance because all 12 cans arrived looking just perfect - no dents nor even scratches - just pure luscious pumpkin which will be pumpkin bars by tonight!
1;We were very pleased to locate this pumpkin on Amazon.  We have a dog with a very sensitive stomach.  We have included pumpkin with her meals for years but have not been able to find pumpkin in our local grocery stores and were told that there would be no canned pumpkin until Fall 2010.  Thanks for having this available.
1;My order was shipped and delivered promptly. The cans were in great condition- no dents on any of them. My dog is happy now and so am I because she enjoys pumpkin in her food. This is such a convenient way for me to purchase organic pumpkin.
1;"""Receive several dented cans - I have ordered this product several times.  It is wonderful to be used in animal diets.  I have been working with animals and it has been a life saver for many animals that I have helped<br />I believe that it would be unfair to fault the product or the manufacturer.  From what I understand from the UPS driver"
1;"""I use this to make  pumpkin pie-like  side dishes. If you just put about 25% of the sugar usually in a pumpkin pie and a graham cracker crust you have an extremely healthy and tasty dinner dish.<br /><br />Can't say much other than it is what I expected. I love pumpkin.<br /><br />As far as the reviews complaining about dented cans go... none of mine were dented"
1;"""Strong positives:<br /><br />Here is my assessment on buying 3 cases of this product as a cook:<br />1. This is a very strong value on an organic product<br />- Nearly 60% to my local Whole Foods<br /><br />2. Organic products don't act or cook like the mass produced brand but the difference is in the organic nature of these items.<br />- Our experience cooking for over 50 people and over 12 pies so far is they all tasted fine and didn't see any issues in consistency.<br /><br />3. Dented cans"
1;We were so thrilled to be able to order canned pumpkin online! You cannot find this product in any stores where we live! The vet wants us to add a tablespoon of pumpkin to our dogs food once or twice a day and we have been so frustrated that there is a shortage and we are not able to purchase it. We've ordered this a few times now and will continue to do so.
1;The organic pumpkin produced pies for Thanksgiving just as well as the national brand I have used for years. One of the cans was slightly dented in shipping. Acceptable as there is no organic pumpkin in the stores around here!
1;"""I use a lot of pumpkin.  I especially enjoy it mixed in my morning oatmeal and my little dog considers it a real treat.<br /><br />I was leery of purchasing this product because of the some of the negative reviews so after opening my first can of Farmer's Market Organic Canned Pumpkin"
1;"""I just received a shipment of Farmer's Market Pumpkin (12/15oz cans) and was very pleased with the condition of the cans.  Outside and inside cardboard cases were in excellent condition.  Of the 12 cans"
1;This canned pumpkin is a great value for organic.  Ive ordered theses twice so far.  I did find it to have a bit more liquid than Libby's so I usually reduce the liquid or oil in my recipes a bit.  I will continue to order these at the right price!
1;"""Okay I read all the reviews before purchasing and debated on buying because all the complaints about dented cans.  My order arrived and I had about 6 dented cans.  I've already used the worst of the dented cans and the pumpkin was fine.  It tasted great.  I highly recommend.  People make a big deal about dented cans but unless they're punctured"
1;"""This pumpkin product arrived in good condition and is all that was available after the almost year-long shortage due to Libby pumpkin running out during the 2009 holiday season. My dogs get pumpkin with each meal to help with their digestive system working properly and it works great. Thanks to Farmer's Brand for having enough product to fill our needs. It is more expensive to order online"
1;I was worried after ordering this product since so many reviews complained about dented cans but I ordered when the price was right and took the chance. Out of 12 cans only one was dented. The expiration date on the cans I received: 2014. Very happy with the quality of this pumpkin.
1;"""I ordered this recently when it when I noticed the price dropped to $1.23 a can on Subscribe and Save.  I'd hesitated ordering in the past because of the issues with dented cans in some earlier reviews but couldn't resist trying it at that price.  I was pleasantly surprised to get a case of perfect cans that were packed in a reinforced box. The expiration date is 2014 which makes them fresh. I wish I'd ordered more!<br /><br />The consistency of the pumpkin itself has also been good"
1;"""I actually got this for my cat! And she loved it!!! For a week.... ha<br /><br />Well I was amazed that she was interested in it at all but now I've got a whole lot of pumpkin on my hands.<br /><br />It looks"
1;I brought this product b/c the FOB my husband is at in Afghanistan doesnt have monster and he loves them so much mine does but i couldnt ship to him from my FOB so i searched and this was the best deal it didnt take very long to get out here to him. none of the cans were damaged in shipping everything was great.
1;"""I've also tried and love many energy drinks and the Green Monster cannot be beat.  The 300mg of Ginseng along with the 2gms of protein building blocks (amino acids) and the 2000gm  Energy Blend  all wrapped in the green pixie-stick flavor is spectacular<br /><br />RockStar"
1;I've ordered this tea about 3 times before and will order it again.  I first had this tea at a Chinese restaurant and can only find it online.  I don't like black tea and not a fan of green tea so this oolong tea is just right.  I don't make it really strong so I steep it for about 3 1/2 minutes and it's good to drink.
1;I bought this for my Father's 90th Birthday and he enjoyed it so much he REFUSED to share it with any other family members. The cookies came very quickly and packaged quite well. I would recommend this cookie to anyone who enjoys shortbread or has a sweet tooth.
1;This is another of Marshall's products where you control the taste and the flavor is the greatest out there.  No salt products from them are the greatest for the knowledgeable cook or the amateur whom can add a little or more salt to their taste.
1;"""I actually love this seasoning. The no-salt factor is great as it allows you to control the amount of salt you wish to add to anything when you use this spice. I used it in a taco soup I make and it tasted wonderful. Here's the thing about spice mixes: you may find something missing flavor-wise due to your own tastes/expectations. However"
1;"""I absolutely love the taste of this tea and so does everyone else I've encouraged to try some (even my coffee drinking daughter).  I drink a lot of herbal teas and this is definitely my favorite.  I can't tell if it's really detoxifying my liver and kidneys"
1;My husband both love the taste of this tea and my daughter came over and I gave her a cup and she asked me the name of it. She doesn't usually ask that. I save a dollar a box over the grocery store price where I buy my groceries. Good deal- Great taste. I  like Yogi teas in general.
1;"""I've been drinking this tea now for 3 weeks straight. The first weeks I was only drinking in the morning after my workouts and it really helped boost my energy in the morning and was a great part of my morning breakfast. I also notice that my skin cleared up really nicely. I've never had problem skin but it is smoother now than ever before so I believe the detoxing benefits are kicking in. This last week"
1;"""I have used this products off and on for several years. I decided to test trial this and use it every day for 30 days. I decided to make an iced tea verson of it sweetened with stevia. I love it. I make a 1/2 gallon every day and drink it. I have not changed my diet. What I have noticed is that I feel better"
1;I JUST bought this tea today after reading all about it. It started with reading about Jillian Michaels water mixture that had dandelion root tea in it and I came across the yogi tea. I figured I'd give it a go from the good reviews. Although I can't say anything about the detoxing effects as I haven't used it long enough...I can say the taste is just fine. I am not typically a herbal or licorice liking person. I usually hate the taste. This tea isn't bad at all. I brewed it in a small amount of hot water then made it into iced tea (it's still hot out!) Didn't add sugar or anything which I typically do and I think it's bearable for sure. I'll come back when I've drank it a few weeks and with hope I feel as fabulous as the other commenter's here :)
1;I've been enjoying this tea for several years.  It is refreshing and has the added bonus of reducing bloating.  I work in a public area and people comment on how great the tea smells. Highly recommended.
1;"""I've been drinking Yogi tea for a few years and finally got tired of paying the high price at the local supermarket.<br /><br />Glad I found this stuff on Amazon for less than half price!<br /><br />The first box I received was labeled DeTox"
1;My kid loves it. I put some ice cubes in a blender...took the crushed/pulverized cubes out and put them in a glass ...added a little of this blue raspberry mix and voila!!!!!! I made it for him 2 times so far.... I def recommend this item.
1;Best Chai tea west of Mumbai - spice combination could not be better. Not too strong yet very flavorful - best spice combination in the USA - I think I have tried every brand sold and this is the best.
1;"""I had tried Wabash Vally Farms popcorn before and sought out a place where I could purchase it online.  I can sometimes find it in my area and but only in small quantities.  This is by far the best popcorn with few unpopped kernels"
1;"""This brought memories back to me of a time gone by when my parents raised strawberry shaped popcorn in our vegetable garden. I didn't think it was still grown! If some one out there would like to try it"
1;First experience with Wabash Valley Farms popcorn and it is great. Ordered purple and the baby white at the same time. The purple is superior to the baby white in my estimation. Almost hulless. Very tender. Will order again.
1;I really like these small bowls - they are the perfect size to toss in the overnight bag for a short trip. Pop it in the hotel's microwave for a small dinner and you've saved $5 to $10 that you would have wasted eating out. At home in 60 seconds you have a snack or meal on the run that tastes good and requires zero effort with zero cleanup afterward. I have just gotten into the habit of always keeping some of these around for visiting kids as well.
1;"""I bought these to try to get my girls to eat them instead of sugary junk food.  To set a good example I ate one first.  wow!  My girls never got a chance to try them.  I blew through them 2/day.  they are great the way the are"
1;This was a great deal for only 8 bucks!<br /><br />It was shipped way before Amazon subscribed said it would be and arrived to my son's campus on the very day the scam of a college meal plan ended.<br /><br />My son isn't a big fan of Chef Boyardee ravioli but i don't care..<br /><br /> i told him he better pretend it's tiny empanadas with sauce and eat it or continue to starve until u get a J O B and able to buy your own food.<br /><br />Personally I enjoy Chef Boyardee ravioli with cheese.
1;WE RUN A CATERING AND EVENTS COMPANY AND USE THESE MOSTY FOR CHILDRENS PARTIES...THEY ARE EASY TO SERVE AND THE CHILDREN LOVE THE BOYARDEE PRODUCTS. WE CANT GET THEM FROM ANY SUPPLIER FOR WHAT AMAZON SELLS THEM FOR IN THE SUBSCRIBE&SAVE PROGRAM...AND THEY TASTE GOOD AS WELL.
1;"""I have used this product for several years. I am diabetic and needed the additional immune system boost especially in the Winter time. Nobody wants cold or flu and I found that if I used this if I even thought I was getting sick it almost stopped it in it's tracks.  Sometimes I got a little achy from a cold but the cold did not last as long  nor was it as severe as it was without the tea.  My BF uses it now too"
1;Bought this tea for the elderberry included not expecting the best taste.  Found that the taste is excellent!  I have changed my choice of evening drink from decaf coffee to this great tasting tea.  Even my wife has started drinking this instead of her morning coffee.
1;i had a terrible cold and a patient of mine had given me a yogi tea for colds --- took me days before i tried it and when i did i absolutely loved it! so i went on their website and found a whole array of teas they offer. i didn't have an idea where to find it first so i checked out whole foods just because i know that the tea is organic and we all know that whole foods only sells organic stuff. i bought a box of triple echinacea for more than $4! i didn't care at that time for the price but as i googled this tea i found out great websites where i could order this from and lo and behold i just subscribed to amazon's auto-delivery. although now i only drink this particular one twice a day --- one in the morning and one before i go to bed --- not only it supports my immune system but it also warms my tummy in the morning! i highly recommend this tea to anyone who is a tea drinker and even for those who have not tried it...it has a wonderful aroma and its very soothing to the throat as well...
1;We have tryed other gravy mixes and nothing compares to Jimmy Dean's.  Others just don't have the flavor.  Since we can't buy it at any of the stores in our town I will continue to order it from Amazon.
1;it is the only  gravy my husband will eat and it had begun to look like walmaart had ceased to carry it.  I typed  the name in and it led lme to amazon.com.  we are thrilled to have it again on our shelf.
1;"""Delicious!! Yes it's just like drinking liquid Atomic Fireball candy.  I should say  sip  since I CAN'T<br />take a swallow. It would blow my head off. So much caffiene it gives me a headache if I drink it too<br />fast! This will wake you up! Wish I could find a local source. I'll be getting much more of this."""
1;"""These little treats pack a powerful punch.  The  peppery  taste is just the beginning.  They're not too sweet and don't leave you thirsty.  I keep them in my purse for a quick pick me up.  Besides the taste and convenience they make me feel better! Ginger is known for it's effect on ones' immune system."""
1;"""My family likes Crystal Light and we drink it to lower our calorie consumption and avoid drinking so many soft drinks.  This is pretty good ice tea with just enough peach flavor to make it unique.<br /><br />It contains no sugar"
1;I love this Crystal Light ICED TEA PEACH but can no longer find it in my grocery stores. So the other day I ordered it online and maybe because they were out they sent a substitute. They sent Iced Teac Peach MANGO....Gad...that's not what I wanted but I will keep it because I hate the idea of returning it.  So please send me the ICED TEA PEACH as shown in your picture. Thanks
1;"""The peach flavored tea is one of my family's favorites. The peach taste is just right--not too strong or syrupy tasting. There is also no chemical taste as sometimes happens with artificially sweetened drinks.<br /><br />This is really easy to make. I just pour two packs into a large pitcher"
1;"""I had begun having trouble finding Crystal Light Peach Tea in grocery stores so again I tried Amazon and was a bit surprised to find it there.  My family just loves Peach Tea and when this batch runs out"
1;I really love crystal light peach tea.  It is easy to make and has the most natural peach flavor that I have found.  I like to use a little less water than it calls for.  It makes it stronger tasting.  I had to search stores to find it and now I am getting it sent to me from amazon on a monthly schedule.
1;First - The description is WRONG for ingredients. Stubbs does not use high fructose corn syrup in their products. They use all natural ingredients. All Stubb's products are Gluten Free. They are all amazing. We just put a pork roast in the crockpot and pour the pork marinade over it and let it cook all night. It's amazing. The prices on here are high. Walmart sells all Stubb's products for $2.50 each but if you can't find what you want I guess you have to pay these high prices. Still they are worth every penny. We also use the beef marinade all the time with beef short ribs in the crockpot and the herbal mustard rub. I use that on my tofu scramble with lots of curry powder. The mustard rub goes great with curry. The bbq sauces are great too!
1;I LOVE this drink mix and even mix it into plain NF Greek Yogurt.  I'm never without it.  Stores don't seem to want to carry it going into the Fall and Winter months so I was quite thankful to find it on Amazon.  Thank you!
1;This product is great!!!  Makes you drink water more often.  Walgreens was selling the 50 pk for $5.00 but discontinued selling.  WHY?!  The 8pk can be purchased for $1.00.  So why is this retailer selling a 12 count for $32.50 or $2.70 per 8 pk box?  You can buy 12 boxes yourself and pay $12.00.  The math isn't adding up.<br />Anywho....Still I think this an innovative product designed to make water good to drink with only 5 calories.
1;"""My husband and I have enjoyed good coffee for over 25 years.  We're always trying new coffee and our favorite bean has been Sumatra up until now.  We tried Zoka's Colonel Fitzroy a couple month's ago and immediatley decided it was our new favorite.  It's similar to a Sumatra"
1;"""I personally know several people who recently tried this new 100 percent mangosteen juice. The juice is  Mangosteen Queen  sold at the mangosteenjuice.ws that is similar to the Dynamic Health Gold mangosteen.<br /><br />These individuals report higher energy levels probably due to sleeping better and disappearance of pains they have had prior to drinking these type of mangosteen juices.<br /><br />One even received comments of looking ten years younger without soliciting for it.<br /><br />I for one lost my suceptibility to allergy due to pollen in the fall"
1;Taste isn't everything and this stuff doesn't taste that great but it works and I'm grownup enough to understand the difference. It costs a little less through Amazon but you have to pay shipping. It costs a little more direct and you have to pay tax in California but if you buy 2 or more bottles the shipping is free.
1;This cheesecake is the best.  I sent several orders to all my family all over the country for Thanksgiving and even ordered one for myself.  Everyone raved about it.  Good value and excellent product.  Would definitely order again.
1;I was a little nervous about giving this as a gift imaging all the horrible things that could go wrong but I was pleasantly surprised. The package was delivered quickly everything was fresh and tasty I would definitely buy again.
1;I LOVE Love Grown! .... I bought the variety pack so that I could try all the flavors and was really bummed to see that I would be receiving two of the regular flavored granola in the package. I didn't want something boring and flavorless---I was shocked when their regular oat granola was fantastic! Each flavor is delicious in its own way! .... I'm in love!
1;"""this product gives those of us who do not eat refined sugars a way to incorporate a natural sweetness in our cereals and salads.  It is a product that is true to the mango taste but it is not too sour and not too sweet"
1;My dog loves these and they are the perfect size so he can have a few a day. One of my favorite things about fruitables is that they smell good! They don't make my dog's breath smell weird or my hands after I give them to him. This was my first time buying this flavor and my dog loves them. I also recommend the apple/bacon (same skinny mini size) and pumpkin/apple (larger sized treats).
1;"""This is amazing bread. I made it for Christmas and I have to say this is the most delicious and moist pumpkin bread I have ever had. Unfortunately it seems to be seasonal. I actually went back and bought 10 more kits to clean out what the store had left.<br /><br />The kit comes with icing"
1;"""I bought two boxes of these jelly beans as they were the closest thing you can buy (at a reasonable price) to the Harry Potter  Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans . I bought two boexes because I thought there'd only be 20 beans in a box but in fact there must have been at least 40. We had way too many left over. The kids got a huge kick out of daring eachother to try one. Shipping was fast and included in these $6/box jelly beans."""
1;"""I challenge anyone to find this product in this container at this great prices anywhere on the internet!  Great job Amazon! Only advertising wording I would change would be the word  unit  to container! It wasn't clear if you would be getting a bag of seasoning or what. It comes in the handy plastic container."""
1;this is a great seasoning. it adds flavour to food and presents an option that is healthy. with no msg or salt it is a great and healthy way to spice up all the meals in a household. will reccommend it to anyone.
1;"""I really enjoy using  Mrs. Dash Original Blend .  Great to find in institutional size because I always use more than the recommended serving size of 1/4 teaspoon. It seems I always have this on my grocery list in the 2.5oz size so I purchased two bottles hoping it would last a while.  Mrs. Dash is a marvelous product for those who are on a low sodium diet because it adds a lot of flavor to meals.  When I run out I will definitely purchase the large size again.<br /><br />I am very happy with my purchase.  I am also beholden to the reviewer who stated this product comes in a bottle."""
1;If you have uses for Mrs. Dash -- and who doesn't? -- this jumbo size is the way to buy it. I use gobs in sauces and marinades. The 21-oz bottle stores well in the freezer and I take out smaller quantities for daily use.
1;"""I put these on a Nordic Ware Beehive cake I baked for Rosh Hashanah last year for a centerpiece cake.  Everyone commented how cute the bees were.  I stuck some of them on toothpicks with a little cake frosting so some of them appeared to be flying around the hive.  I ordered them again for this year's apple cake centerpiece.  The bees face different directions so I put a pair in the doorway  kissing .  Beautiful addition to our holiday table."""
1;"""The sugar bees came exactly as described and well packaged so NONE were broken when the arrived!  These were great for my son's 2nd birthday cake. He is crazy about Bee Movie and I couldn't bring myself to spend a load on a bday cake from the grocery store"
1;I Love Pro Pac Foods.  A great food that my picky dogs love.  I raise Corgis in Indiana and really like the fact that not only do the foods have no out of country ingredients but are locally obtained and made.  My dogs like it much better than Science Diet.
1;We LOVE this stuff around my house.  I finally got my husband to switch from his sugary sports drinks to a healthy option.  His favorite is the Pink Guava.  I like it because it has a ton of potassium and other minerals that hydrate me well which is important as I am a full time fitness instructor.  It also satisfies my sweet cravings without being sugary or doing crazy things to my blood sugar.  I'm sure kids will love it as well.  A much better option than a Sunny whatever juice box.  It is perfect for a packed lunch.  FIVE STARS! I'd give it more if I could.  The Mango flavor of this brand is also wonderful and the unflavored is a favorite as well.  I enjoy it more than other brands (and I've tried quite a few).  O.N.E. is by far my favorite.
1;"""Trying to feed a gluten free 6 year old boy is not always easy.  This is the only bread mix that I have found that I can acutally make sandwiches with!  He loves it as toast and if I cut the center and cut a little thicker slice"
1;I don't know what they are putting in this dog food that keeps my dogs from getting bored but they have been eating this brand daily for almost a year.  They love it. The repeat delivery option is great.  Haven't had to go to the store to get dog food at the last minute for a long time.
1;This product is very rich and delicious. It adds a wonderful traditional flavor to our our gluten/grain free waffles and pancakes. It's about a 1/3rd of the price here on amazon.com than it is at stores for this size container too. It lasts long in this house since we only use a pinch at a time but a little goes a long way! That's why we happily chose the auto-ship option too.
1;I have been trying many different brands and types of maple syrup because my family loves homemade waffles and pancakes and Coombs Organic Grade B is the best so far. The Grade B has a richer flavor than Grade A. It may be a little pricey but keep in mind that it lacks all of the chemicals and additives. It's just pure maple syrup!
1;I FIND THE GRADE B BETTER FOR PANCAKES...I BOUGHT A BEFORE AND RATHER TASTELESS.  I'LL BUY AGAIN.  I SENT AT CHRISTMAS TIME WITH THE PANCAKE MIX AND IT WAS A TREAT FOR MY FAR AWAY FRIEND AND PRACTICAL.
1;"""this maple syrup is so rich in flavor-this is truly grade B maple syrup<br />the price is much better than in a specialty grocery store as well<br />the texture thickens in consistency if you keep it refrigerated"
1;I tried the Costco Grade A Maple Syrup versus the Coombs Grade B and the Coombs is way better.  It almost taste like molasses.  It's very good and I'd highly recommend it.  I'm using it for the Master Cleanse with lemons and cayenne pepper and it makes it taste way better than the Grade A.
1;"""I admit that for many years I only liked the  bad  stuff in the grocery store that was chock full of high fructose corn syrup and didn't have maple syrup in it!  I just liked the flavor.  Other maple syrups (which were Grade A) just tasted watery to me and didn't have that rich flavor I wanted.<br /><br />But since we're trying to eat healthier now and getting rid of stuff with HFCS in it I wanted to find a syrup that tasted really good.  And I've found it!<br /><br />This syrup is really flavorful"
1;Coombs maple syrup rocks.  I have been a huge fan since discovering it while visiting Vermont years back.  It was yummy then and continues to be yummy now.  The price was awesome for this quality product.
1;I started subscribing to this syrup this summer as a replacement for my usual Nature's Promise syrup.  I'll admit it took me a little while to get used to because the taste and consistency are very different form the Nature's Promise (NP).<br /><br />Consistency<br />Coombs is thicker than NP which allows me to pour a thin and controlled stream onto my waffles. I don't like to drown my waffles. I do tend to lose a small amount of syrup onto the edge of the container but I think that must happen with all syrups.<br /><br />Flavor<br />I think the flavor is a little stronger than Nature's Promise. Maybe more than a little stronger.  I'll admit at first I liked Nature's Promise better but I just had to get used to the stronger flavor of Coombs.  Now that I have I can't go back.  And I even tried just out of curiosity.  NP is tasteless when compared to Coombs.  Coombs is a perfect compliment to my whole grain waffles.  Just the right amount of maple flavor and sweetness which allows me to also taste the waffles.<br /><br />Bottle<br />I like the bottle.  The extra unopened bottle sits on a small wooden kitchen cart with some other things and it looks good. Seems to fit in.  Of course you have to refrigerate the opened bottle.  It's easy to use. It has a small handle that I think can fit most people's index finger comfortably. Then you grab the skinny neck with your thumb and middle finger.  It really seems to be very ergonomic.  Very easy to pour.<br /><br />Value<br />When subscribing it's like getting a free bottle of Nature's Promise for every two 32 oz bottles I get.  And because I can easily control the pour I can make one bottle last about two months and that is using it almost every day.<br /><br />Great product.  I highly recommend.
1;I ordered product and not all was shipped out. The company shipped half and half later. I recieved it so quickly I was surprised. I will be ordering from them aganin in the future.... Thanks Great Job<br />Chris
1;"""There's maple syrup and there's maple syrup. My wife and I are from the East Coast (she from Vermont) and we've tried maple syrup from other regions and those just don't measure up to a Vermont syrup. Although this product does say some of the raw materials come from Canada"
1;"""This is amazing syrup.  You have to watch the price though.  It fluctuates on Amazon quite a bit.  I bought this when it as offered on a buy one get one free deal.  Two bottles for $26!  Better deal than I can find locally.  Works great on waffles"
1;I have been using Grade B Maple Syrup for about 6 years now. I love the Coombs Family Organic one the best because of its rich flavor and a affordable price. It is great to see a company who does not charge arm and a leg for such a good organic product!
1;"""One of the other reviewers explained how Grade B Maple Syrup means that it has gone through the refinement process twice instead of once as Grade A does.  It's so much thicker and mapleier than the Grade A I'm used to buying from stores here in Oregon"
1;Spend a little extra money and get the real stuff...and quite honestly you will never go back to that stuff that pretends to be maple syrup.<br />Grade B is what we prefer in my household because of the stronger maple taste.<br />Amazon has wonderful sales on this product which makes it much more affordable. Believe me when I say...ditch your fake maple syrup and go for the real stuff.
1;This grade B maple syrup was delicious!  It seems thicker and has a fuller flavor than the Grade A.  We will definately purchase from Coombs Family Farms again.  These would make wonderful Christmas gifts.
1;I thought I new what good Maple Syrup tasted like.  I was never too impressed with the brands we found in our local grocery stores. This is much thicker and has a stronger maple flavor.  One reviewer said it has more minerals than grade A.  That could account for the more complex flavor.  Perhaps it is because it is organic.  I am sold on this brand.  I was hesitant to buy online because of reviewers saying the caps cracked causing leaks. Since it now comes with Frustration free packaging I do not have to worry about that anymore.  I am a believer!
1;"""I bought this Maple Syrup based on the reviews of this product and I am very pleased.<br /><br />In the past I had always purchased Grade A Maple Syrup at the market. I was not even<br />aware of a Grade B. However"
1;"""This is some of the most delicious and authentic tasting maple syrup we've come across. My 3 year old loves to have it with milk - he calls the whole drink  Maple Syrup   - thats how much he likes it. The stuff they sell at costco feels like sugar water compared to this product. You will not be disappointed!"""
1;"""This is a good quality syrup and my least favorite of the 3 I've tried.  It is very sweet when compared with the other 2 that I've tried.  I typically don't like things very sweet.  If you like sweetness"
1;"""Wonderful flavor. Grade B is richer and darker than Grade A which is lighter tasting. The price on Amazon is comparable to non-organic elsewhere. We never use the grocery store type syrups as they are mainly sugar. This must be kept refrigerated.<br /><br />I often make cleansing drinks either with raw organic apple cider vinegar mixed with a bit of maple syrup or the lemon (I usually use key limes or limes as I like them better than lemons)"
1;Great stuff! Although I'm a major Maple lover for starters.<br /><br />The Grade B is darker and more flavorful as far as I'm concerned and the entire family enjoys it.<br /><br />Reasonably priced in a larger bottle for bigger families.
1;I ordered this syrup after my daughter started in on her pancake kick.  Every single day for breakfast she wants pancakes and I did not want her eating that nasty corn syrup grocery store pancake syrup.  This stuff is delicious and has a beautiful color.  I like that it is organic and from a family farm.  I will continue to buy this product again and again!
1;We use a lot of Organic Maple Syrup and this was a brand recommended and Amazon Subscribe and Save had the best per ounce price!  I love not having to think about stocking up on items I buy all the time!
1;I had been buying from a local retail store but they changed to a new brand so I ordered from amazon WOW what a great flavor this has  grade b is richer I think..only problem is 1 is gone already cause the kids tried it and love it. didnt need to worry with the other brand I was using lol ...ty for making this syrup available ..shipping was fast which is good  im almost out ...michael
1;"""I agree this tastes like the Trader Joe version that I can't believe they discontinued.  It is the best sauce and I keep finding some new way to use it. I'm eating less & less meat but I know it tastes great on veggie burgers"
1;"""John Cope's Dried Corn has been a tradition in our family for generations.  My Grandmother was from PA and moved to Newfoundland Canada in the 1920's.  Our American relatives have been keeping us supplied since then"
1;I have used CET chews for years as I worked at a vet. They work great to keep your dogs teeth in good shape if you can't brush their teeth. Make sure to only use them once daily and the chlorhexidine coating them will work to keep their teeth as pearly white as possible! And these were about 1/2 the price they are at a regular veterinarian.
1;"""I give these to both of my lab-mix mutts every other day & their teeth look great! One of them had slight-to-medium tartar build up around his molars and they look much improved.  (They also eat dry food and not wet which helps).  It doesn't do much for their breath however"
1;This is a great value.  The C.E.T. chews are a great alternative to raw hide since they dissolve.  I would recommend this item from this vendor to anyone...try pricing these chews at the Vet's office and you'll see why.
1;These chews are great. My dog loves them. They really keep his teeth clean and greatly improve his breath. This is an outstanding product at excellent price. Do your dog a favor and get buy these chews. Your dog will thank you every day.
1;our vet dentist recommended these as part of a daily routine to help manage one of our dogs dental problem and mean we can spread out his frequently dental cleanings a little more.  He also said they are softer and won't break teeth.  I have 2 labs and they love these.  I don't let them eat them on carpet as I think they would stain.  So far they have really helped.
1;I treat my dogs to one of these large CET Hextra chews daily. They love them and at two years (today remarkably) their teeth are as white as when babies. I have used these for about 18 months and buy them a dozen bags at a time - usually from Amazon. I get the XC-Large 30 count and expect to pay about 16 buck.<br /><br />Make your dog happy and treat him to a white smile.<br />Troy
1;"""These Cet Hextra Premium chews are the best thing to come along since toothbrushes for K-9s.<br /><br />I have 8 Australian Shepherds and brushing their teeth regularly does NOT happen around here.  We have over 100 other animals and its too bad we can't give them to ALL.<br /><br />When you open the package"
1;great chews. Dogs love the flavor so they keep on CHEWING. we have 3 shelties and they love the taste. they usually snub other chews. The chews also keep the tartar on their teeth to a minimum. not your typical chew. worth the cost. will save you on having your dogs teeth professionally cleaned.
1;Our Vet first suggested trying them to improve Cuz's breath....to say his breath was bad was being kind.<br /><br />But since trying his first bag of chews....it was discovered that he really loves them and believe it or not his breath is greatly improved!!!!<br /><br />Now I order them in bulk..... Got run....got to order some more!<br /><br />Nick Hopkins
1;"""I would definitely reccomend these for your dog.  My dogs love their taste and think they're getting a treat when they get these.  I also save money by buying the biggest size and cutting them in half.<br /><br />Here's our tale.  My dog Babe is 11 yrs old.  3 years ago at her annual check-up the vet reccomended we have her teeth cleaned (this means anesthesia).  We were busy so we scheduled her appointment 2 months out. The new dog foods with teeth brushing had just come out in our area so we switched her to one.  When we took her in for the teeth cleaning"
1;These CET Hextra Prem Chews are super for all my dogs and I have 6 small to medium sized house dogs. They last and last for a good long time chewing and cleaning of my dogs teeth. I get the Ex-large ones and cut them in two pieces each for my pets. This makes them more economical for me to buy. My dogs love them.
1;My dogs LOVE these chews.  These chews once or twice a week in conjunction with high quality (I use Wellness) dry dog food keeps their teeth healthy.  I strongly recommend these for large dogs (75 lbs) or higher
1;My two Golden Retrievers have been devouring the CET HEXtra Premium Chews for two years.  These chews have cut down the number of dental cleanings and they just love the chews.  I am really happy with the results.
1;"""i have two medium sized mutts and buy the extra-large chews to cut up into smaller pieces (some can be cut with scissors but some are too thick and must be sawed). the dogs love them and they each get a piece as their nighttime snack. they still do get plaque and tartar but i imagine without these chews the buildup would be much faster. also"
1;Our dogs have been using this product for about a year now.  We use to buy them from our vet until they didn't have the large size one month and I check Amazon and I've been ordering them from Amazon ever since (cheaper too).  The vet had been after me to have the dogs teeth cleaned but now marvels at how clean my 10 year old Fox Terrier's teeth have become... and our two year old golden retriever's are the same.  Give them one a day (the large size cut in half) in the morning after they eat.
1;I have been buying these for my dog for a few years.  She has had excellent dental<br />checkups and no gum disease. I highly recommend this product.  It is rather pricey but it still beats getting a dental cleaning from the vet. The only issue I have with them is that the size of the chews are not uniform -- most are of the expected size but some are not really extra large.
1;"""The C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral Hygiene Chews with Chlorhexidine are super fantastic! Just ask my dogs! Buy the correct size for you dog and it will keep him/her busy for a while and will keep their teeth/gums healthy as well.  If your dogs are small (12-lbs and under) I'd recommend the  petite  size because they are made from  pressed  hide and are easier for them to digest.  My dog is 75-lbs and she needs the Extra Large ones.  We've been huge fans of HEXtra Chews for several years.  Do you and your dog a favor and keep them on hand!"""
1;"""We've been giving these chews to our dobies for at least the last four years.  Our (now) older dog had a dental cleaning and we started giving these chews about a week later.  The vet has never recommended a cleaning since.  We have a new pup (almost two years old now) and he still has super-model teeth thanks to these chews.  They do seem expensive"
1;I can't speak for my pet but she seems to love C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral Hygiene Chews<br /> and I see a noticable improvement of her teeth.  I will order again as I love the ease of ordering and having them delivered directly to my home.
1;Have been using it for a 2 months. I must say that my dog needed a dental clean up with the build up that was leading to sore gums. In a few months of using it my dog's problem was gone. My dog's vet also agreed and was much surprised.<br /><br />I am continuing to give this to my 100 lbs lab who happily chews this down. This is now the only dental product my dog will get.
1;"""Our Saint Bernard is 4 yrs. old and has always turned his nose up to rawhide or similar type chews.  Trying to brush his teeth is always a challenge.  A woman at the vets office (who had the same issues with her dogs)"
1;I've been buying this product for a few years - paying way too much because I didn't know Amazon carried it!!  My dog's teeth are in great condition b/c of them and he loves them.  My vet agrees.<br />So glad I discovered that Amazon has them.
1;I have used this product for my Vizsla since he was a puppy. At the age of 6 1/2 because of this product he has very white and clean teeth without being brushed. This is also a special treat as whenever he is left home alone he gets a chew.  He senses when we are leaving and will stand by his treat table waiting for his chew.  I highly recommend this product.
1;My dogs love the Virbac chewies. Both these and the regular kind. It helps to keep thier teeth and breath fresh.  I have two big Labs and they don't chew on anything except these (and my socks).  I would highly recommend them to anyone!
1;I have taken Goji Berries for several years now. I used to buy them from Whole Foods. The price and quality here are a great value. I will definitely be purchasing more from this stellar. I take them daily and feel better for it. 100% recommend.
1;Bought these before at a local health store that closed.  Decided to try online and was pleasantly pleased with the price and I just love to have jello with this things in it for a little extra pep.  I was really surprised how quickly they arrived.
1;I drink an all-organic raw fruit and veggie smoothie every morning and I add the goji berries.  I will order this again as I am almost out.  I am into superfoods and I love this for my immune system and have gotten a Grade A health report from my doctor.  I will never make a smoothie without this superfood.
1;Things I love about this product:<br />-Only 1 gram of sugar per serving<br />-Tastes great<br />-Made with decaffeinated chocolate<br />-Only 21 calories<br /><br />It's great for both kids and adults who love chocolate milk but want something healthier. It tastes like ovaltine to me and that just makes it even better!
1;This product is wonderful! My kids love it because it tastes like a chocolate drink and it is loaded with healthy vegetables and nutrients.<br />I was so glad to find a way to get some extra vegetables in their daily diet and mine as well. It is also easy to fix-just add water and stir for a few seconds and there you are!
1;"""I have been using this product for the last 6 months with my 20 month old toddler.  We do not use it in her milk or water because she likes drinking them but we do use this product with her plain yogurt and with her 8 grain hot cereal.  She loves it!  Chocolate yogurt and oatmeal"
1;My toddler rarely eats vegetables so giving him this mixed in his milk makes us both feel better!  I love that the chocolate is decaffeinated and that there is only one gram of sugar per serving compared to ten or twenty grams per serving in some other chocolate milk mixes.
1;I have been using this protein mix for several years even though I'm not a kid anymore (just at heart!) I love the taste - the list of ingredients is amazing and you will NOT find a better price anywhere than Amazon
1;My kids seriously think this is chocolate milk.  I can smell the difference but they love it.  My almost 2 year old got the cup from her brother and got in MAYBE 2 sips and the whole day her tummy was messed up after that.  So I wouldnt give it to the little ones.  But my older 2 love it.
1;"""I am a college student of health sciences and the mother to a 3 yr old toddler. I personally show very little response to  placebo effect  situations and I am a true skeptic at heart. I originally found the  kid  version of this product for my daughter while searching for something to boost her immune system. I spent hours on the computer researching the ingredients of these products. I decided to try the adult version for myself and I can honestly say that the Amazing Grass Superfood Powders have made a huge improvement in both of our lives.<br /><br /> My daughter attends daycare and with that setting comes frequent colds/flus"
1;"""I originally bought this for my 3 year old who is very picky about textures in her food/drinks and will go days without eating anything but milk. When I found this I thought it would be great because she loves chocolate milk and this is highly nutritious so I ordered it. When I made a cup of this with milk it seemed like it needed more chocolate flavor so I added ovaltine and it was delicious. So I hid it in a sippy cup so she wouldn't see the tiny green particles floating on top and I didn't tell her anything was different about it but as soon as she started drinking it she started gagging and cried  I don't like this seedy chocolate milk! <br /><br />Not wanting to waste it my husband and I have been drinking it. We have both noticed that when we drink it we feel really good all day! So if your child doesn't have a problem with textures then I think this product would be great for you!"""
1;Seriously the best lollipops you will ever taste! Makes great gifts for others as well as yourself. Someone brought them into my workplace and I have been addicted ever since. I usually crave an afternoon sweet and they are a perfect yummy afternoon snack.
1;I ordered these Lemonheads through Amazon as I could not find them locally and my Mom constantly used them.  She said they kept her dry mouth at bay.<br />Very fast service and Mom was tickled with them
1;Uncle Lee's Tea can be difficult to find where I live.  I keep some of this tea a work.  It helps brighten the day and keep me motivated.  If you enjoying warming tea do this one.  This is also the tea I travel with.  It has helped me with motion sickness.
1;I drink this tea all winter long.  It is my favorite of all hot teas.  It is best chai tea I've found.  I drink mine without any sugar or milk in it so it's zero calories.  I've also heard people say how good it is with milk and a little sugar.  I can't find this anywhere in Colorado Springs so I always order it online.
1;Talk about the added triple Tomato kick this is the product!!!<br />I love this stuff Best powder I've tried hands down. Can be added to any<br />recipe that calls for tomato or soups or even season. Since I'm a RAW Vegan<br />I use this a lot 
1;This is very good tomato powder.  I have used it every day to supplement my vegetable intake.  I sprinkle it on my food.  I have made sauce with it.  I still have plenty and I use it every day.  I plan to buy more.  I'm very happy with it.  I  recommend it.
1;"""I saw this on the Dr. Oz show and ordered it.  I have diabetes and have been looking for a natural sweetener that doesn't send my blood glucose through the roof and that tastes good.  I think this is it!  I have tried this for baking"
1;TThis product is the best. I have two friendship will be ordering the coconut palm sugar. I do not buy regular sugar anymore. Amazon is the new shopping tool for me. My products are received before the company stated day of arrival Thanks.
1;Looking for a way to drink more un-sugared liquids so I went with a bulk tea that folks say is a very healthy one (Hibiscus). I make it real strong and add a lot of fresh lime.  It has been a lifesaver with temperatures here in Austin Texas in the 105-112 range these last couple of months.
1;This is really a wonder tea. Every tea lover should try this whole bud tea in their life time  and see the results. I saw lot of imrovmenet in the glow of skin. No caffine make sme to drink at least 3 times a tea. I can feel the imrovmenet in my energy levels.
1;"""I just wanted to say I was very pleasantly surprised to receive this tea in such a huge bag!  The tea is so yummy.  I just pour boiling water over a few petals from the kettle and let steep 5 mins.  Sometimes I add a spoon of sugar but most of the time just drink it without.  When the tea is ready to drink"
1;I have ordered this yesterday and it arrived today. It was delivered in a nice bag sealed so you can continue using it as a container. the flowers smell fresh and look perfect they are not crushed rather in good shape. They taste perfect .. looking forward for future orders
1;"""I bought this to make my own version of Starbucks' passion tea at home. It's really yummy!<br /><br />You get A LOT of hibiscus flowers. The tea itself it tangy and fragrant. I make according to the directions but double or triple the flowers to make a concentrate to pour over ice. I add the Starbucks melon syrup to it. If you can't find the Starbucks syrup"
1;I have never tried Hibiscus tea before. The flavor is very nice. I like to mix with lemonade for an Arnold Palmer cold but also very good as a hot tea. You can combime with other tea for a nice flavored green or black tea. This bag makes alot of tea!
1;I never drank Hibiscus tea before. i drink it daily now. i am very happy with this product and expect to order more. its a big bag and it lasts some time. i regard the value to be very good. I hope this helps
1;Wonderful product to use daily! I just put a small handful in some hot water and have a great cup of tea.  A favorite way to use it is to let it cool slightly and pour it over ice to enjoy a cup of iced hibiscus tea. I'm taking the holistic approach to control blood pressure and I do feel drinking this daily helps.
1;"""A friend of mine had tried hibiscus tea and said it was a great  fruity  tea. I bought the Davidson's and was pleased with the product. It is a loose tea and can be steeped for 3-5 minutes. I used roughly a teaspoon per 8oz serving. I sweeten it with agave syrup or honey. It's great served over ice too!"""
1;"""I adore hibiscus tea.  Reminds me somewhat of pomegranate juice. Use with caution--can significantly lower your blood pressure.  I like the packaging that it came in.  The bag is lined on the inside to retain freshness and has an attached tie closure (very convenient).<br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SATIZA >Davidson's Tea Bulk"
1;I use about 5 rounded tbs per one gallon. We use quite a bit of the tea. If you make it in bulk it can be drunk cold or reheated. I boil a gallon of water place the 5 tbs in the pot and turn off the burner. It will continue to boil for a few minutes. I have let it set as long as over night. Remember that this is not black tea - it will not get bitter if you steep it too long. The nice thing about the hibiscus tea is that it really doesn't need refrigeration. Just make sure that you boil it for a couple of minutes to sterilize the brew. By the way I am very cautious about the fantastic claims of many herbal poducts. I can say with some certainty that hibiscus tea does indeed lower blood pressure.
1;Bought the tea because I heard it lowered your blood pressure by several points.  Went to the Dr. and it is true.  I love the taste of the tea and make it in my ice maker.  This way i have a pitcher of it always in the ref.  I also love the bright red color.  I will keep on drinking this product.
1;"""I researched this in 2011 and found that it helps lower blood pressure. Two months ago I bought hibiscus tea at a local discount store that sold the tea bags for $1.99 plus tax for 20 teabags. This tea is absolutely delicious. It tastes like sweet & sour fruit somewhat like tart cherries. I've been drinking at least 1 cup a day for the last 2 months and my blood pressure is down an average of 8-10 points. Needing more"
1;"""I was raised on the Caribbean drink  Sorrel  and there are limited options locally to find a good quality hibiscus flower.  I've resorted to the Internet and have purchased Ocho Rios and Flor de Jamaica but the price and shipping charges deterred me from regularly purchasing these products. This is by far my favorite in regards to quality and consistency and for a better price with Amazon Subscribe and Save.  The Davidson product's flowers are finer than those other products so you need to be careful with portioning if you are use to making sorrel with bigger flowers.  A little goes a long way with this product"
1;"""Let me start out by saying this bulk tea bag comes with a lot of Hibiscus flowers.  A little bit of hibiscus goes a long way.  I've even reused the the flowers after I am done with my drink.  I recomend this product for anyone who likes hibiscus or sour drinks in general (of course it can be sweetened up too"
1;"""I was 100% satisfied with my purchase of Davidson's Pure Org Hibiscus Flowers from Amazon. I had read that drinking hibiscus tea can help lower your blood pressure. This has worked well for me. The tea is good tasting and a very pretty red color. The quality of the dried hibiscus flowers was excellent.I will continue ordering this product. As has been my experience with Amazon"
1;This tea is fantastic!  It has a taste that reminds one of cranberries.  The picture is misleading.  The bag is about 4 times the size of a bag of coffee and has a Ziploc-type resealable closure on the top. It's totally worth the money and I highly recommend it!
1;"""I purchased for my mom and she love it.  She places a few leaves in water and makes her tea.  It taste great and her blood pressure is under control.  She takes her medicine on a as need bases.  She is exercising"
1;I have purchased this tea several times before. It is still very good. I drink it by itself or sometimes mix it with other teas. I like to eat the hibiscus leaves after drinking the tea. I will continue buying this one.
1;"""I have purchased this tea repeatedly this year.  My boss and I both drink it in the office just like coffee.  It is miraculous at dropping blood pressure. My boss is now off half his medication.  We love the taste and it is also really good cold with ice.  I haven't tried it with vodka yet"
1;This tea has an full bodied fruity taste.  I brew it strong for iced tea and sweeten it with Splenda.  It is similar in appearance and taste to a red wine.  Since I have a nasal allergy to alcohol I have stumbled upon an acceptable substitute.
1;The hibiscus tea is exactly as described and Amazon shipped the item very quickly. This newer packaging appears to be mylar or aluminum lined. This helps to keep the tea fresh between brewings.<br /><br />I bought it for its positive health benefits. Since drinking 3 to 4 cups a day my diastolic bp has decreased about 10 points and my cystolic bp has dropped about 8 points. To be completely transparent I am also drinking the same amount of Davison's Bulk Rooibos Tea per day.<br /><br />Both teas taste great. The hibiscus smells like fragrant flowers and tastes just a bit sour but that's fine.  The rooibos has a different frangrance and tastes smoother and more delicate compared to the hibiscus.<br /><br />I just ordered more rooibos tea and will order more hibiscus when the bag gets low.
1;Would  buy this again and again were I to run out<br />1 lb is a lot of Hibiscus but this is great quality<br />Perfect for making herbal tea blends<br />Works great for adding some zest to cocktails as well<br />Hibiscus infusions go well in so many things
1;"""I make a 3qt pitcher of this tea for my family just about every day.  I use 15g of flowers (1/2 oz or a scant 1/2 cup) per quart of tea.  So just about 1.5 cups of flower petals in my Mr. Coffee tea maker.  I add 210g (10 servings) of <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P74NXM >Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Raw Blue Agave"
1;Great product.<br />Delicious sour tea - potent and wonderful quality dried Hibiscus flower.<br />~8 petals in a hot mug of water and some honey makes a great tea that's good for you - It lowers your blood pressure!<br /><br />I would do business with this vendor again.
1;"""I bought this bulk tea to help with blood pressure issues and to have something I could just throw in a pitcher and not have to heat or  fix  sort of like Sun tea without the sun. Between this and my wonderful <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J3JFJU >Finum Brewing Large Basket"
1;Im not much of a Starbucks fan and most of their coffee turms my stomach in knots but not so with Sumatra!This is a low acid coffee of high quality and at a very competitive price. Coffee used to give me all sorts of gastric/reflux problems but coffees such as this...and $$$peaberry$$$ allow me to drink coffee again!
1;Great service.  I will order again.  Sumatra is not for the faint of heart.  It is full bodied and wakes you up with a bang.  Just what we need to get going in this modern age when you must jump out of bed and hit the floor running....
1;"""This is my fave Starbuck's coffee.  So I used a $25 gift certificate.  In these troubled times buying food instead of CD's or other crap seemed like a good adult idea. Of course I still go to the actual store to meet friends and get so buzzed on caffeine I can't concentrate.  But hey"
1;"""I've been a daily drinker of Starbucks French Roast for quite some time. I want a bold coffee with great flavor and that delivered. So does Sumatra which is now my favorite in the X-Bold line. The beans have a very unique smell to them and the coffee starts off with bold flavor and finishes with a nice herbal"
1;"""If you like Starbucks Sumatra blend coffee Amazon is the place to buy it.  The purchase of only one 12-ounce bag is close to the store price but the three-pack order which comes out to about $8/bag is definitely a good price"
1;"""My wife just loves these little things as this is what she carries everywhere. A purse is perfect for tucking this dispenser away and purchasing them in quantity means you won't have to rely on a Super Market (as I do) which does not carry this product any longer. In fact"
1;I ordered this product online because it's small and can easily fit into my backpack.  I use it as a substitute when I go out and there's no artificial sweetner substitute either in restaurants or when I go to friends' places.<br /><br />This product is very handy to have in those times as I have diabetes and I have to be careful about my blood sugar.<br /><br />Definitely recommend it highly.
1;I find the tabs so convenient to take with me in my purse and also use them at home.  Best part is each tab is the equivalent of one teaspoon of sugar which is all I want.  The packets are the equivalent of two teaspoons - I don't want the waste or mess of using one half of a packet.  Wish they were easier to find locally since the shipping was not free.
1;"""This is a great-low fat snack that I eat between lunch and dinner almost every day. It has a good flavor and fills me up after just a few pieces. Buying them in bulk like this has saved me a lot of money versus buying them one or two at a time from the grocery store"
1;"""I have decided to write this review after reading about how disappointed some people are with this product. This is not a traditional South American mate (which is smoked). This tea is an unsmoked pure mate"
1;Ok.. based on the 2 previous reviews and their descriptions.. I bought this product. I cannot tell how much this product rocks. I love it. If you like a fairly bold coffee in the european style (I lived in Germany for 3.5 years) then I would highly recommend this. I've tried all the Starbucks (African Kitamu is my fav from that line but I always stopped it a bit short during brewing to keep it a bit stronger) and this is way better. This is now going to be part of my tassimo collection and probably my daily coffee.
1;I tried Tassimo made coffee for the first time at a friends house. It just so happened to be the Kenya blend. When the coffee finished brewing I thought there was something wrong with the machine since such a small amount was produced with foamy stuff laying on the top. My friend said that was the way it suppose to be so I added some organic cream and organic sugar and WOW!!! The best coffee I have ever tasted. I drank it up like candy. If it wasn't 10:30pm I would have had a second cup. Now I am on a mission to buy my own Tassimo just so I can brew my own Kenya T-cups....
1;"""We've bought probably every single  upper end  (that sounds so bad but I just mean we don't like Maxwell House etc. and I don't know how else to say it.) coffee for the Tassimo just to try new things all the time. We recently got these and it quickly became one of our absolute favorites. It has a VERY smooth taste"
1;I purchased because I like bran muffins and have been unable to buy them locally since they're available only some of the time. Easy recipe on the bag with few additional ingredients needed. I prefer to add some apple sauce to provide additional moisture and a few raisins for texture and flavor. Further (independent) research on the product reveals that this product is very healthy in that it contains whole grains and unbleached flower. I prefer to sweeten with Agave Nectar which is also billed as a healthy choice. I like it because it tastes good...
1;"""My Weimaraner is has a very sensitive stomach and terrible skin allergies.  I have tried so many  grain-free  and  for sensitive stomachs  types of food.  This is the only dog food that doesn't aggravate my dog's stomach or skin."""
1;i love spicy and this BBQ sauce is definitely spicy. I cant believe its zero yup zero calories. Its mind blowing. We all pour on the sauces and the calories add up quickly but not with Walden farms. I love them.
1;"""I purchased this product after reading the book  Water and Salt  by Dr. Barbara Hendel. I would highly recommend both the book and the Himalayan crystal salt. I make the salt sole solution by disolving the crystals in Figi water and take a teaspoon of the sole in a glass of the Figi artesian well water each morning when I first get out of bed. It wakes me up and makes my body feel alive! Knowledge is power. Read the book. It is very informative as to the benefits of Himalayan salt verses the adverse effects of regular table salt. It is an eye opener!"""
1;We have a lot of different flavors at my office and I was lucky to try them all before purchasing some for home. I have to say that this is my favorite one by far. I was used to drinking spanish coffee and this definitely a great replacement since I now use the K-cups.
1;"""My husband always buys starbucks coffee when he doesn't use the Kuerig coffee brewer. We have tried many k cups and this is his favorite. It is a bold rich coffee. So if you like a strong cup of coffee that tastes as good as starbucks"
1;The bold flavor of the Italian Roast by Tully's is presently my favorite coffee for every day consumption. It is rich with no bitterness or aftertaste. I highly recommend it if you are one who loves a bold cup of coffee.
1;"""After years of drink the same old Folgers drip coffee a group of us decided to purchase a Keurig unit for our office.  When any one of us purchase a pack of K-Cups we often share with other so that we can find our favorite"
1;I ordered this coffee when Amazon had it on their Friday special because it was one of the few advertized as 'bold'.  I like a strong cup of coffee that's not bitter.<br />This one hits it.  The taste is really nice with no bad after taste.<br />I've had my Keurig for about 2 years now and this coffee and Obsidian are my two favorites so far.  Tully's Italian Roast gets the top spot because it is less expensive.<br />I will keep it on my list to not run out of.
1;This is an excellent bold roast. Perfect for a morning wake-up. I've tried many other K-cups and Tully's is my favorite. Amazon has the best pricing I've found and they ship fast. I will order this again!
1;"""Without question the best coffee available for a Keurig brewer! Consistently delicious! This box of 50 only lasts about one month in our home and this is not the only K-Cup flavor we purchase! <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M62D5S >Tully's Italian Roast"
1;We have tried MANY of the different flavors of coffee but the ITALIAN ROAST is my Husband's favorite.  May cost a bit more then others but WELL WORTH THE Price.  Give it a try if you like a stronger but NOT oily coffee
1;This is a great coffee.  This is not in its original packaging.  I will assume this is shipped from bulk as the k-cups are thrown into a shipping box.  The order is for 50 pieces.  I counted the k-cups (only due to the way they were packaged) and the order is short 3 pieces.  The contents were only 47 pieces.  I contacted the seller but got no response.  I will update as this evolves.
1;I like a more robust flavored coffee and try a few different ones. This Tullys Italian Roast consistently delivers. The breakfast blend and French Roast is also a good choice. If it is too strong you an always choose a larger cup size on your brewer. The taste is comparable to what I would purchase out shopping for a nice pick me up.
1;Tully's Italian Roast K-cups is the best coffee I have ever had. Each k-cup is vacuum sealed to give it it's optimal freshness. It's bold flavor makes a perfect cup of coffee every time. It was received within a few days after ordering from Amazon. Fifty individual k-cups are packaged in a cardboard box. Thanks Amazon for the  convenience and I now am able to kick back and just enjoy a great product.
1;"""I love buying these in bulk because it's much cheaper in the long run. I got tired of buying the smaller boxes for $10 when I could buy 50 for $29. And having it delivered was even better!<br /><br />Taste wise - this coffee is bold"
1;Purchased this after receiving a Tully's sampler in the mail. This brand hadn't been on my radar at all until then since we usually alternated Black Tiger or Jet Fuel. This is a new favorite and we will definitely purchase again!
1;This is one of our favorite blends. The k-cups themselves seem to be well-made (no exploders--least so far). Italian is between medium and strong. It's a fairly stout blend without being too smoky (some french roasts go too far into the smoke spectrum for my tastes). This is one of our go-to cups.
1;"""I bought a Keurig brewer last Christmas and have been sampling all the different varieties. I enjoy being able to have a variety of good fresh coffee on hand. I like the darker roasts like French and the 'Jet Fuel' brand which is a good roast. This Italian Roast is my absolute favorite"
1;Great choice for a K-Cup Coffee!  Great flavor is in these Kups! I've tried sampler packs and this one stands out as a great Kup any time of day!  I praised my Cuisinart for years with fresh ground beans but TIR is so easy in the Kurig and the taste is superior!
1;"""The arrival of a K-cup coffee maker in our home has been somewhat controversial because we didn't brew a truly great cup of coffee for several weeks after we got it. We kept working through samples of different flavors"
1;"""No bitterness here...this is a hearty but mellow choice in the Tully's lineup.  We especially like the 50 pack convenience.  Jet Fuel is also great.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006HPGVPK >Delightful Short Stories Little Romances</a>"""
1;"""This is by far the best Keurig coffee I've had! I'm not a coffee connoisseur but I do enjoy a nice bold coffee (9yrs living in Europe will do that). This is the first Keurig coffee to actually give me flashbacks to my time in Europe...bravo Tully's"
1;I like Keurig coffee & especially like the italian roast. The Tully italian roast has a pleasant aroma & no after taste. I like the quantity of 50. I am a real coffee drinker & so this way I don't have to be purchasing real often.
1;This is my absolute favorite coffee. When I see a sale like this I always order a box. I am very particular about the coffee I buy and this has never disappointed me. My only complaint is it seems to take a bit longer to arrive than other companies I have ordered from.
1;"""I buy this and a Kona blend for my brewer. I have tried many other brands and flavors but I always come back to this one. I  drown  my coffee with flavored coffeemates but still get a coffee taste from this one."""
1;This is my favorite K-Cup!  I keep trying others but I always come back to this one. I'm not a coffee snob and I really don't know much about coffee but I know this tastes great! It smells amazing and isn't bitter.  This is a little harder to find in stores but amazon's prices beat the stores anyway.
1;I like this brand and the size of the cans. Leftover tuna is not good.  I disagree with the previous comments.  I do not think it is too fishy.  I would not compare it to cat food.  I have tried other brands and dislike the over the top smell and the mushy textures.  I like Chicken of the Sea and buy it frequently.
1;"""I love eating and using food seasoning that are good for your body. In the grocery stores many products say natural but are not but this palm sugar is natural and organic and sweetens without the secret  bad health side effects  of the refined table sugar. (secret because the fluff over attitude... yeah sugar is bad for me doesn't sink in as it should because table sugar is very harmful... in such that cancer loves sugar!)<br />Healthy eating to you !"""
1;I bought Mishima Hot sour soup mix from Walmart. It set in the cabinet for a while until I finally tried the mix.<br />wow wow wow... this stuff is goooooooooooood<br />I highly recommend this soup mix.<br />Very good.<br />I put some rice noodles with it.. DELICIOUS!!<br />GET SOME..YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!<br />JAZZY JOEY G.
1;I love this peanut butter.  I am someone who has to eat peanut butter everyday.  Eating regular peanut butter in this manner will make me fatter than I want to be so this is a great substitute.  It has the taste of reese's peanut butter cups.  If you want it sweeter add a natural sugar substitute.  If you want a peanut butter drink just make it extra watery or mix it with milk.  I could live on this stuff.  I only wish it came in a better container as the bag makes it hard to not get it everywhere.  I will be dumping it into a glass jar soon as I ordered 4 bags.  It makes it easier to scoop from a hard container.  I have tried the non chocolate version of this but will only eat it when I run out of the chocolate as I have a major sweet tooth.
1;I LOVE this product.  I love the taste of peanut butter and chocolate.  Our local coffee shop has a peanut butter cup mocha.  You can imagine the calories in it.  I put a serving of this (2 tbsp) and a hot chocolate packet in coffee and i have a peanut butter cup mocha without all the calories of the local coffee shop.  It is delicious.
1;I have been buying this for at least two years now.  It makes great peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that are figure friendly.  My daughter has used it in smoothies and likes it too.  I must say though the price on Amazon is higher than buying it directly from Bell Plantation.  I will probably purchase it next time from them.
1;I give this to my three cats every now and then as a treat and they love it. My husband bought the Whiskas brand in the purple box and the cats all snub their noses to it. hah boy they are finicky!<br /><br /> ^..^
1;my cat has always loved milk but I knew it wasn't good for his tummy. So I found this and he loved it! It looks like baby formula but that apparently kitty can't tell the difference. Nice treat for our otherwise finicky cat.
1;"""Not all cats are lactose intolerant and my kitties have gotten real cream now and again as a treat.  I thought I would give this stuff a try just out of curiosity.  I was not prepared for the reaction.  Both my cats turn into meowing"
1;My cat loved milk and always nagged me for some. Unfortunately it gave her the runs. I was so happy I saw this at Petsmart. She loves it and her tummy tolerates it well. She gets about a tablespoon every night before bed and I would hate to forget to give it to her. Would get no sleep that night for sure.
1;"""I've been giving them to my little Affenpinscher since he was a puppy (5 lbs -- he's 7 lbs. now) and they are his favorite of all the dog treats I've tried. I found they were a great chewy treat when he was teething"
1;"""I first came across the seasoning mixture known as Scichimi Togarashi where it was used as a condiment at a Japanese fast food chain in Southern California.<br /><br />It manages through a wonderful synergy of ingredients to be a flavor enhancing medium of addictive power.  I use it primarily on Asian foods"
1;I'm extremely impressed that with the strength of this shot my heart never did extreme palpitatations. I bought two different energy shots years ago that did that and it made me nervous taking them.  I had my fingers crossed and gave this one a try at Duane reade one day.  It works like a charm without the downsides and crashing.  So I immediately bought a box here at amazon for a better deal! Another plus --it doesn't taste bad at all! None of that cough tasting medicinal taste. Will stick to this one.
1;I'd recommend this to anyone that has tried the rest of the energy shots out there and are unhappy with the results. This is the one and only that works for me and keeps me going all night without the jitters or crash!!!
1;"""I found these at my local Trader Joe's grocery store and I've been a fan ever since.  Pirate's Booty makes a healthy and satisfying alternative to run-of-the-mill deep fried potato or corn chips.  As a snack"
1;"""What a great name for a snack. My kids (5 and 7) love these. I find them pretty tasty too.<br /><br />These are bascially cheese puffs although softer and  smoother  than your standard mass market puff (like cheetos).<br /><br />These are a regular in our snack cabinet (the other being pirates cannon balls :->)"""
1;"""I was both horrified and delighted when this huge 2 x 1.5 x 1 feet box from Amazon came to the office for me. No wonder ordering it with Amazon Prime 2-day shipping still took 3 days (plus the weekend...)<br /><br />So be warned"
1;I absolutely love these. They are so yummy and nutritious too. They have all the tastiness of cheese popcorn without the annoying kernels and they are much healthier. My family (especially the kids) love these!
1;"""I first encountered this product at COSTCO.  When they discontinued it I decided to find another source.  I have diverticulosis and the doctor says I should avoid popcorn completely.  This is a wonderful substitute.  I also am diabetic and the product has no sugar and not too much carbohydrate either.  I thought 12 bags would last about 6 months.  I didn't count on my wife and son acquiring a taste for it as well.  Twelve bags is only about a three month supply.  While other flavors are available"
1;My daughter who likes very few foods told me one of her friends gave her this and it was GOOD.So I went to the store and WOW she was RIGHT. But buying this online was the best. The price was less than the store and I now by it by the case.Everyone who eats this Pirates Booty buys it again and again.
1;"""There should be some sort of Surgeon General's warning on these they are so good. With all the high fat and high sugar cheeze puffs most people are used to these may taste somewhat bland at first bite"
1;Without a doubt this is the best snack I have ever had.  Beware: I can eat a large bag at one sitting and usually do.  I am on the auto ship for one box a month.  I  usually place an extra order.  Watch out these can be addictive.  Do not like the vegie ones.
1;This stuff is great.  Healthy for children.  Great taste.  If you buy a dozen it is only $2 per bag.  One warning - when I had 12 on hand we tended to eat way more than normal!  Highly recommend.  Love Vegiie Booty as well.
1;"""I received this package yesterday in a very sturdy box and last night I decided to try them and they are sooooooooooooo delicious.  The cheese doesn't get on your fingers or hand like the orange balls and they are fresh. The only problem is that you can't stop eating them.  They just melt in your mouth and they are crunchie.  You can be sure that when I am almost done with them"
1;...seems like that statement could be embarrassingly taken out of context :).<br /><br />This a great snack that is tasty and not high in fat like many other similar snacks.  Amazon's subscribe and save seems like a great way to get it for a really great price too.  I'm hooked! :)
1;"""I love Pirate's Booty!  Soft and yummy with just enough cheddar flavor and doesn't make my fingers orange! It's healthier than eating that stuff on the chip aisle at the grocery store. Everyone at work that has tried it wants to buy some"
1;Pirates Booty tastes very good. It is kind of healthy for you because they make the booty out of rice. They pop the rice so thier puffy and crunchy and then add white chedder. Pirates booty is a good snack to eat and comes in different sized packages. It's awesome!!!
1;I read the reviews and decided to try this.  We got it and tried it and it is alreday almost gone.  The kids and I love it.  It is soooo good and it is good for you too.  We can't wait to order more pirate stuff.
1;"""We have purchased boxes and boxes of Pirate's Booty over the last year.  We used to buy individual bags at Whole Foods but they are expensive and get eaten too quickly.  My 1 year old son just loves them and they are great for his self feeding skills.  My 8 year old loves them as afterschool snacks.  My husband and I enjoy them - but we try not to eat too much since these are snacks afterall and we should not have too much junk food.<br /><br />A few months ago"
1;I have purchased coffee on line as I think I can get good quality and avoid the high prices of Starbucks etc... I make my own coffee now. I believe I can save over $900.00 a year by making my own coffee and not buying coffee by the cup. In these tough economic times $900.00 is a lot of money.
1;"""I nursed our daughter for over 4 long months. She was very colicky and had reflux. We kept getting nowhere with our family practice physician so switched to a pediatrician at 6 months old. After I quit nursing her"
1;"""This is perfectly acceptable commercial dry coil vermicelli.  Macaroni  products refer to any pasta made from wheat without eggs. Vermicelli simply refers to the shape of the  macaroni . Vermicelli is simply a slightly thicker spaghetti"
1;This is a great gift if you have a soldier overseas!  The guys use it to keep their mouth moist during the blistering hot summers and it doesn't fall apart and lose flavor after a few hours like some of the other gums out there.  Plus with this pack they get a variety and it'll last them for a while.
1;"""I really like the idea of variety packs like this as you can sample all the flavors without buying a case and also it's a great idea so you don't get tired of the same flavor. Inside the box are 3 wintermints"
1;I first came into contact with this gum from a Bzzz Campaign for which I am a Bzzz Agent.  This gum really surprised me.  What are the qualities that you want in a gum?<br /><br />1. Great flavor<br />2. Retains its softness<br />3. Does not promote dental caries<br />4. Long lasting flavor<br />5. Not to sticky on bubble popping<br />6. Good elasticity rebound on bitedown<br /><br />This gum holds all these qualities.  I think it is well worth your trying this product if those 6 points matter to you.  You accomplish all those 6 in one gum.  Not a common thing.
1;"""I LOVE THESE! If you are someone who likes dried fruit but not all the crusty sugar thats on it you will love these. If you are someone who wants to eat dried fruit as a healthy snack instead of candied dried fruit"
1;i tried dried black mission figs 1st and then dried mangos .It s just love at the 1st bite so i wanted to order more and ll order it again in future  but cannot find it on amazon.com now so i have to wait for it. one of my favorite dried fruit on amazon.com
1;"""I bought these Petrodex chews for my dogs because I like Petrodex toothpaste <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00025K0R6 >Petrodex 51106 Enzymatic Toothpaste for Dogs- Poultry Flavor- Economy Size</a>.  The dogs love the chews"
1;"""I first switched to this food for my senior cats who both had cancer (most likely from my feeding them cheap food all their lives - never again). Within days of starting my cancer-cats on this food they both perked up"
1;"""This cat food saved my one cat's life - she was getting very fat and this food helped her lose some weight in a short amount of time.  It's great - and all 5 of my cats love it!  Amazon is the best - fast delivery"
1;"""I strongly believe in paying more for higher quality food now to avoid paying high health costs later. Natural Balance is a little pricey BUT it is high quality food and my cats love it. I have noticed a positive change in my cats' health"
1;I can only get this cat food at PETCO and the closest one is over an hour away. I was so relived to find it here on amazon and at a great price. Thank you amazon!<br />We chose this food because they don't dangerously test on animals like some companies (IAMS) do. Also this food does not contain any bi-products. It does contain some rice fillers but it is so hard to avoid with the budget we are on. This is the best we can afford. Our cats are very happy and healthy!
1;"""Pantoufle is six months old and has had this cat food from age 10 weeks.It really enjoys it . Since it is a growing boy its food is always available.I wonder if short hair cats get fur balls problems  it has never been sick "
1;"""I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However"
1;i really have to say I love this chamomile tea. Especially when I have a cough and/or cold I brew some and pour it in a bowl to inhale the chamomile vapors. It works just great. Of course I also love to drink it when I'm sick. I like the chamomile taste and that there are not other ingredients in it but the chamomile.
1;"""I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions"
1;I have used this tea for 2 of my 3 pregnancies. It's a little hard to 1st get used to the taste but now I love it. It helps strengthen the uterus. I started drinking it in my 3rd trimester and drank it for a few weeks postpartum as well.
1;I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep.  I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.
1;I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose.<br /><br />Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.
1;"""I had very painful cramps with Very Heavy bleeding that lasted for 5 days! and this cycle repeated every 21 days! So I would have a full period twice a month!! I was miserable and had to schedule my life around my cycle"
1;"""I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy.  The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes.  My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical.  Obviously"
1;"""I use it to help jump start my weight loss regime. I sometimes flip flop up and down 8 pounds when I am not careful and i drink this tea for about 3 days and I shed it all. It is NOT a gentle cleanser though it will have your stomach turning and yearning but in 8-12 hours it does the cleansing job and it usually only does it for the first go round.<br />I would say go for it"
1;We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2-3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed. From day one this worked great. Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying. She still didn't start sleeping through the night but it definitely helped as she started sleeping at least one 6 hour block at night which is a godsend when you are only getting 3-4 hours total per night.
1;"""I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.  Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better.  I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also"
1;"""This tea is great.  I cook it in gallon batches and sweeten it with agave nectar and keep it in the fridge.  I guess it  worked  because my daughter was born after just 4 hours of labor and 20 minutes of pushing.  I'm still drinking it since I had just ordered another 3-pack of boxes of it the day before our baby was born.  My husband loves the tea too and he doesn't even have a uterus."""
1;"""I trust Alvita's brand because all of the teas I have tried from them are pure and excellent quality. The Raspberry leaf is no exception. The taste is mild and it works like a charm to ease menstrual cramps. A must have during your moon cycle. Good value for the price.<br /><br />Also check out <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3QLQ >Yogi Woman's Moon Cycle"
1;"""I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey"
1;This tea was very good. I was Very happy I got it. A tea that is so good for you and will help many things in your body. My breathing felt better after the first cup. I will be buying more again soon. Doug in Calif...
1;I used a higher priced senna for several years and out of the need to economize I tried alvita. Works just as well and is not individually wrapped as the others are and for me it's just one less thing I have to do considering I fix this every evening for me and hubby... I have medical problems so anything that saves me extra step I'm happy for it...
1;"""Product arrived quickly with no problems.  Everything was intact and the kids were happy with the outcome.  The item produced fairly accurate looking sushi.  Did not eat the candies since there is too much handling and who knows what is in it?  However"
1;This product is so much fun.  I made this set and the bento one with my sister.  We know a little japanese and were able to read the directions and cleared up anything we didn't get with videos online.  Even if you don't know Japanese it is easy to understand through pictures and if you use videos online.  It tastes like artificial candy and but wasn't bad.  The fish eggs by itself were pretty good and I found the rice good but with a weird texture.  However its fun and I'm glad I bought it.
1;"""These things are full of sugar with no  benefit  other than the fact that they taste good. I seem to have chronic dry mouth and sometimes it's nice to not chew gum or have a mint in my mouth. These are a nice alternative and now my hubby likes them too. They aren't overly sweet like a lifesaver"
1;"""Most other salad dressings that say they are  light  actually have a lot of calories in my opinion.  This Ranch Dressing from Walden Farms tastes very good and is calorie free.  It just doesn't get any better than that!"""
1;I have never been able to drink instant milk until I found this full cream milk.  I buy organic milk and this tastes so close to the organic it is hard to tell them apart.  I have ordered this product numerous times as it is so good.  I have it in my food storage program also.
1;Love this popcorn and eat it often.  I wouldn't say its totally hulless....but 90% less get stuck in my teeth.<br /><br />Also had the same issue as other reviewer...bag split open inside the cardboard box.  Popcorn was spilling out of the box as the UPS man brought it in.  Amazon refunded me for it.  If someone at Whirley-Pop is reading this....thicker bags please!<br /><br />I do plan to purchase more when this runs out.

1;My dog is sick and on prednisone.  The vet recommended this food because of weight gain from the prednisone.  My Yorkie Loved it! I was really surprised.  He eats every bite.  It's really tiny pieces so its easy for a tiny dog to eat.  I mixed a bit of his old food with it at first and gradually lower the amount of his older food.  Now he is just eating this food. That way there's no stomach upset from drastically changing his diet. I would definitely recommend this food for weight loss and it was neurology vet approved.
1;I received a package of chocolate which were melted and the ice packets hot. I filled out return form and within a couple of days I not only was notified through Amazon that I would be getting a full refund but I also received a personal email from the company apologizing for the situation. Maybe I will order the chocolate in winter when it's not 100 degrees in Tucson. I was so thrilled and felt like they exemplified the best customer service. I will definitely let my friends know and I will look to buy from them in the future.
1;I bought one of these and also one of their banks that comes on a stand and they were both nice. I liked the idea that you can put either gum or candy in it and adjust how much comes out. We have had it almost 4 months now and it works perfect.Large Gumball Bank with Stand<br /><br />Definitely going to buy a couple more for Christmas gifts.
1;"""I ordered this as a surprise for my husband who loves bubble gum.  He was like a kid again when he opened the package.  He displays it proudly on his workbench and every coin we have ends up in it.  Ladies"
1;this is one of the sauces i use with the refried beans. it is awesome. i started using this sauce about 30 years ago. in fact they changed the way they made it not long after i started using it. this is an essential food item to always have!
1;I have been using this product -- Amore Sun-dried Tomato Paste instead of regular tomato paste in all of my Italian and other recipes.  It makes a great lasanga and more.  Rub it on chicken before you roast it in the oven.
1;This product is incredible and very different from the normal canned 'bitter' tomato paste. It is expensive but well worth it for certain uses. I use it exclusively in place of pizza sauce for the pizzas I make at home. It is wonderful. Should be on your 'bucket list.
1;"""My older recently adopted greyhound was diagonosed with stage-4 peridontal disease and had several teeth removed.  As part of her dental care I purchased C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews.  They help with the tarter control"
1;"""My nine year old yellow lab had bad breath and needed her teeth cleaned. My vet suggested using an enzyme product. I did a search and found this one. It's a two-fer... she loves the chew and in just one week her breath is great and her teeth are SO CLEAN. I am really impressed with this product. I wish it were a little less expensive"
1;My three dogs love these.  I highly suggest buying the bag of large chews and cutting them in half with pruning sheers.  I give the (halved) large chews to my medium and small dogs.  It's great for their teeth and it keeps them busy for a while.
1;I have a pit mix and a 15 month old lab and both are powerful chewers. They love these and cannot wait for me to put my coat on in the morning because they know they will get their treat. I tried the XL chews but did not see much difference so went back for LG--more for the money.
1;My dogs go crazy for these chews!  They are their absolute favorite treat.  I like that the sizes vary so I can give the smaller size to my older dog and the rest to the other two.  The best part is that these chews help keep their teeth clean.  I also use the CET toothpaste.  These chews seem to digest just fine so no worries about that.  I recommend these highly.
1;"""Vet recommended C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for my dog years ago. She loves them! They do a great job on keeping her teeth nice and white. I always order these from Amazon and when the box arrives"
1;"""My dogs (English Springer Spaniels) get a chew every morning after their breakfast. But I always make sure that it is a specific kind of chew and CET Chews meet that requirement.  The dogs like the taste and eagerly attack this chew while cleaning their teeth in the same mode.<br />The chews I purchased are a nice size for medium to large dogs and if you are looking for a good dental chew"
1;My vet approves these for my lab with a weight problem. They really help keep her  teeth white and her breathe clean while adding no calories. I buy them at Amazon because the price is lower and the service is quick.
1;Our vet recommended these to help control tarted buildup.  Our dog absolutly loves them - I almost think they are addicting!  She only gets one a day and she makes sure we do not forget to give it to her.  They have seemed to help much more than just rawhide chews at keeping her teeth clean.
1;These chews were recommended by my vet and I found they removed remarkably well what looked like stains. They aren't perfect but my dog is 12. I got twice the quantity on Amazon for the same price as I paid at the vet's. I do not like raw hides but these seem to have been well digested
1;Who would have thought that my dogs would enjoy something that helps take care of them? The CETs work reasonably well at removing plaque from their teeth - though if you are expecting heavy buildup to disappear you will be disappointed.  Good way to maintain good oral hygiene between cleanings though.<br /><br />If only I could get them to chew them longer...
1;My vet recommended these chewies because i'm so awful about brushing my dogs teeth.  These treats are amazing.  I have been giving my two Bearded Collies these once a day for the past 4 months and their teeth look great and their breath is so much better.  They just love them and it usually takes about 20 minutes to a half hour for the dogs to chew them all up.  I will continue to buy these and the Amazon price is fantastic.
1;I have been spending at least $150.00/dog/yr for dental cleaning....after only 4-5 months their teeth were starting to look dirty again...my Vet recommended these....I have always been suspect of rawhides but these have enzymes in them...gave them one a day for two weeks and then twice a week after that....don't think they will have to have their teeth done for a while....they look great....when the teeth look slightly dirty...give them one a day for 3-4 days....they look better again....also...got these at half price...even better....
1;"""This is a really great price for these chew sticks. My dog absolutely loves them... He sits in front of the cabinet we keep them in every night after we settle in and waits for us to give him one... Our vet says they are great for his teeth. The only thing I don't like is that he tends to swallow them whole"
1;"""My buddy (some prudes would say  my master  but my guy is just another big dog to me) bought these chews for me.  We have long walks and long talks and both have better days.  He scratches my ears and that really itchy spot just in front of my tail.  I wag my tail and sleep beside his bed.<br /><br />Anyway"
1;"""My 2 year old Chow-Newfoundland mix loves these dental chews. I give him one each night after I brush his teeth. (His teeth are still sparkly white and people comment all the time on how white his teeth are.) And more importantly"
1;I have used these chews with both a Golden Retriever and Standard Poodle and they love them!  Not only does it give them something safe to chew but they do help clean the teeth.  It's a daily treat in our house.
1;Our veterinarian suggested these for our dog to replace the raw hide chips we were giving him so our dog gets the benefits of the teeth cleaning. I was worried our dog might not like them since the raw hide chips I was buying were heavily coated in flavoring but he actually likes them just as much. These are definitely his favorite treats and I'm happy knowing they also help keep his teeth clean. The package arrived on time from the seller.
1;My dogs absolutely love these.  I have 2 Labradors and they each get 2 a day.  They really keep their teeth clean.  Each time I go to the vet I'm told how clean their teeth are and to keep doing what I am doing.
1;"""I ordered these by mistake actually: I thought I was ordering the rolled tubular chewies our labs are addicted to. But what a fortunate mistake it was--all three dogs love these  chips.  Like potato chips for dogs. The labs take about five minutes each to devour one"
1;"""I am a veterinary student and I can say I really love these chews for dogs.  They are much better quality ingredients than the rawhides in the grocery store and most dogs like them much more.  I can say from experience that my dog prefers them over those.  My dog is a medium size dog but I buy the large chews--they aren't too big and you get more for your money.  He eats them SO fast that I know he really likes them and I can feel better about the quality of what he is eating.  At the end of chewing on these"
1;Wish that this brand was more widely available in stores and Amazon.ca  Great if you aren't able to get enough fresh ingredients to make your own pesto. No metallic taste which you might expect from a metal tube.
1;"""I love this stuff! We use it all the time on back-country trips. It makes a great sauce on on dried pastas alone (or with a little cheese for the gourmet). And it really gives a lot of flavor to bland freeze-dried meals. Well worth its weight. I liked it so much that I even use it at home"
1;"""I have a KerryBlue Terrier who won her Championship several years ago.  We have always been conscious of a nutritional healthy diet.  All at once we were not able to buy the products locally.  I have always been able to find  anything  on Amazon and once again we were successful.  We knew this was a great product"
1;These k-cups were good. It was the delivery charge that I was upset with. Order a large amount to be delivered ASAP and didn't get them on time. I will not order from this site again. Was told by Amazon that they would reemburse me for the delivery charge and I was never compensated. I'll order from another site.

This is a very smooth tasting brew that my wife prefers over the <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK >Coffee People"
1;"""I just received my order from 1 Quick cup of this coffee today and was never so anxious to try a Kcup due to all the raving reviews. I brewed it in my B40 @ the 9.25 mug size and added cream and a sugar substitute. This is a wonderfully blend"
1;Caribou Coffee is one of my favorites in spite of the fact I have to order the regular type online since we don't have any where I live. I ran into these K-cups at Target and thought I'd give them a go.<br /><br />I have occasion to offer people coffee in my office and the K-cup Keurig brewer is perfect for this as it makes just that cup for that person and it's fresh. Without exception everyone I served this too has loved it and asked for the name to purchase for themselves. It is full flavored but not dark and it has a very smooth taste with no bitterness (this is important to me..I find many K-cups to have a bitter aftertaste that affects the aroma of the coffee as well). A normal adding of cream and sugar works fine as well - you don't need more or less than your usual (again helpful when you are making it for clients and such).<br /><br />This is THE favorite for my office and one we will continue to purchase. Enjoy!
1;I completely agree with the previous review - this is outstanding coffee.  I too have tried a lot of the K-Cup varieties and have found this one to be the best.  It has a wonderfully smooth flavor.  It really is a superior cup of coffee!
1;"""I received a Keurig machine for Christmas and was eager to sample all of the coffees that were included.  Unfortunately the Caribou Blend was absent in my sampler.  Lucky for me I decided to pick up a box of this coffee once the sampler was depleted.  I can sum up my experience with one word...  WOW!   This coffee is very smooth but loaded with flavor"
1;"""I have to agree with the other reviews here.  Caribou makes an excellent coffee with a very distinctive taste. I bought this based on reading the other reviews and they were right on in their assessment and am thankful I took the time to read them.  I would encourage everyone to at least take a look at the Keurig site and compare what they have to offer in the way of coffee and prices.  I believe you will be very satisfied.  Free shipping"
1;"""Caribou Coffee Blend is our family's favorite K-Cup flavor. It's strong and smooth in the extra bold package so you can make a max-size cup without it tasting weak. Other flavors we've tried (and like"
1;I have purchased about 12 of Keurig coffee makers for friends and family as presents.  I really enjoy the coffee makers.  All my recipients do.  My favorite variety of coffee is Caribou.  It is bold yet not harsh or bitter. I have tried a lot of varieties and find this the best.  Orders take a day or so more to come but the wait is worth it.
1;"""I just bought the Keurig B70 for my husband (and myself!) for Valentines Day. We opened our brewer and chose the Caribou blend for our first ever K cup. We were surprised at how incredibly good it was! We both enjoy a good cup of medium/dark roast coffee"
1;"""I've loved Caribou Coffee's Caribou Blend ever since my parents got me a Keurig for my birthday a year ago with a sampler of coffees to go with it.  Caribou was my favorite next to Newman's but I find the prices at some places rather off-putting.  When I saw Amazon's deal on them"
1;I'm not a morning person and I need my morning coffee!  I got this coffee at a great price and it was delivered as promised.  Caribou Coffee was just the thing I needed for my mornings to get started.  Using the K-cups was very convenient and made brewing coffee quick and easy.
1;Caribou is the only coffee that I brewed in my Cuisinart Grind and Brew. I was afraid I would not find a comparable coffee once I got my new Keurig but the K cups are wonderful! Very convenient and a good moderately strong coffee. It is one of the top choices I go back to.
1;I tried this for the first time today and I enjoyed it. It had a mild but bold enough flavor for me that I could drink it in the am and have an afternoon cup  when feeling sluggish. No bitterness to it and the smell in the house when it was brewing was as if you were in a Caribou coffee estanlishment.I normally lean towards a more italian or french blend but I really like this. So a great medium roast if that is what you like.
1;"""Caribou Coffee is definitely some of my favorite coffee.  This 80 K-cup pack was perfect and I will probably order it again when I run out (unless I feel adventurous and try some other brands).  Even arrived a day earlier than the  anticipated arrival date ."""
1;"""Our dog is on a lifelong limited ingredient diet due to inflammatory bowel disease.  He eats the venison & potato dry food and gets a low maintenance dose of prednisone.  The IVD (now Royal Canin) food worked well"
1;"""We switched to the Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Venison formula after our vet recommended we try it due to possible food allergies in one of our dogs. After switching we noticed a very definite difference in allergies (mostly ear infections) and our dogs have been on this for years. They're both 75lbs and 11 years and going very strong (hopefully for a long time still!) and I credit a lot of that to their quality food"
1;"""My 5-year old Flat Coated Retriever developed symptoms & was diagnosed with IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease).  He had an allergy spike in his blood work that was  off the charts  in his specialist's words.  A change of food to Venison & Sweet Potato has brought my very sick dog back to himself.  He's on no other medications daily.  Next we're trying the Venison & Sweet Potato treats.<br /><br />Thanks for a superb product."""
1;This is a great natural dog food. Our three dogs really prefer the taste of this food product to any other natural product that we tried. The dogs particularly like the venison or bison flavors over any of the others.
1;"""This particular brand and type of food was recommended by my veterinarian to combat some potential allergic reaction in my Rhodesian mix. One week later and I'm not disappointed. Both of my dogs enjoy the food"
1;"""I started feeding this to my dog when she was a few months old because the poor thing seemed to be allergic to everything and I couldn't figure out what was making her ill.  I've tried many holistic natural brands without any luck.  After feeding my dog this food"
1;"""I was looking for a higher quality dry dog food and did plenty of research on-line.  I found very good evals about Natural Balance so I bought some for my 6-year old German Short-hair.  I bought the Sweet Potato and Venison.  My dog loves it.  No gas or digestive issues at all.<br /><br />Beyond that"
1;My review is for the Buffalo flavor chips.<br />I've had buffalo flavor chips from a variety of brands but Blair's really does reign supreme.<br />Just the right about of heat combined with the tang of buffalo.<br />Ahhhhh...........<br />So tasty.<br />So crunchy.<br />So utterly decadent.<br />So totally bad for you but who cares?<br />One of the best out there and another home run from the master of heat Blair.<br />Highly recommended.
1;"""I love spicy snacks and was looking for something a bit spicier than Flamin Hot Cheetos.  I have several bottles of Blair's hot sauces so I knew that I would definitely not be disappointed with the spice level on these chips.  The first few chips that I put in my mouth"
1;"""Bought these wondering how hot they'll be.. The habanero flavor is hands down the hottest potato chip I've eaten. I'm one who lives for the spice so ive grown madly in love with them.  Definitely would recommend if you like the spice. For those who thinks products like Tabasco or tapatio or siracha is hot"
1;"""Fell in love with these chips years ago when I got outta a vending machine at a previous employer.  They are hotter then any chip I've tried but tastey as all heck.  I research and found out u can only GE these via internet not in any store"
1;My wife and I eat really spicy food. We love the chips since it's pretty spicy. It is a lot spicier than the spicy salsa so I wouldn't reccommend to people who can't eat anything that's spicier than that. I wish there's beef jerky that's this spicy.
1;"""I rarely do product reviews on Amazon BUT after having the 1st bag I knew I had to say something!<br /><br />These chips are not for the faint. They have a wonderful kettle cooked crunch to them and the bag size is the perfect munching snack to watching a movie.  These are not only going to make a good snack for me (as I really like spicy foods) but will also make the perfect laugh when I let friends try them...<br /><br />These chips have a wonderful flavor and not too much spice (if any at all) when you first chomp into a them"
1;Need I say more? These are by far the Hottest (spiciest) Chips I have tried. The burn just keeps on building. Could not eat more then 6 chips without having to drink some water before having more. Only hotter things I have had were Death Valley Desert Buffalo wings from Cluck University.
1;"""All of Blairs products are Great Quality. These are by far the hottest Ive tried & I am about the only one I  know who can eat them. What makes these so good is that the heat is ALL there but there is tons of flavor too! The Parmesean & Cajun are also quite good with a bit less heat! I have bought them by the case On Blairs site"
1;I shared the chips with selected friends that pass for hot heads.  In New Mexico everybody thinks that they qualify but that is not quite true.  I had a blast with the product but apparently I purchased the last box.  I want to purchase four more boxes for Christmas but none are available.  I am disappointed.
1;"""These chips are the hottest I have ever tried so far. At first they taste like a normal kettle cooked chip but then you feel the burn. I usually buy the smaller bags and can never finish them in one sitting...Like the bags says you will  feel alive ."""
1;Best dog food ever!!!  My little brussels griffon was nearly bald with allergies.  I tried everything.  Then I found this dog food.  I wanted an organic food and this one is it.  All others had weird ingredients in them.  Her hair is already growing back.
1;"""I have a 6 year old dachshund that I adopted from another family about 6 months ago (I have another dachshund too). The newly adopted dog had a few problems. She had lost the hair on her ears and they were fairly red on the inside too. She had lost a little hair on her tail as well. She licked her front paws too. Her stool was a light tan color and soft. Her previous owner had her on Iams food and Melatonin pills for her hair loss. I researched thoroughly and decided to try this food. At first I tried the Sweet Pot. & Fish. It smelled a little and my dogs would barely eat it. I switched to the Sweet Pot & Venison and they love it. I can't express what a difference it has made in the adopted dog. I stopped the Melatonin pill too. It took a few weeks"
1;"""My 12 year old mixed breed dog began to have itchy skin  and she would scratch until she had bald spots.  I took her to the vet and he said it was allergies. He thought it was something that I had bathed her in"
1;I like honey mustard but the little bit you get in the store is too expensive. The recipe for making my own chewed up the little can of dry mustard in one use. The price for the little can again means honey mustard is too expensive. With these sized cans I will be making lots of mustard variatons without breaking the bank. My first batch matures in one week. Just in time for basball and hot dogs.
1;I needed to purchase 16-ounce Can of Colman's Mustard Powder.<br />Could not be located locally.  After many weeks of searching<br />decided to try the internet.  Was very satisfied with Amazon<br />purchase. Price and speed of delivery was excellent.
1;Well worth the money. I make hot mustard two the three times a week and that got way exsensive buying the 1 or 2oz. cans at the store. It's the only powder to use when making mustard and it's great in marinades.
1;If your passion resides in the kitchen.If how you communicate your love for the people in your life is by preparing the best you can. This is no compromise. A quality mustard powder that can be modified to cover and satisfy a myriad of tastes and situations.No kitchen would be complete without it.
1;I bought this for a friend in Canada...who has a hard time finding the things she likes to cook with. She said she really loves to cook with Colman's Mustard (would not substitute anything else for it). So...I know she loves it.
1;Bialetti Trends Collections has had my vote since I bought my first ceramic saute pan.  The color of the plum or purple is super.  Looks so great sitting out on top of the stove.  Works even better cooking with it.  Clean up is a breeze.  Will be collecting more of Bialetti Trends in the near future.  Amazon has done a great job on having super items to choose from.  Amazon and Bialetti are a great team.  Thx so much.
1;"""I drink hot tea on most days and have found this one is tasty and sweetens other teas when mixed (I usually make 4 cups at a time & just use one bag of this in the whole batch). It really seems to help if I am feeling a little puffy or bloated. It has a very pleasant taste. The instructions for use are different from ordinary tea"
1;I was skeptical about buying plants online but took a chance because this looked like what I wanted at a bargain price.  The Baby Staghorn Ferns arrived in three days.  Each plant consisted of an inch long plug of soil with three or four leaves the largest being at least 3 inches long.  These were easy to plant and I look forward to watching them grow to full size.  The Orchid Gallery recommends that new plants be kept between 55 and 85 degrees.
1;This product makes a pretty good cup of Earl Grey black tea. It's pretty inexpensive and convenient on par with the traditional earl grey tea bags. You can actually reuse each K-cup 2-3 times and still create good tea without diluting the taste.
1;"""I never dreamed a waffle could be sooo good!! The chocolate malt mix is divine. Reminds me of German chocolate cake. The texture is heavenly. Crisp on the outside and cake-like on the inside. Add bananas"
1;"""My puppy can't seem to get enough of it. She was on Purina puppy chow and barely ate it plus my vet told me it was not healthy for a growing small breed puppy. I researched on line and bought this one. First of all"
1;My poodle/bichon puppy can't get enough of this awesome food.  I switched her to this a few weeks ago and she loves it!  I even use it as a training treat sometimes.  It reduces the waste she produces and seems to digest well also.
1;"""I was feeding my pup the Science Diet Healthy Development dry dog food and she wasn't seeming to each as much as she use to. So I switched to Science Diet Lamb and Rice Meal dry dog food...still just as picky. I have heard great things about Blue Buffalo and decided to give it a shot - she loves it! I've been mixing it half half with the Science Diet food"
1;"""My dogs eat only Blue Baffalo dry dog food. It is the best to feed your puppy or adult dog. It is very healthy and does not contain harmful preservatives that shut down body organs like most dog foods you buy in the grocery stores. I care about my babies' health"
1;"""These B&W cookies are good. They arrived quickly as expected. The texture of the cookies is light and airy. The flavor is not too sweet with a hint of real lemon. The icings stayed perfectly in place and were made with delicious"
1;I have to warn you that you'll likely become addicted to these amazingly delicious biscuits. But you can consume them without a guilty conscience because the ingredients are nutritious. There are several flavors of Almondina biscuits but my favorite is the original one featured here.
1;"""I found these great little cookies looking for anything low-salt in the cookies/cakes/pastry line.  I will admit that eating one is not exactly the same ecstatic experience as eating a really top-quality brownie.<br /><br />But that's a good thing"
1;I dont' like the bitter taste of espresso beans and use this great tasting coffee instead.  It has a lot of flavor and makes the perfect morning pick-me-up-espresso.  Anyone who has ever had a cup of it loves the taste.
1;This is my favorite dried noodles in a cup/bowl. The veggies are actually good and I really like the flavor. The only thing slightly better I think is Annie Chun's where the noodles don't start completely dry.
1;"""I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING WITH TEA'S SINCE OCTOBER OF 2010 AND I'D HAVE TO GIVE THIS TEA A FIVE + STAR!!!! NOT ONLY FOR ITS TASTE BUT FOR THE PRICE AS WELL. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST TEA IVE EVER HAD. I AM SO ADDICTED TO IT NOW"
1;"""For years I have been getting  Miss Rona's  Lavender tea.<br />However that company closed.<br />I've tried a couple of others that didn't come close.<br />This Stash Lavender tea is outstanding and relaxing."""
1;"""This is one of my favourite teas.  My mom had picked up some a couple summers ago so that I'd have some tea to drink while visiting her.  I've had a horrible time finding it locally.  I've been drinking Stash's black chai spice instead"
1;"""Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea"
1;I love this tea and drink it most mornings. Ginger and lemon are good for digestion and thins mucus plus I get some antiocidants from the green tea.<br /><br />I have trouble finding this tea at the grocery stores and was delighted to find it online.
1;This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced. I am now spoiled for any other green teas! The price here with subscribe and save is much less expensive than at the local store.
1;I drink this tea after every dinner and it's very refreshing. The fact that it's organic makes its so much better. It only tastes good to me when it's hot though. When its cold or lukewarm it just tastes like toothpaste water.
1;I use a lot of different flavoured herbal teas and I usually look for a stonger flavoured tea and this is a good one..<br />it also adds a little yest when combining with other herbals. which I enjoy doing...
1;I've not been a big tea drinker but wanted to be because of all the health benefits. I now drink this tea everyday and it energizes me. I can't wait each morning to drink this tea. It has just the right combination of light mint flavor to make it refreshing. The white tea doesn't stain the teeth as readily as other teas and it's very high in antioxidants.
1;This is excellent tea..  I'm glad it's organic that way I can not only enjoy the taste but the benifits as well.. I was surprised how well this tea taste.  I orginally baught for my stomach but I'm taking a liking to the taste as well.  This is now my 2nd favorite Stash tea..
1;I was looking for a mild flavored tea that I could use to make a lemon tea and this organic chamomile tea is perfect. It does have a lovely aroma but I don't like drinking it without adding the juice of half a lemon and a packet of stevia. Then I add a little honey. I'd recommend using two tea bags for one cup or mug.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
1;"""I have been drinking this tea blend for over a year and never grow tired of it.  Love the blended flavor and the oil of bergamot.  Being organic and fair trade certified is also a plus. To those of you who have tasted earl grey black and green teas separately and are curious about the mix--I would say the black tea flavor predominates"
1;A fantastic blend. Also tastes quite good brewed cold! For this reason I take them on backpacking trips with me: it lets me have something quite tasty in the morning before I'm awake enough to get water on the boil.
1;"""I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag"
1;The Earl Grey and Green tea mix is very smooth and a nice delicate flavor from the bergamot oil.<br />A nice way to start or end a day!  I enjoy this in the evening with my treat of Chocolove 70% cocoa<br />strong dark chocolate.  Ends every day nicely.
1;"""I drink Green tea most of the day. After 5:00pm or so I switch to camomile tea. It keeps me calm and promotes better sleep at night.<br /><br />I tried several teas and this is one of my favorite taste-wise.<br /><br />Being a Baby Boomer I am more aware of natural ways to stay healthy and enjoy life. I'm always looking for ways to improve without artificial products.<br /><br />If your nerves get jittery then you want to give this tea a try.<br /><br />Lambert Klein Author of <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BSGY8Y >Anti-Aging for Baby Boomers and Everyone Else Naturally</a>"""
1;This is one of my favorite teas. It has green tea but tastes only<br />like black tea. And it's organic. When I could no longer find it in<br />the stores near me I bought it through Amazon at a price less than<br />stores used to sell it for.
1;It's organic that is the first great thing. It is not just black tea. The green tea mellows it out. The spices are just right. Try it with a little sweetner and milk. Definitely better/healthier than highly sweetened mixes.
1;"""This chicken base is the best I have ever used. Great hardy flavor. No need to buy broth. Makes the best chicken soup and chicken and dumplings. Add to make chicken gravy. I used to buy this when I lived in Buffalo"
1;This is great whole flower tea of very high quality at an affordable price. would highly recommend this if you like hibiscus tea. brews a deep crimson red and has a wonderful flavor and arrived very quickly.
1;This was the best value that I found online. Received my product quickly and evertything was in order. I'll definitely order from this company again because the dried hibiscus flowers were full and looked great. Can't wait to make the Caribbean drink known as sorrel!
1;My dogs love this item and the other Chunky Chews.  They chew on them forever!  It's like giving them the world when they see me pull them out of the box.  I have 4 dogs from medium size to extra large (120 lbs.) and they all love them.  They cannot chew these up in no time like they can other rawhide chews from other companies.  I definitely recommend buying any of the Chunky Chews!  They are also great because you don't have them swallowing pieces of rawhide and choking it back up - they actually have to chew on these to get anywhere!  Love them and will definitely buy them again!
1;"""My dog loves them.  She is a 50 lb aussie and these are just the right size.  She clearly prefers them to any others we have given her... and this dog has gone through many bones in her day!  They are much thicker rawhide than some of the cheap ones you can get at the grocery store.  I like that they are natural too.  A little pricey"
1;"""This is really good jerky. The pieces are nice and thick and have just enough gristle in it to leave you with something to chew for a while. That's half the reason I like jerky. This actually helps the bag last longer since you don't rush right onto the next piece! It has a barbeque coating with a good flavor and a semi-spicy after bite. The pieces are thick enough that they don't disintegrate in the bag so that the last half of the bag isn't smaller  crumbs . I'd buy this again and as a matter of fact I think I will right now!"""
1;The flavor of the sweet & hot is the best spicy jerky I have yet to find. It is also very tender. The only issue I have is sometimes you get quite a few pieces in a row that have alot of grisel in them.
1;"""When I first encountered these Cowboy Strips I as a bit confused. Were they in fact made of beef or cowboy? Since cannibalism hasn't generally been in practice for quite some time (and even when it was"
1;Wild Ride Beef Jerkey is incredibly tender and flavorful.  Most jerky products I've tried in the past are like flavored shoe leather - WFBJ is definitely heads and shoulders above all the others.  There's actually some substance to it - and the fact that it's low fat with NO preservatives is a big selling point for me!  If you like spicey - try the Black Pepper one ------
1;"""I have tried many many many beef jerky products but this WILD RIDE beef jerky is the best tasting product I have ever eaten.  It is both flavorful and moist and gave me the protein boost that I look for in my beef jerky snack.  I also liked the price"
1;Wild Ride Jerky is definitely my favorite jerky on the market right now. This jerky is great because it is not only a healthier alternative to many other beef jerkies on the market but the taste is far superior.  I'll never go back to the other brands!
1;"""This is true jerky not the kind that looks stamped or processed. This being said because of the natural variances of beef some pieces are smaller or contain a trace of fat or may be grisly but this is not a common occurrence. I purchase 4 pkgs of this per month and have been for 8 months. In my opinion"
1;I ordered the pepper one and sent it to my son in Afghanistan. He loved it. He doesn't ask for much when he's deployed but does love jerkey. I bought this because it came in a 1 lb package. He told me this was the best he's ever had and not to buy the Jack Link's any more. Must be really good for him to like it that well.
1;Seriously delicious. Not sure where the bad reviews are coming from but this stuff is one of the better tasting jerkys I have ever had. The balance of the spice and sweetness is spot on. It seemed rather fresh. This stuff is just plain good. My only complaint is that it wasn't in bigger pieces and that I wish it didn't have so many scrap/small pieces. Not enough to deduct stars because the taste is there.
1;I used to get this at a local major sporting goods store. They stopped carrying it. Thought it was gone forever until I decided to shop the web and here it was. I am a regular customer now getting it thru Amazon.
1;The price is great. The product is very good. I liked the barbeque flavor one the best so far. I don't know if everyone out there would like this type of jerky or not. But the pieces were soft and chewy and I liked it.
1;These are great!  There is no added sugar but they are packed with flavor and sweetness. My daughter loves them.  She is eight months old. We break them in half for her so she can swallow them easily.  We love the fact they have no added sugar and are all natural!!!!
1;I use these beans in an espresso machine. I love the taste of straight espresso coffee but find that too much caffeine stresses me out. This coffee tastes great as an espresso. I subscribe to this coffee through Amazon and receive an order each month at a 15% discount with free shipping. A good deal.
1;"""Sometimes I have low blood sugar.  Several times my blood sugar dropped so low as to concern my doctors.  I asked what I could do and the diabetic nurse suggested I keep some pure apple juice available.  I found Motts to be a reliable brand.<br /><br />Motts Apple Juice suggests  8 ounces as a serving.  The nurse suggested that 4 Ounces should be my first dose.  Four ounces of apple juice has 15 grams of carbs and 13 grams of natural sugar.  I discovered that the 4 oz.  serving reliably raises my blood sugar 25 points"
1;"""I bought this for my wife to take to restaurants as they almost never have a LIGHT version of dressings.  Either regular or no fat.  And we all know how no fat tastes!  She is VERY picky about her ranch dressing"
1;So many ranch dressings that are low-fat or lower calorie taste terrible.  Not so with Heinz Ranch dressing.  It is so easy to keep two or three packets in my purse so that I always have them with me when eating out.  No now worry about spoiling a salad with the dressing offered by the resturant!  Thanks for a great product
1;Very pleased with these arrangements.<br />They were beautiful plants and very colorful vases for our<br />shower centerpiece.  Everyone remarked how special they<br />were and the lucky winners were happy to take them home.
1;"""I recently purchased a giant bag of these at Costco after they had samples out to try. I was blown away at how good they were and bought two bags. I don't live close to Costco and now wish I bought more when I was up there. You have to try these chips they are so good. They are not too salty and they are very crispy. They are a little corny as well as a little grainy and naturally slightly sweet. Very best chips I've had"
1;"""I had the pleasure to experience these chips for the very first time at a weekend retreat recently.  Hands down -- the BEST chips ever!  Lots of flavor alone -- but incredible with Humus!  The shipping charge on this page is twice what the chips cost -- so I will continue my search locally.  But"
1;We've been giving our baby different varieties of these melts since he was around 8 months old.  He absolutely loves every single flavor and would eat the whole bag if I let him.  I use them mainly for snacks on the go and the resealable bag makes it easy to toss in our diaper bag.  I usually buy a lot of my baby items from Amazon but I actually get these from the grocery store because they are much cheaper than here.
1;I have just put my 3rd paella in the oven from packets in this mix. I find it to be just the right amount of seasoning. I have been complimented by my friends on just how good it tastes. A very satisfied customer here
1;"""My 4 1/2 month old 3.7lb yorkshire terrier LOVE!LOVE!LOVE Nature's Variety Medallions. So far he has tried the chicken and beef. He was a picky eater to begin with and was starting to get alarmingly thin because he won't eat his kibble. I tried topping it with different things like plain yogurt and nothing. He still won't eat his kibble. I decided to try the raw medallions and he eats with so much gusto! Also he has gained some weight (a great thing) and looks so much healthier now. His coat is looking better and better everyday. Also his poop is so much smaller. I noticed that the goop from his eyes is slowly disappearing. It is pricier than kibble"
1;This is a great product!  Your dog's body uses more of the food and less waste!  Happier dog and happier family.  But - the cost here is really ridiculous.  Buy at [...] and pay for shipping  - you will be saving lots of money and helping the small business economy!  Plus these are really nice people!<br /><br />JanSimpson
1;This is what we brew at work.  I love that Amazon offers the 12 pack.  This product is my boss' fave and I like that I can order it and have it delivered to our door.  It's a great tasting coffee for the price.
1;Price is very close to what I found it priced in stores (when I could find it in stores in my area - not now).  This is the BEST flavor for the money!  Very appreciative that Amazon makes it available!!!
1;These beans are just about perfection.  They are firm yet tender and the flavor is exactly right.  The large packages are easy to store and make a great addition to lots of meals.  Thanks for a nearly perfect product.
1;a strong and smooth coffee. one of the darkest that kicking horse delivers. we use it in our espresso machine. nothing else compares for a strong but NOT bitter latte. we've tried tons and always come back to this one. highly recommended.
1;"""I like the Kicking Horse brand of coffees and Three Sisters is my usual all-day choice. There comes a time when one needs a bit more power to start the day and 454 Horse Power totally punches the starter! The full body & flavor with low acidity is true. There is no  burnt sox  smell to these beans. Its a dark and rich blend with excellent flavor. I have tried several cans of the Kick Ass Dark with no complaints but no real bonding either. The 454 Horse Power Dark is perfect for when a richer"
1;I really love the darkness of this coffee. It is well balanced but still packs a good punch. I'm hoping Amazon starts selling it in the 2.2lb bags soon since I already have a ton of the empty canisters and would like to refill and reuse them.
1;"""I love this coffee!  Had it first in Canada and checked on Amazon when I got back home.  I get monthly whole bean delivery.<br />Have tried a few of the Kicking Horse blends and it's always satisfying .  Full"
1;"""I just finished up my first large cup of 454 and was blown away!  Man... this is good stuff.  My wife also commented about how tasty it was...  very very tasty  I believe were her exact words.  I can only hope the next cup continues to impress.<br /><br />If you're the type of person who likes to 'pour a little coffee' into their milk and sugar it might not be for you.  It's strong enough to clean your socks while wearing them!<br /><br />I think I'll get that second cup right now...."""
1;This is a great deal because my local big box store with LOW prices sells a packet of this cocoa for .99 each.  My favorite flavors are all here.  I love how this has powdered milk built into the ingredients so that this cocoa does not *have* to be made with poured milk in order to taste extra rich.  Generally I just make this with boiling water.  Their taste is superior than the average grocery store hot cocoa offerings.  These are a real treat and taste like hot cocoa from a coffeehouse.
1;"""This brand of chips has been my favorite since I found them down in Pennsylvania when I used to travel that way.  A few years ago they started to sell them in New England and I was thrilled!  I've been buying them weekly since they made there appearance.<br /><br />But now I found I have entered those years were I have to watch my salt intake and the first thing to go was my beloved chips.  I have been depressed.  UNTIL I found quit by accident via Amazon that Herr's makes a lower salt chip.  And it is delicious.  I have been buying  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052Y7YL2 >Lay's Lightly Salted Potato Chips 10 oz</a> and while they are good"
1;"""I recently went to dinner at a Moroccan restaurant and has the most delicious fruit salad there.  What made the dish so special was the combination of orange blossom water and mint that the fruit pieces were stewed in.  I bought this product to recreate the dish"
1;"""This green tea has an excellent flavor and is one of four Lipton teas that we keep in our pantry. The taste is flavorful and distinctive and is a favorite for afternoon tea time.<br /><br />We alternate between this green tea"
1;"""The BBQ Chicken Mi Goreng flavor packs on the heat...and just right for those who like their food on the intense side.  It has lots of packets of flavor including a spicy chili oil and soy sauce and some msg-powdered seasoning and hot chili powder and even dehydrated fried onions as garnish.<br /><br />It is subtly sweet and the spicy-heat just hits you in every bite and the flavors all merge into deliciousness.  This is a flavor unlike any asian bistro cooking"
1;"""I really like this drink. Especially when it is really chilled. I really enjoy it for several reasons. The first is that is taste like mocha coffee - not chocolate milk someone served in a coffee cup! It has just the right blend of coffee and mocha.<br />The other thing I really like about this drink is that it is only 100 calories! The ingredients list is:<br />Coffee (water"
1;"""I love Jack Links Beef Steaks. These have a wonderful flavor with just the right blend of spices and hickory flavoring. I have trouble eating just one. It makes a great snack anytime. Before letting my grandkids know I have some"
1;This is a sooo much better snack than crackers or chips.  I have blood sugar issues and a protein snack is just what I need.  I also quit smoking in Jan. 2007 and am still smoke free thanks to Jack Links 2 oz. Original Beef Steak.  I honestly love them.
1;These jerky packs are great.  They actually do fill you up or at least stop the grum bellies.  I stay away from all the products that are just different ways of eating sugar and corn syrup.  I have a boy with ADD and I don't have him on drugs so it is very nice to have a great tasting and filling snack that isn't just sugar with flavoring.  Since sugar and corn syrup are major contributors to that condition.  Keep up the good work Jack Link.
1;"""I picked one of these up at a convenience store for a snack. It was just the right amount for a mid-meal bite. I bought a whole box from Amazon to keep in the office. Other reviewers said that they thought these were too salty"
1;"""We all know Jack Link's is an excellent product. Dates were excellent and you will never find a better price anywhere so go ahead sign up for autoship and enjoy healthy protein anytime.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GW0U3E >Jack Link's Beef Steak"
1;I love Jack Links Beef Steak and this has to top them all. I only ordered 1 box and will definately order more. I very highly recommend the peppered beef steak. A perfect blend of pepper and spices with a smoked flavor make this a great anytime snack.
1;This tea should be called an adaptagen.  It picks me up when I need it. I drink it every night before I go to bed and put the tea in my smoothies as a base. Great! I would recommend and have recommended this tea to friends and family
1;This is my absolute favorite mustard. Not only does it taste great but it brings back memories of when I was stationed in Germany. I have one big question though. Do I need to keep it in the refrigerator after I open it? This is the first time I buy this mustard in this tube packaging. Usually I get it in a jar. Can anyone help me out with this question. The seller shipped it on time and everything but I didn't see a phone number to contact them directly with this question.
1;I love a good reach black tea in the morning and this is it. Strong but not overpowering with a nice smoothness. I like this better than the other assam teams I hve in my cupboard and you can't beat the price.
1;I love the sauce for this product.  I was concerned about the comments of not being enough sauce for the noodles provided but did not find this to be an issue. Adding a bit of soy to the final prepartion stage helped.  I made this with uncooked shrimp and it was delicous.  You do need to be prepared to have on hand what other ingredients you wish to add (including peants) - the box only has noodles and sauce.  I plan to try it with tofu as well.<br /><br />The first time I made this dish I followed the directions and used hot tap water on the noodles and the second time I used some recently boiled water.  The boilded water made the noodles stick together and I had a hard time getting them to separate.  When I used the hot tap water I did not have this problem.  I suggest placing them in the water a bit at a time so the potential sticking won't happen.<br /><br />Plenty of food for two! I will definately buy this again.
1;My cats love these. They are very hard to find anywhere but here. They used to be available in the pet stores but no longer. Must refrigerate after opening. They are a little pricy but a healthy treat for your cat.
1;Our siamese flips out for this. She doesn't eat a lot in general but she loves these. They are crazy expensive but they never go to waste like other cat food and treats. Ellen DeGeneres is making millions i'm sure with her Halo products!
1;If you are looking for a seasoning that is similar/identical to the one at outback steak house then this is the one. If you are a person who has blood pressure issues and you are looking for a salt free spicy seasoning then this is perfect. I use this without adding salt and it taste great. It is spicy but not too spicy or over powering.
1;I bought this for a local VFW.  The cook uses it on pork chops and steak.  People say the pork chops are the best they have tasted.  The cook uses it as a dry rub and places it on the pork chops four (4) hours before grilling or deep-frying depending on the customers order.
1;When I was a child my mother would put a Clark bar in my lunch bag as a special treat.  I was so thrilled when I found them on your web site because I had not found them in any stores in my area.  They taste as good now as they did all those years ago.  Yum.  Thanks.
1;This is the BEST product made for tacos/burritos. You compare the ingredients and this is SOOOO much better for you and the taste is not your regular taco seasoning mix. It's bursting with flavor and not spicy as most people may think. I will NEVER purchase any other taco seasoning ever again.
1;I eat a lot less meat than I used to but want it to be tasty when I do.  A pound of beef with Chipotle Taco lasts me for a week.  I use a little in an omelette (best ever) or over a baked sweet potato topped with mesclun and salsa (low fat and high taste)These two are my favorites but the idea is that 3 ounces of this sauce makes just about any meal more interesting.  I really appreciate the all natural quality of the product.
1;"""This is the best taco mix  North of the Border ! I travel to Mexico very frequently and recognize good authentic Mexican taste. This Chipotle Taco Mix by Nueva Cocina is simply the easiest and the best."""
1;"""I make tacos about once a week and I am so glad I found these after having to convert to a gluten free lifestyle. The chipotle is the spiciest of the 3 but I really don't think any of them are too spicy. The raisins are good in this one too"
1;"""I grew up in Texas and I used to make my own taco seasoning. Once I was in a rush and bought this on a whim because the packaging was so appealing. This was so much better than anything I'd made on my own. Now this is all I use. This is great on ground beef"
1;"""My family LOVES this taco seasoning!  We really enjoy the levels of flavor that you just don't get in the regular stuff from the supermarket.  I've completely switched from ground beef in tacos and taco salad to ground chicken or turkey"
1;"""This seasoning mix takes taco salad or tacos to a whole new level.<br /><br />I brown meat in a little olive oil and then add this seasoning.  I do not add the tomato sauce as shown on the instructions.  After adding the spice to the meat"
1;I love Pop Secret Homestyle popcorn and cannot find it anywhere near my home so I decided to order it from Amazon.  I got my purchase undamaged and in a timely fashion and will continue to order this product from Amazon.  Thank you for great service!  Meloney Knighton
1;Great treat for a US military team stationed overseas in a team house.  Even non-bakers will summon the courage to make and bake these cookies for a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie treat.  We ordered a case!
1;"""We don't get to eat cookies very often but when we have company over we bake fresh cookies.  These Betty Crocker's Walnut Chocolate Chip cookies are as good as it gets.  If you follow the directions for making them as it specifies you get a cookie that is every bit as good as any homemade style cookie you can bake.  In about 20 minutes from start to finish you're done and your guests are happy.  You had better make two batches as the life span of these cookies just out of the oven is very short.  They are so good warm you will have trouble getting them to last.<br /><br />They are ideal with milk"
1;I bought these chocolate baseballs to add to favor bags for my son's baseball themed birthday party. They were perfect! I waa not expecting them to be as delicious and fresh as they were. Also shipped quickly.
1;"""These unsalted cashews were far better tasting than I expected. They have some sort of light seasoning on them that makes them so tastly that I cannot quit eating them. They are so much better than other unsalted cashews that I have tried. I am supposed to eat about an ounce of nuts a day. I'm embarrassed to tell you that the first container I opened"
1;"""These are individually wrapped and there are approximately 15 cookies in each box. They have a nice flavor and are fresh and crispy. The fortunes are standard fortune cookie fare. Very few of these were broken during shipping. I definitely recommend these if you like fortune cookies. They are a low-calorie"
1;Thick hearty noodles that don't get soggy too fast are pleasant to chew. The soup is slightly more thick than the regular soup but not at an absurd level. One dissapointment is that I can't find any bits of corn in here despite it making an appearance on the box. Also no bits of chicken.
1;I have a friend who used to drink a coconut coffee which she loved but hasn't been able to find it in years. I wanted to try and find her another coconut coffee that she would enjoy but didn't want to buy a whole box of one kind in case she didn't like it. I saw this sampler and thought it would be a perfect choice as she would be able to try four different kinds. She was thrilled to receive this sampler (which came sooner than Amazon had said it would!)! She loved all four flavors and now has some new favorite coconut coffee!!
1;"""I love the variety of tastes and textures Earth's Best offers. The gourmet meals selection was fabulous. My son devoured everything with a smile!! I do suggest getting the subscribe and save if your child is a big eater like mine. And as always"
1;"""This is just an excellent coockie for babies and toddler. Really the best you can offer to your little one. These coockies are not only delicious but are rich in vitamins calcium and protein and low in fat. I am sorry that the other Plasmon products (i.e."
1;I am finishing the set of tea flowers I got and will order more.  Some of the little buds didn't have any real color to them but their taste is really divine.  It is one of those things you do when you listen to Asian music and are in a peaceful state.  Each bud makes about six cups.
1;This candy is the best. Being sugar free I find the taste to be as close to ones loaded with sugar. Wonderful item for a diabetic The barrel last a long time and well worth the money. I will be ordering more.  Just received my second order of this item. It is as good as the first. So i will be ordering many more packages.
1;I have never been a tea drinker.  I drink tea in the summer cold.  I had the opportunity to have this tea at a little sandwich shop a couple of weeks ago.  The waitress recommeded the tea.  I was blown away by this tea.  It has an amazing scent while it is steeping. Very berry in flavor with delicious other ingredients.  I have been raving about this tea to everyone who will listen.  I can't wait to try this over ice this summer.  I don't think you will be disappointed.
1;"""My seven cats just love this food and I am always looking for the new batch of 4 cases to come in because it is always fresh and they (cats) know the difference.  Thank you for great service and fantastic food for my seven babies. They also like seafood supreme but not as much as the Cod"
1;"""I love this tea!!! I have lost weight 2 times using it as an  assistant . The first time I lost close to 50 lbs then I got pregnant. After I was done breastfeeding my son I got back on the tea and a diet and lost about 50 lbs again. It is amazing stuff. It cleanses your blood"
1;It was very easy to assemble this cupcake stand.  It was able to hold 2 trays of cupcakes easily.  It was durable and there was no worry of the cupcakes falling off!  The design is very cute and my daughter loved it!
1;Light in flavor but still very good. If your trying to stay away from the ramen soup loaded with so much sodium then this is your answer. The noodles are thin rice noodles and on the package it says these are good for those on a vegan diet. I do add a small finely chopped mushroom or some sort of small piece of veggie and it's very filling.
1;"""I bought these flowers for Mothers Day. I order these flowers early thinking it would take at least a week to get them. They came two days later!! I thought oh no there not going to look good on Mothers Day"
1;"""This is my first experience with Yerba Mate. I love this stuff! It is very fresh tasting. I have tried it hot and cold. I prefer it cold in my travel mug. I place some in my travel mug under the mesh strainer"
1;"""This Santa Cruz soft baked oatmeal raisin cookie is one of the best ever. They flavor it with wonderful spices that make me think i'm eating holiday pastry. When I put out a plate of cookies they are always the first to go. I call them the adult cookie that children love. The price is good and delivered to my door"
1;"""Another delicious selection in the Pepperidge Farm family of Cookies called Santa Cruz Oatmeal Raisin. I picked up my order for a great bargain through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for only $7.49!!! When you consider that these normally cost you listed on bag @ $3.49/per"
1;"""These have to be my favorite cookies of all time! I've gifted boxes to family and friends and every person that has tried them has wiped out the box within a day. The Milk Chocolate Lace is definitely the best"
1;"""A friend suggested that I try Poppies Cookies and this is some of the best advice she has ever given me.  Poppies Cookies are a staple in my pantry and any event that I host.  The cookies never fail to impress"
1;These are great cookies - a treat when a treat is what is needed. Can't eat just one. Unless it is the one bag of them. I don't like crunchy cookies in general but these are the exception. The are not completely crunchy - they have a bit of a shortbread texture to them to soften that crunch a bit. Lovely chocolate - and that is very important to me. When I make homemade chocolate chip cookies (that my Dad says are the best of everyones) I use only the best chocolate chips (Ghirardelli or Scharffen Berger. These are a great substitute when I don't feel like baking!!
1;"""Outstanding melt in your mouth chocolate.  The dark chocolate is not bitter like many chocolatiers - it has the perfect blend of taste for any chocoholic.  I've had many different types of chocolate from Belgium and can guarantee - Leonidas is the  Mercedes-Benz  of chocolatiers.  The general assortment is an outstanding sampling of ivory"
1;These chocolates are one of the very best one can get. The problem is the price in the USA.<br /><br />In Belgium they cost only 16.50 Euros a Kilo (approx 2.2 lbs)= USD 22.00.<br /><br />Transport is expensive because they travel cooled...
1;"""When I thinkof the richest chocolates I usually thinkof fine Belgian chocolates. Lately I needed some small thank you gifts. The chocolate ballotins arrived in TWO days without express delivery. Thanks to fresh product and fine packaging the chocolates could not have arrived as they did: in perfect shape. My friends were very thrilled and even grudgingly gave me a nibble. This selection contained mostly liquid centers with shells ranging from thick to thin"
1;"""My friend went to Belgium and brought us back this chocolate. I am not crazy about chocolate BUT I fell in LOVE with this one!  This is EXCELLENT chocolate!  The assortment varies so if you like a certain assortment"
1;"""We lived in Belgium for a number of years.  Tasting these wonderful chocolates took me back.....  The chocs. themselves were delicious with all the sorts of fillings I enjoy.  I also enjoyed the different chocolate surrounding the centres.  Leonidas was a regular part of our lives and hope that I can enjoy these little luxuries again"
1;I have never ever tasted a finer and more delicious chocolate in my entire life. The only thing I would ask Leonidas Belgian Chocolates to do is make up some chocolates with whole almonds in them. That would be the best of both worlds.
1;I placed the order on a tuesday and it was delivered the very next day. The chocolates were absolutely wonderful and incredibly delicious. Will be ordering again definitely.<br /><br />The packaging was beautiful and for the price i feel that the chocolates are of a very high quality. i would recommend this product esp as a gift for your GF.
1;"""I am so glad Kraft makes organic mac & cheese!<br />Tastes just like their regular mac & cheese.<br /><br />A welcoming aspect for those going or gone organic!<br />Especially since most healthy foods are lacking in taste.<br /><br />A delicious side dish or even as the main dish.<br />An excellent source of protein!<br /><br />Being organic it is healthier for you"
1;"""Sometimes you just have to throw caution to the wind and enjoy life a bit. I don't think anyone in their right minds would recommend this product as the beginning and end of all meals that should be fed to children on a daily bases. (Unfortunately"
1;"""My kids love Kraft Macaroni & Cheese.  A few years back I decided to stop buying most packaged products to avoid ingredients that I did not want to feed my family.  I started buying organic whenever possible.  There are other organic mac & cheese products on the market"

1;"""The color and taste are slightly different in Kraft's organic Mac & Cheese compared to their classic version.  It is slightly lighter and the cheese is missing that  fakish  artificial cheese taste that so many of us love.  (It tastes more like real cheese.)  But it's not a drastic taste difference like some of the organic Mac&Cheese have.<br /><br />Once I got over the difference"

1;I'm currently working in Afghanistan for a private military contractor. I ordered a box of these bad boys on a whim and they arrived in a blur! What did I do next? I stuck that stuff in the FREEZER dude!!! 24 hour later I was in popsicle heaven bro. Grapes my favorite
1;I gave it 4 stars due to its size. Was quite small then pictured. It's seems smaller then 17.85 oz as indicated but can't be too sure. It is good honey and love the sweet taste. I got it for the H. Pylori which I was diagnosed with about 2 weeks ago. I read that this natural honey kills them. Lets see if that is true. Will update.<br /><br />7/18/12 Updating my initial comment above and now giving it a 5 stars because it cured my H. Pylori. Went and got retestedd and came up negitive. I did not take any antibiotics either. It also helped with my seasonal allergies. Very good honey. I just use it when drinking tea which I do regularly. It is quite expensive but worth every dollar. Give it a try won't dissapoint.
1;"""The label says  ...has a strong rich flavor with overtones of caramel and malt.   I call it a smoky flavor and found the perfect use for it-- BBQ.  Now I use Airborne brand Manuka honey exclusively to make BBQ tofu and chicken with a little garlic and red pepper.  Delicious!!  No other honey will do."""
1;"""I just received my 12 pack of Acai Pomegranate Vita Coco Coconut Water from Amazon.<br /><br />Wow!! I love the new twist off cap!! I have been waiting for Vita Coco to come out with a more user friendly packaging (to work out with). Now I can go to yoga and open and close my drink"
1;For anyone looking for a healthy alternative to the current slew of electrolyte replacement drinks on the market - you have just found your holy grail of thirst quenchers.  The drink when served ice cold is extremely refreshing and healthy at the same time.  I love the fact that is has 15 times the potassium of other drinks on the market but is completely natural.  Vitacoco has no sugar added so someone looking for an extremely sweet experience will be let down.<br /><br />As for the previous reviewer who said this flavor tastes like watered down tomato juice - I just don't taste it.  It has a hint of pomegranate and acai flavor but the coconut water still comes through clean and strong.  He was probably just not expecting the taste you get from coconut water - which granted is different - but look at the state of health overall in this country and you will agree different is just what we need!!!<br /><br />What more can I say - all natural coconut juice with no preservatives or additives and a hint of real juice flavor.  Delicious and refreshing.
1;I love this marmalade from the first time I purchased it at a close-out store.  I loved it so much I went back to purchase every jar they had only to find they had no more.  I went on line in search for it and was thrilled to find Amazon as a source.
1;I grew up eating Snickers candy bars. Love them. But do you know what I love even more? Snickers Almond Bar! I have no idea why but they taste better than the original. Maybe it's the almonds or maybe it's something else but the Snickers almond bar taste great! Try one!
1;If you like almonds chocolate and caramel this product is for you. I was very pleased with the product shipping was fast and product arrived in great condition. Price was excellent saved probably 50 cents per bar. I have always been an amazon fan and customer and have yet to have any issue. Buying in bulk is definately the way to go.
1;"""After years of abdominal pain my wife broke down and told her doctor  get rid of this damn gall bladder . Everytime she was in pain the docs would say  gall bladder  but the tests would come back normal. Anyway"
1;"""Mambas bring me back to when mamma used to take us to the five and dime store and spend our whole allowance ($1) on these delicious little treats. I am 34 now and i still LOVE em'. I agree with the reviewer before me"
1;This is the best mix we have found.  Makes great bread sticks and wonderful calzones! I make a batch and freeze it until were ready to have it then cook it.  It works well in our toaster oven as well as our regular oven.  My daughter and I can't eat gluten.  We both really missed bread stuff.  This is a perfect replacement!  We have used other chebe mixes and have not been disappointed.  Everyone who is GF knows things have a different taste and texture but this is really close to the old things we used to love.  I think you will like it as well. This was an especially great find to help make the transition for my 5 year old.  If she give it a thumbs up you know it's got to be good!!
1;Amazing!!  Have tried other pizza crust recipes but this is the best!  It is quick and tastes great.  I have tried most of the Chebe products and have never been disappointed.  I love the fact that the crust is seasoned
1;"""Ok so the first few times I tried this product I had mixed feelings. After a few additional tries I figured out the best way to make the crust. First instead of the 2 tablespoons of oil you will use about 1/4 cup. Don't add it all at once. Instead use your fork to mix the crust and after it is ready to knead you will slowly add the oil till you get a gum like texture. Whatever you are using to cook it on (I use a pizza stone) oil it. When you put the dough on the spread (I do mine by hand) fold it over itself a few times to start it. Then you will move it to the edges. You will have extra dough a the edges but make sure that you get the inner areas as thin as possible. If you do not this will result in the dough not cooking all the way through. You can either remove some of the extra dough around the edges or leave it (I leave mine and I love it). If you leave it"
1;"""We picked up a few bags of this pizza crust mix when our daughter was first diagnosed with Celiac disease 3 years ago.  The whole extended family  - including some really picky eaters all enjoyed this gluten free pizza.  However"
1;I eat gluten free and gave up pizza long ago. When I discovered chebe pizza dough I was so happy. I like it better than regular dough. I do suggest that you bake your pizza crust for about 8 min before your put on your toppings.
1;"""I made a pizza with this last night and I found myself thrilled with it.  It smelled unbelievable while it baked before I even put on the toppings. My husband even loved it.  I let him try a piece of the pizza before telling him it was gluten free. He said he would never had guessed"
1;"""We have been creating GF pizza at home now for several years thanks to Chebe.  You have to be fairly accurate with your measurements or it is a challenge to correct and oversight.  It is best to thoroughly cook the dough on both sides before you add your toppings.  The consistency is great because it has allowed us to add any additional spices that we choose to the dough.  Out of the various GF doughs that we have tried"
1;trying out gluten free options..i found this pizza crust.<br /><br />OH so good we make up two pizzas a week for the family.<br /><br />and now use our Oven Stone (highly recomend you do so as well)..it crisps the crust up SO well!<br /><br />TY Chebe a Crust i can comsume *big ol grin*
1;We have found that if we don't put in the optional 1 cup of cheese the crust is crisper.  We roll the dough as thin as we can (if it sticks to the counter we rub a little olive oil on the counter) and then put it in the oven for 5 minutes before adding the toppings.  Then add the toppings and put the completed pizza in the oven for 15 minutes.  Chebe bread makes great pizza crust!
1;My wife has celiacs disease and this is about the only Pizza crust that makes a good gluten free pizza.<br /> I like this pizza crust better then most wheat pizzas.<br /><br />The dough is easy to work with and roll out. It is NOT sticky as most gluten free crust mixes are and tastes GREAT!
1;"""Before I discovered this product I had all but given up on pizza.  The only way I got good pizza is if I went to a local place that actually made gluten free pizzas... but they were also sadly around $15 for a personal pan sized one.  Since I have discovered this I have pizza again!  Chebe uses tapioca flour as their main flour ingredient and it is flour I highly prefer.  It creates a chewy crust that can also be thinned out and baked crisp.  I have also used this mix rolled out really thin to create crackers.  It works really well for that"
1;this has so much flavor with the seasoned dough mix. i've made this for those that do  not have a gluten allergy and have gotten wonderful comments as to how flavorful it is. deefinitely will continue to purchase this!
1;"""I've tried many GF pizza crusts and this is now my favorite because of ease of use and taste. I'm the only GF member in my family so now when the kids want pizza I can whip this up pretty easily on the side. It's not quite as economical since it's not bulk"
1;"""This is the best gluten free pizza mix I've dealt with.  My kids think it tastes great so it's nice that we can actually eat pizza again.  The dough mixes up and rolls out easily.  I also don't have problems with it sticking to the rolling pin or pan like some of the other mixes I've used. It's best to follow the instructions exactly the first time"
1;"""Flavorful bursts of cinnamon and dashes of licorice dance within this delicious tea.<br /><br />This tea is an excellent selection to relax with after a long day or a delectable way to inspire one's self as the sun rises.<br /><br />Drink Tea for Your Health<br /><br />Ingredients: Eleuthero"
1;These are fabulous. Too bad they don't come with tape to secure them directly to my hips :)<br /><br />They arrived quickly and in perfect condition.<br /><br />The other reviewer must be referring to a time when this product was accidentally placed in the pet category. These things happen and I would imagine it should be obvious that they're not pet treats
1;If you've ever had as Bahlsen Hit cookies (normally a plain cookie with chocolate filling) you'll know these have to be good.  A creamy center that can easily be eaten separatly by nibbling off the cookie top and bottom.  A dry cookie that isn't too sweet but full of flavor.<br /><br />Great for a mid-day snack.  I always have a roll in my desk draw at work.<br /><br />Very Very Tasty!
1;"""I got in on the cookies a few weeks ago from Bahlsen that had the chocolate filling. They are wonderful cookies and at less than $1 a pack you cannot go wrong. These things were made for a quick coffee or milk dunk. Don't let them soak as the light cookie will fall apart"
1;"""I LOVE this cookie.  I have been eating these since I was a little baby!  I was so sad when they were hard to find in the U.S. for a few years... but VERY excited when I saw them for sale at a grocery store a week ago!!!  As for it being  bad  for you - honestly"
1;"""I buy a case of these or the cocoa variety whenever Amazon features them on the Friday Sale -- generally about six dollars less than the listed $22.00.  The 5 ounce packages are paper reinforced cylinders"
1;"""At the sale price you should buy two cases.  Hits are the best cookies.  I've been buying them for years.  One reviewer compared them to Oreos.  DON'T.  There is no comparison.  The biscuit is mild chocolate and the cream is not a thick tasteless glob"
1;These are very good cookies I enjoyed eating them so much that I gave some to my daughter and her boyfriend and they liked them.The chocolate filling provides just enough sweetness the cookies are not super sweet themselves.I know the amount of saturated fat in these is not healthy but the cookies are very tasty.The price made them hard to resist once you eat one its hard to stop.Would order again.
1;A favorite around here! With both kids and adults -- especially excellent as someone else mentioned if you eat them from the fridge -- Yum! The vanilla cookie/cracker with creme de cocoa filling are also excellent!
1;"""These cookies aren't too sweet/sugary on the taste buds. So you can give it to your kids (or yourself) and not worry about them getting hyper.<br /><br />The thing about buying food over Amazon is that the expiration date is only like 2 months away. Plan to split the food and costs with someone"
1;I have a sweet tooth but do not like the calories.  I have eaten these products and they satisfy my sweet cravings without the major sugar rush or fat content of most U.S. products.  I prefer changing between the vanilla creme center and chocolate cookie and the chocolate creme center with the vanilla cookie.
1;I am very impressed with this product (and the company that creates it). The packaging is gorgeous - nice enough to give as a gift as is. And the dark chocolate covered orange peels are the best I have ever tasted. The dark chocolate is rich and flavorful. The candied orange peels on the inside are the perfect balance of sweet and tart. And they're easy to bite into - not hard like some others I've tried.<br /><br />Yes these are pricy but they are truly gourmet. And since the package includes a full pound I believe that justifies the price.<br /><br />I ordered this during the winter so I was not concerned about melting.
1;"""Walgreens and Rite Aid often sells Kashi cereals of this size @ 2 (TWO) for  only $5.00.  And never more than $5.00 for one box.<br />Why would anyone want to pay over $6.00 a box just to have it delivered is beyond me and have to buy 6 boxes at once at that to get this  savings . Go to the store"
1;I have been eating this for a couple of years now and it is yet another terrific product from Kashi.  Very yummy wheat cereal that is a touch sweet and has great natural cinnamon flavor.  I eat it and I am full for hours and hours just like most Kashi cereals.
1;I must say me and my kids enjoyed this candy alot. We have never tasted anything like it before. My older friend ( in her 70's ) remembers eating it as a kid. I had to share it with her. She enjoyed it and she is picky. I must admit I ate most of it. Great purchase.
1;"""My dog loves these  treats  that are good for him.  He has lots of stomach issues.  I love Jake's Dog House.  They are very good with following up with you.  I contacted them since I had no received my package by the date I was supposed to.  They were quick to respond telling me it had been rerouted by accident and quickly got it sent to me.  I highly recommend this product and company!"""
1;"""I can't say I'm a fish lover because of some fish taste too fishy and as crazy as this sounds I love the taste of the Sesame Seaweed Snacks (not the Wasabi one) .<br />Give it try before you thumb you nose at these. Seaweed is said to be loaded with numerous vitamins and minerals .<br />Try it with dill dip cream like the kind you put on crackers and see how great they taste. I go through the whole package without the guilt of pigging out on calories and carbohydrates overload.<br />Yes"
1;"""This is a great spice for several things.  I cook a few tablespoons in with a pan of rice for very tasty rice.  It is also good either baked into bread or baked on top of bread like you might do with sesame seeds.  I'm sure there are a bunch of other great uses for it as well"
1;"""This is about the same price you'd pay per can at the grocery store with Amazon's 99 cent shipping promotion. I love this clam chowder. It's comfort food for me and each time I open a can it's the same soup again and again"
1;"""Tippy is a 6 pound toy poodle that my son rescued.  She is so adorable and so picky! She loves treats but goes extra CRAZY over these.  She sees one and goes nuts!  (She spins around in circles and jumps about 2 feet in the air to give you a high-five. -- I wish I could do that.)<br /><br />Of course"
1;"""These large dentastix have been great for our 90 pound golden retriever/ collie mix.  He loves the taste and his teeth are being protected at the same time.  I give him one every morning and it has made a noticeable difference on the tartar build up.  Comparing this brand to more expensive brands (like greenies)"
1;"""My baby had a horrible reaction to Similac.  He could not suck and breathe at the same time.  He made terrible noises while trying to suck and you had to take the bottle out of his mouth every 15 seconds so he would not choke.<br /><br />We took him to a  specialist  at Miami Children's Hospital.  The doctor said that it was NOT THE FORMULA.  He put my baby through some test where the baby was screaming terribly.  Then he wanted us to come back so he could stick a camera down his esophagus. We never went back. We changed his formula to Baby's Only and the problem immediately went away on the first bottle!<br /><br />I firmly believe that the baby would have been quickly given a feeding tube.  That's how bad he was on the Similac! By the way"
1;I HAVE USED THE ULTRA CUBES FOR CHICKEN BROTH BEFORE. THIS WAS MY FIRST TRY WITH VEGETABLE BROTH.  I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE TASTE. IT DISSOLVED  EASILY WITHOUT ANY GRIT. INDIVIDUALLY FOILED WRAPPED AND VERY EASY TO STORE. COMES IN FLAT BOXES.  I AM PLEASE WITH MY PURCHASE OF THIS PRODUCT.
1;I have used The Vegg for a variety of recipes.  It is not exactly like eggs but gives that egg flavoring.  You may have to use starch with some of the recipes for a thickening/binding effect.  I have already developed two tofu cheesecake recipes that are pretty wonderful.
1;I have been using this for awhile. I add it to any recipe that calls for eggs. it gives that eggy taste that i love. i have been vegan for 3 months now and the vegg makes it possible cause when i am craving egg i just whip some of this up :D thank you for such a great product. oh and it makes the best french toast ever :D
1;"""I was thrilled when I saw this baking powder at such a great price in the bigger cans. I only use aluminum-free baking powder. It has no bitter taste and is better for you. It's becoming harder for me to find"
1;"""My mom was going to the store and I asked if she could pick up some baking powder for me. She brought home Rumford. I had always used another brand and I was a little disappointed. I hadn't specified so I couldn't be upset. From the very first recipe I used it in until now"
1;I like that this baking powder is aluminum free.  The cost is less than grocery stores price.  This is a reliable product and it is handy to have a back-up when baking in case you run out of baking powder.
1;This product unlike baking powders you buy at your local grocery store contains no aluminum compounds which experts say you should stay away from.  It's a good product that works well and the price is right.
1;"""I went to Rocket Fizz to sample all the brands of ginger beer.  I bought 12 different ginger beers.  I tasted each one and found that only the Regatta brand had that wonderful smooth taste.  It is a drink I can't be without.  I tell everyone about this wonderful product.  Once you taste this"
1;"""Word to the wise before purchasing : your noodles didn't go bad. The slightly fishy smell is normal.<br /><br />If you're expecting to cook a fancy pasta dish with angel hair shirataki noodles and let it replace your normal pasta dishes"
1;This is a true miracle we love it.... We are using it to support our wheat belly diet and are doing great i'm down 43 pounds in 4 month's just took wheat out of my diet....and i love pasta and this fill's that void very very well...
1;"""I can finally have my noodles and eat them too! I love pasta but I hate the stuffed feeling I get after eating it and the high carb content. I BOOUGHT these noodles FROM AMAZON because you can get them for a GREAT PRICE and FREE SHIPPING. I'm really don't understand all the complaints as the noodles were easy to prepare"
1;"""Here's what I've done to incorporate these noodles into a successful weight-loss food:<br /><br />1. Rinse them off in a colander when you open the package--to get rid of the fishy smell.<br />2. Pour boiling water over them.<br />3. Cut them up into short pieces with a knife--otherwise they're really long"
1;Does it get any better when i can eat AS MUCH PASTA AS I WANT!!!! i thought these noodles sounded too good to be true! Well they taste too good to be true! All you need is a good sauce to go with them a voila!! If youre addicted to carbs like me- this will save your life!!! yum!!
1;I'm on the HCG diet and made a great hcg meat spaghetti sauce. It was good but definately needed pasta. I ordered these and put the same sauce on them and it was almost like eating pasta. There is no smell or taste to the noodles so they take on the taste of the sauce or soup you put them in. I definately feel fuller and it stays with you longer (makes not cheating easier). I plan to continue to use these even after the diet so I can continue to enjoy Italian recipes without the calories. I ordered the rice and use those in my chicken spinach soup.
1;These noodles are perfect for stir fry or spaghetti.  I am on a very low calorie diet and these noodles fit the bill without costing me excess carbs and calories.  They take on the flavor of what you are cooking i.e. pasta sauce.  You will love them.
1;"""I tried these noodles even after reading the negative reviews about the fishy smell and I am SO glad I did.  What you need to do is rinse them thoroughly and boil them before you add them to your food.  As long as you do this it will NOT have that fishy smell.  I made some awesome stir frys with lots of veggies and either shrimp or chicken.  I even tricked my hubby and he is NOT into healthy food at all. They are even surprisingly filling.  I love my carbs"
1;"""Miracle Noodles are calorie free noodles that are based on a very traditional Japanese food.  What this company has done is to make them more appealing to people in the west with various different shapes.  I saw them on the Talk with Rocco Dispirito as one of the recipes in his new book Eat This Now! Diet features Miracle Noodles.<br /><br />They take on the flavor of anything you cook them with BUT you must follow the instructions which are to rinse and boil for one minute then dry (this last step being very important)  They are mostly water so for me they work best in soups and casseroles.  Check out their facebook page for tons of recipes from customers.<br /><br />My father eats these since he is diabetic and my mother has lost lots of weight just eating these for lunch everyday.  As with anything"
1;I ordered these and then read all the reviews of the smell and texture and thought omg what did i just order. Cause i got the BIG sampler pack. Once i recieved them i opened the package and the smell is pretty strong fishy smell but not that bad. I cooked them exactly how it said to and they came out perfect. No smell or funny textures. I was worried i wouldnt be able to make them right but its pretty simple. We were doing the HCG diet and it got very boreing eating the same thing everyday and this added so many more options that we could do with the allotted food!
1;"""This is genius!<br /><br />I purchase Angel hair first and after that bought a big box of angel hair and fettuccine! The product is AMAZING! Don't get fooled by all these negative reviews!<br /><br />If you like Asian food"
1;"""Just got these noodles through groupon.  Fantastic.  They're a lot like clear rice noodles.  Easy to prepare after a thorough rinsing.  Absorb all the flavors of the sauce they're in. For the people who are bashing the noodles: 1. Try exercising instead of whining about a food that has 0 (zero)"
1;"""I was going to write a review whether I thought these were good or bad. Of course I was going to hope for good because I just ordered three packages without evening knowing what they really tasted like. I was risking a gamble. I just got the package today and decided I was going to try them today. I had been informed and read the reviews about how the noodles really take on the flavor and that is completely correct. I cooked them in boiling water with soy sauce and garlic salt. Those noodles tasted superbly. I was not disappointed. If anything I was surprised how well they took in the flavor. I was a bit skeptic but I am glad to have been proved wrong. Also"
1;"""My family and I love the taste and texture of this wonderful  miracle noodle . I have used them in several soups and I am excited to cover them with pasta sauce. In soup they have a texture similar to ramen noodles...taste way to good to be as healthy as they are!"""
1;there really isnt a 'taste' to this but it does hold up whatever flavor you add. Its a great filler food to keep you fuller while on a low cal or low carb diet I eat this often but I always pair it with my veggies etc. I could live without it but I choose not to :)
1;"""Bought these as a no carb alternative to noodles.  They are a great replacement when you are really craving noodles.  I have used for spaghetti and other red sauce dishes.<br /><br />They smell a bit weird"
1;If you follow the directions on the bag the smell should not be an issue after cooking. The texture is not unlike some rice noodles I've had at Chinese restaurants. In my opinion they are pretty tasty depending on how you season or sauce them. I will buy more in the future.
1;"""I am amazed at how these noodles taste like whatever you want them to taste like. I like pasta but have never really craved it because it is SO heavy to me. I feel like napping after eating regular pasta and feel SO bloated. These are just what I needed to help me get through my HCG diet. They are so filling"
1;This noodle works the best with my low carb diet. I always have a hard time thinking of what I can eat when I am on my low card diet. I can be satisfied because I am eating noodles and I will be sticking to my low carb diet. The noodles taste great. Easy to cook.
1;"""I gave these noodles a try and although they are not the tastiest they still get the job done.  I am amazed at the nutrition label.  Calories?  Zero.  Total Fat?  None.  Cholestrol?  Absolutely not.  No sugars"
1;"""I have used the noodle in several recipes and truly impressed with the versatility.<br />  I started with stir fry and was satisfied with the taste but found the leftovers fantastic.  The flavor of the sauce soaked into the noodle and wow.<br /><br />  I used them in a chicken Tetrazzini and again they took in the light flavor of the sauce and very satisfying.<br /><br />  The most appreciated (by my sister) was as an extention to spaghetti noodles.  She has been just been classed as Diabetic and a 1/2cup of pasta just does not look right so used the noodle as an extender.  I did soak the noodle in flavored water(powdered garlic"
1;"""Are you a big fan of Hot & Spicy  cup of noodle  products?  I am too and these are the perfect solution to avoid getting an entire day's worth of sodium and about 400 calories from a simple bowl of spicy soup.<br /><br />I take one package of the noodles and rinse them in cold water and put them in boiling water for a minute or so (basically following the directions on the package).  Then I soak it in chicken broth overnight in the fridge.  The following day I dice up some chicken and drain the bowl of the broth until there's the amount of liquid I prefer for my soup.  Add in some texas pete buffalo wing sauce (anything similar will do just fine) and mix it around and you have some delicious"
1;"""Foremost: ~99% soluble fiber is great for you.<br /><br />These noodles will-not get soft. I would not recommend for marinara sauce of any type. These noodles are made for stir fry type dishes. I did not feel they were rubbery at all. Make sure you blanch (toss in boiling water for a few minutes) before eating them.<br /><br />Overall"
1;"""I am currently on a No Carb diet and bought these noodles. I think the important note here is that you MUST rinse them at least 3 times before cooking them and then again after. They are shipped in a liquid filled bag (which doesn't smell too pleasant) and before I prepare them I rinse them at least 3 times and separate them with my hands under running water to make sure I rinsed off all of the liquid. They take a minute to cook and are basically flavorless. They soak up the flavor of whatever they are cooked in so I like to cook them in broth or salty water. After they are cooked"
1;"""This is the year I vowed to lose 100 lbs. I did that and more and still going. I discovered these gems by accident through an ad online that boasted about a zero calorie noodle. I was suspicious. I read and researched it and put in my first order.<br />I rinsed them thoroughly and prepared my first meal with them using tomato sauce and eating them like spagetti. I was HOOKED! I eat these in several meals a week. I usually throw in some veggies"
1;"""I ordered Miracle Noodle to help with my HCG diet. (I am in between my 2nd and 3rd rounds)  I have been able to enjoy a few  pasta  meals now with Miracle Noodle.  Thanks to reading all the detailed reviews I knew what to expect and how best to cook them.  My spaghetti was great and very filling.  I ate it before a very stressful night at a Christmas production dress rehearsal.  I stayed full and had no hunger or blood sugar drops well into the night.  I cooked them just as the package recommended (drain and rinse with cold water then parboil). After that I cooked them with the sauce for 2-3 minutes.  My whole bowl was 70 calories about 3 carbs.  Those calories are from 1/2 sauce and a 1/2 cup mushrooms.<br /><br />The next meal I did the first two steps on the package and then dry cooked them until they  squeaked  (saw that idea in a another review).  Then stir fried them for the last 2-3 minutes with chicken"
1;I am on a severely limited carb diet plus have wheat and gluten allergies but love pasta and really miss it.  These are a dream come true for me.  Now I can have pasta dishes and not go off my diet or trigger allergies.  I made phad thai with them and it was as good as using a traditional noodle.  I will be making repeat orders for sure.
1;I think this Miracle Noodles brand smells less than others I've tried but your still have to really rinse them with cold water before cooking to get that fishy smell out. Throwing in some sauces and flavorings when you cook them helps too as they'll absorb the good flavors and the fishy smell will be gone. I think these noodles are a very healthy food and can be eaten even if you're not dieting. Once you prepare them correctly you'll find they work just as well as regular pasta noodles in recipes.
1;"""I've switched to a low carb lifestyle and one of the most challenging things to eat is things that I would traditionally eat with rice or pasta... like mac and cheese or thai curry. For years I've been getting konnyaku noodles from the Asian grocer but I was happy when I found these as a I have a little more faith in their actual contents. The trick to shirataki/konnyaku is to let them sit in a flavor rich sauce so they absorb the flavor. Don't prepare them plain and expect them to taste good"
1;I reluctantly bought these noodles after ready many reviews...some good and some really bad. I'm SO glad I tried them. They definitely do have a fishy smell when you open the package but I wasn't shocked as I had read that. Once rinsed they didn't smell at all. I followed the package directions exactly...blanch in boiling water for one minute then dry on a paper towel and toss into your dish. I added them to a stir fry and they tasted awesome. I let them sit in the soy sauce marinade for about 10 minutes before adding them. They totally soaked up the flavor of the sauce. They tasted like rice noodles would. Not sure I would try them in a traditional pasta dish but for Asian or Chinese style dishes I think they are great. Since they are filling and have no calories they are definitely magic in my book!!
1;I received these today and can say anyone whining about the smell is a baby the smell isn't that bad even before washing them. They have absolutely NO TASTE which is great because they can go with anything. I tried them plain and no taste at all then I reheated some chili I made for dinner last night and it came out great mixed in. I would recommend that you start out with a smaller or thinner product when first trying them. Just realized I did order the Angel hair but received fettuccini but will be keeping them anyway since I already ate some. They do have a weird texture but with anything new it will take some getting used to & it's not so weird you can't eat it. I saw others claiming it was like jello but it's more like a noodle not cooked completely.
1;"""I have to admit that I was a little apprehensive about trying these because of a couple of the reviews here. One person even said they were disgusting and she had to throw them away.<br /><br />But I was pleasantly surprised to find that IMO these are excellent"
1;These are the classic Slo Poke creamy caramel candy I grew up with. very creamy van nilla tasting 24 bars to a box and I have a months worth to enjoy.  These are not available locally and never in large amounts.  These are a good size not the bite size that are  just that a bite.  You do have to eat them slowly .
1;This candy is absolutely wonderful. Just like I remember from when I was a kid. I shared these at the office and people who had never had them before went crazy over how good they are. It is a soft chewy buttery caramel that is full of flavor. The item was shipped quickly and the candy was fresh
1;"""I love this stuff!!  I am a bodybuilder and eat a TON of tuna and salmon and like to keep packets in my desk drawer and gym bag for quick snacks.  I am so excited to have descovered this stuff here on Amazon.com for two reasons.  #1- because it is CHEAP!  Way cheaper than in the store.  #2- because it ROCKS!  It tastes awesome!  I'd eat this even if I wasn't bodybuilding.  It is a yummy"
1;This salmon has a very nice Mediterranean flavor without being too spicy.  The package size is great and convenient to make 1-2 sandwiches out of each bag or take it to go and eat it for lunch with bread or some dish.  The taste is very good--as if it is freshly prepared salmon.
1;I have been buying this from the local market for months. They recently clearanced it -- I am so happy to find a convenient source! I like to heat Uncle Ben's brown rice single serving and add the salmon pouch. It makes a great dinner for one.
1;"""I was ordering Native Forest Coconut Milk from Amazon quite frequently. It was the most delectable coconut milk I could find anywhere. The five star reviews were spot on. Loved it!<br /><br />Then all the sudden I started receiving a completely different product in a can with the same label. It seemed like very"
1;"""I have used 10/12 cans and I love this coconut milk!  I haven't received any dented cans and they have all had the best consistency and taste compared to any other coconut milk I have had.  It makes amazing ice cream and goes well whipped and in my tea"
1;"""I have read a lot of mixed reviews and was hesitant to purchase this item. I have now ordered 2 cases over the course of 4 months and both were high quality delicious coconut milk. It does seperate (which is normal) so just give the can a good shake before you open it. No dented cans either"
1;"""This is the best coconut milk I have ever tasted.  It reminds me of the dairy form of half and half but the texture and taste is silky and light.  My can does state  Product of Thailand .  I purchased at a retail store while traveling.  I'm online looking to purchase.  I'm really surprised it was not rated 5 stars by others."""
1;I've enjoyed this in smoothies and curries.  Sometimes I like to skim the thick portion off to eat plain.  It is thicker in cool weather - so I may stick a can in the fridge during the summer before using it.
1;"""These are SO good!  Whenever I come across them in Whole Foods I grab at least 2 packs!  I have yet to have a rancid nut in all the bags I've ever had.  There is nothing worse than an old nut!... but again"
1;"""I love Next Organic Dark Chocolate Nutes! They are not overly sweet or too hard to chew. The dark chocolate coating is tasty.<br /><br />Brazil nuts are nutritious. My physician says they are a good source of selenium.<br /><br />I wish these were less expensive"
1;This is great caramel sauce it's so rich tasting you love it!! If you like coffee drinks with caramel sauce this is the one to get! I finally made my favorite iced caramel macchiato drink to perfection. Plus I got free shipping by buying two! ENJOY !
1;Wow!!  I've been trying to find a good caramel sauce for some time and this one fits the bill exactly. We make our own home-made ice cream and I've been wanting to try a caramel ice cream.  We brought some vanilla bean ice cream to a get-together and enough of the sauce for everyone to try.  They all loved it and I had to promise to bring caramel ice cream next time.  tastes great with perfect texture.
1;"""My local grocery store has stopped stocking Crown Prince canned clams and I'm forced to buy them online instead. I've opened cans side by side with Snow's and have been shocked that the Crown Prince cans contain more than twice as much clam meat"
1;"""I love Chai and Zhena's is the BEST!  I happened upon Zhena's coconut chai in my local grocery store but they only stocked it for a short time so I was pleased to find it here!  Add a splash of vanilla almond milk to this and you'll be in heaven!  Want something even more yummy?  Use a little whipper to froth it up and it's better than desert!  Oh"
1;"""after my daughter was born she was put on the similac advantage. she did okay for a week and then had violent gas pains. we swithed to the lactose free of the same brand and she was ok for a week and then the same problem again. then we switched to similac isomil soy and she was better but was getting horribly constipated. finally"
1;"""Just like I remember them 8 years ago.  I used to buy these for about the same price at my local supermarket until they disappeared 4-5 years ago.  I was so happy when I saw these on Amazon!  They are delicious and taste better than other apple chips in my opinion.  However"
1;"""We first came across this olive oil at our local IGA a few years back.  Then we moved 600 miles and could not find it anywhere.<br /><br />It is the most incredible oil - there is NOTHING that compares with it. We use it for everything from marinating to salad dressing - any place an oil is required and it is fabulous.<br /><br />We ran out last week"
1;Was in Napa Valley at the Dean & Deluca store.  Talking with a couple of chefs I observed what oil they were purchasing.  Frantoia  was their choice.  I sent bottles around the country for holiday gifts and everyone loved it.  Going to do the same this year.
1;Great product.  If you like spicy foods then this is the popcorn for your movie watching at home.  I took several of these into work and got raves over how spicy it is.  I have a few co-workers that have ordered their own.
1;I would say the spicy level of this popcorn is in line if not MORE spicey than their burning nuts.  A handful of these or just a slow picking of the kernals on this will quickly build a small fire in your mouth.<br /><br />The big warning I have is how they smell in the microwave.  it will smell up your microwave AND your kitchen!!
1;Do you like to munch on some popcorn while watching a movie at home?  Do you like serious heat in your food (i.e. Dave's insanity sauce)?  Then you'll love this spicy popcorn.<br /><br />Just be sure to share this with other people who can handle the heat.  It'd certainly be a waste to toss half a bag of this popcorn.
1;"""This superb tea is a must for tea lovers!  I first tried the English Breakfast and Earl Grey when I was visiting a friend in London a couple of years ago.  The teas are full of flavor and truly a British style tea.  And yes"
1;"""This is the best barley flour I ever bought.  Delievery was swift and the product was fresh.<br />I use 2 tbspoons with one cup of milk to make a daily cup of porride sweatenned with honey.  A great recipe for a healty happy heart"
1;Doggie biscuits are made with Barley flour.  I was finding it difficult to find.  This site has it in quantity and at a great price.  The bonus is that I can us this flour for my own needs as well as those of my pup.  He does love his homemade biscuits!
1;Tastes great!  I love the fact that Hershey's uses erythritol and not maltitol like all other sugar free products use. No harmful side effects associated with sugar alcohol.  Tastes great for being sugar free!
1;"""I discovered sugar free Hershey's syrup a few months ago and have since become addicted to it.  It's great on low-carb ice cream and can be added to silk or regular milk to make low sugar chocolate milk or hot chocolate.  I have also tried adding it to Cool Whip for a  chocolate mousse .  I think it tastes very similar to the regular Hershey's syrup and wouldn't know the difference if no one said anything."""
1;This item is hard to find in local stores and is good for a sweet snack for a diabetic. From my experience this product does not spick my blood suger as bad as many items and gives me something sweet to curb my cravings.
1;"""The Hershey's Sugar-Free Chocolate Syrup *was* a wonderful product. I emphasise  was  because I just found out that the aforementioned product has apparently been pulled from the local shelves.<br /><br />I sincerely hope this is a temporary situation... This product was great for people that need to restrict sugars and/or carbohydrates."""
1;"""Of all the tea's I have experimented with this is my absolute favorite! In an attempt to cut down on some of my caffine consumption I began trying different herbal tea's and fell in love with Rooibo's which I now drink everday instead of good old lipton's.<br />Pride of Africa is a combination of rooibo's and honeybush tea"
1;"""I have small dogs (Maltese) and these cookies are just the right size for tiny mouths.  I love that they are made in AMERICA and from quality ingredients. No worries about finding out that there is some terrible ingredient in them that will make my dogs sick or be fatal like some of the treats that come from CHINA.  I have these on the monthly subscription plan"
1;I love these biscottis. They are 15 calories each and taste wonderful. Because there are so few calories these falls under a diet product which means they aren't cheap. However I got them here for about 30% less than the other vendor I used online.
1;"""These cookies were deliciousness personified-and healthy besides! They taste even better than girl scout traditional thin mints. They are also better and better for you than the Keebler Grasshopper cookies. I personally like them best when kept in the freezer. I highly recommend"
1;These taste exactly like the Girl Scout Thin Mint Cookies!!  And to find an organic version without compromising taste is heaven!!<br /><br />Hopefully up next for BTN is.....an organic version of Samoas? :0)
1;"""These cookies are so good.  Maybe not great for my waist line (everything in moderation right).  These taste much better than the GS thin mints.  The coating is fudgy and thicker than the GS version.  I love buying them by the case here.  So much cheaper than my local store.  Hey they taste great and they are all natural.  I do wish they were organic...but"
1;I was very happy with both the caviar and the company. The shipment arrived next day well packaged and with wonderfully reusable freezer packs. The caviar was fresh and extremely tasty. I would certainly order from them again.
1;My grandson is thriving on this formula he was having a lot of difficulty with regular formula and this sensitive one does the trick he has gained inches and pounds and is happy and laughing we think anyone with a fussy baby should try it
1;It does what it is supposed to. After switching to Similac Sensitive from the regular Similac Avanced the lactose-sensitivity symptoms our son was having disappeared. He is now almost 11 months old and we have been using this formula in the last 8 months or so without problems.
1;"""I love this formula. Our son has always been very gassy and at first I tried removing dairy + acidic food from my diet (for up to 8 weeks) but it didn't seem to help much. So we decided to supplement the breast milk with the enfamil gentlease: it did help some but still gassy and sleepying poorly which reflected in a very fussy baby during the day. 3 days ago we switched to the similac sensitive and for the past 3 nigths he slept consistently for 6 hours"
1;"""Similac Sensitive for fussy and gassy babies is amazing. Our pumpkin loves it! I was afraid to try formula because our baby is breastfeed and had trouble with gassiness from milk products I ate or drank. This was the perfect solution if you are going to try formula for the first time. We haven't had any problems for 3 weeks now. No fussiness"
1;"""I have stricly formula fed my daughter since day one. We started out with Similac Advance in the hospital and did great with that for the first 5 weeks. My daughter started getting really fussy during feedings and having trouble with painful gas and some spit up. Similac had sent us a nice package which included a sample of the sensitive powder so we thought we would give it a try. We noticed a difference immedietly. What we also noticed was how foamy the powder was compared to the advance. We tried the powder for about 10 days and noticed our baby seemed to be getting uncomfortable again when using the powder. I had purchased some of the 8oz ready to feeds and had used them a few times and she seemed to digest it better. My daughter is used to drinking formula at room temperature"
1;We started this formula when our now 6 month old was about a week old. The regular formula caused her to spit up and once we switched it stopped. We use the ready to feed and with the subscribe and save the price is less than Wal-Mart or Target and it just shows up which is handy.
1;"""There have been some harsh reviews about the ingredients in the liquid Similac Sensitive.  It is true that milk based formula should be first choice as it is closest to mother's milk.  When milk can't be used due to a lactose intolerance"
1;Make sure you are ordering from Amazon and not the seller on the main page! With the Subcribe & Save you will pay the same as in the stores right now! And free delivery right to your door - can't beat it!
1;Great purchase! We have a 13 week old labradoodle puppy and this can keep him busy and entertain for a good amount of time. He loves laying ont he floor and chewing it and it's a great thing to use so they stop chewing furniture and other things.
1;This was exactly what I was looking for after being unable to locate it anywhere in the stores.  I fill it with a little bit of peanut butter every morning before I leave for work.  My dogs love it and it keeps them busy.
1;"""We use them for our dogs' mouthing and teething.  It works.  They love it and thus do not touch furnitures and others they are not supposed to.  Also we put some meat or peanut butter into the bone when they are bored.  They love it"
1;Solid Gold Hundenflocken was recommended to me for my miniture Yorkie.  She has had pancreatitis several times and I didn't know what was causing it.  Someone suggested it may be all the preservatives in the regular dog foods.  She has been on Solid Gold Hundenflocken for 4 years now and has not had any more trouble with pancreatitis.  This is a great product!
1;Been using hunden flocken for quite some time. Fine product. Company never disappointed me in terms of quality of product. Finally it should be obvious from the shipping weight that this is the 4lb bag. This size is more convenient for us.
1;I have a hard time finding food my cat likes and that won't make her alergies worse.  This one really seems like it hits on all counts.  It also comes in a pretty large bag so I don't have to order it as often.
1;"""I have a cat with allergies and my girlfriend was buying the $50+ per bag food at the vets. Super expensive and a 40 minute round trip. She was hesitant to give this a try so I told her I would buy it.... Well the cats love it"
1;I have two indoor/outdoor cats and they really like this stuff.  They are not too picky but I like to feed them grain free food and this is great product that I feel I can trust.<br /><br />My dog eats the same brand so I figured why not?  It is not as expensive as a lot of other grain free food out there and it lasts for at least a month for the two cats I have.
1;My whole family loves these.  The small bags go great in the car and in the diaper bag.  My only issue is that there are seeds so watch out.... I open the bags then make sure all are okay before giving the bag to my kids.
1;"""These are REAL ripe olives.....not the black-colored ones you see in grocery stores.  I first tried these at Graber House in Southern California and fell in love with them.  These are the best olives you can buy.  Matter of fact"
1;"""I cure my own olives - I only wish I could learn to do this good a job- Grabers are hard to find - they are the best!<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P8HPCI >Graber Olives Size 14 7.5 oz. Can</a>"""
1;"""Graber olives are simply the best. They are also expensive and have limited availability . . . Hard to find. Are they worth the price and bother? You have to judge that for yourself. I think so. They are tree ripened and have a flavor that brings new sensations of the Earth"
1;"""I haven't had these since I left CA and am so excited that they are available on-line. They are sooooo good and very addicting. Will definitely order more. Everyone should have these in their pantry. You'll even get your friends addicted to them"
1;These olives are the best quality olives (they resemble a black olive in taste - a really good black olive).  Not to salty like greek or green olives.  Pleasent flavor and compliments cheese and crackers or even a deli tray.  My friends loved these (big hit).

1;"""Perfect high protein snack and squeeze packs make it portable for purse or lunch box. Add Justin's nut butter to an apple or banana and enjoy. This product needs to be  limbered up  by squeezing the packs a few times before opening as indicated on the directions. It makes a big difference in the consistency of the butter."""
1;"""I own a small bulk/natural food store and my customers were asking for almond butter. I didn't want to start out by carrying large jars of nut butters if I wasn't sure they would sell so I purchased Justin's squeeze packets just to give them a try. Each packet"
1;I am a huge nut butter fan and i have been actively trying new kinds. Almond butter has become my favorite. I have been buying regular jars but i find myself going through it too quickly. I thought that prepackaged protions would be a better option. These are exactly what i needed. It is the right amount for a pb and j or should i say ab and j. They are convenient and delicious. I highly recommend.
1;Prior to purchasing this product I had never tried any Justin's Nut Butters nor had I ever tried almond butter before.  I am very glad I tried this product.  I especially like the individual packets.  This makes for easy portion control and is convenient for on the go snacking/meals.  I will be buying this brand again.
1;I had my first Justin's awhile back and I have been hooked ever since! The squeeze packets are so handy and portable. I always have one or two or one hundred in my purse for those emergency hunger bites! Try Justin's on a rice cake - you won't regret it!
1;Justin's almond butter is so fantastic it not only tastes amazing they use quality ingredients and I love the single serving packets. These are perfect for me to take to school so that I can put on my sandwiches or just eat straight out of the packets with crackers! You won't regret buying these!
1;Hi! I'm pleased to have purchased Kikkoman Instant Shiro Miso. This soup is very easy to prepare. Simply add hot water and stir. Outer envelope contains 3 individual serving packets. Salt content might be on the high side for some users. Best to check product details. The soup does not taste salty. I would buy this miso soup again.
1;"""I have reordered this product before in 240 count. I was waiting for my appointment at Yale New Haven Hospital and viewing the hospital closed circuit TV which was explaining health tips. The topic changed to the benefits of green tea and it mentioned it's anti oxidant properties and the fact that it helps reduce belly fat!!. I do not have a real problem in this area as I am 5' 10 1/2  tall and weighed 209 lbs. After surgery I had to watch my diet and with the help of Stash Green Tea consumed cold from a 32 once thermos at least three times weekly I have lost 17 lbs and inches from my belly area. TIP"
1;"""I bought this tea for my husband because he loves tea...and I tried some too and I have to say that I love this tea.  It tastes great and is smooth and in my opinion this tea is very good quality it has a slightly sweet flavor which I find very pleasing and it comes with 120 tea bags.. I'm really glad that I bought the Stash green tea brand.  I highly recommend it.  Also"
1;Green tea can be very bitter especially if you brew it too long. This tea brews quickly and has a very pure taste and delicate aroma. I like drinking each cup with a packet of stevia. It seems to sweeten it just enough without masking the subtle silky flavors. This tea is made of rare white tea and green tea. White tea actually has more antioxidants than green tea and has less caffeine. So this particluar tea is very healthy. However you will probably drink it often because it tastes so good.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
1;"""I love Jasmine tea! More than anyone trust me. I got my first shipment of six boxes yesterday and have signed up for delivery every two months. The box it came in said  Stash  on the side. I'm assuming this tea came directly from the company. I should think it did by how cheap it is! At the grocery stores near me this tea is $3 a box on sell. This is a great deal!<br /><br />Stash is by far the best company for jasmine tea. I love this stuff! The only thing I would say to a new customer is don't reuse tea bags. Other than that"
1;I drink green tea because its healthy for you especially green tea. Ide say this tea with sugar tastes very very good its one of my drop the soda substitute since its so great! I recommend this tea to buy over some of the more nastier tea's out there but Great Product overall!
1;I love to try new teas. I especially love jasmine teas. This tea by Stash is the best jasmine/green tea I have ever had. The fragrance is so sweet that it is a feast for the taste buds & the nose! I highly recommend it. Very soothing & perfect with a drizzle of honey.
1;"""I LOVE Stash Premium Moroccan Mint Green Tea. They use quality ingredients and the flavors are very well balanced - nothing tastes too strong. I have also found that this tea is particularly tolerant to over-brewing. "
1;This is a good green tea. It is balanced and doesn't have that often grassy taste that green teas tend to have. I would assume that is due to the fact that it is a mix with white tea also. Definitely better than most other green teas !
1;"""I can't go a day without having at least one cup of this tea. It's so fragrant and delicious. Just the right balance of green tea and jasmine. Very smooth. I disagree about the caffeine kick noted by another commenter. Maybe I'm immune to the caffeine"
1;"""I absolutely LOVE this tea.  I am a huge iced tea drinker (more than a quart a day).  I have tried lots of different brands over the years and gradually gotten into lighter and lighter tasting teas.  For many years my tea of choice was darjeeling"
1;The tea tastes great and the price is right.  It has a delightful smell<br />when the envelope is opened and when the tea is brewed.  Green tea has<br />health benefits but the green chai is much more fun to drink than most<br />green teas.
1;"""I used to drive to an out of the way grocery store for Stash Moroccan Mint.  When they stopped carrying it I  was so upset!  It did a hard core internet search and finally found out I could order from Amazon in bulk.  Yay! I drink green tea for the health benefits"
1;I use Stash Premium Green Chai tea bags to impart the chai flavor and aroma to my base brewings of loose green and white teas.  This is better than any loose chai blend I've come across in that it's the right amount of each ingredient.  I ordered 2 so I have 240 tea bags for about $30.  Will last me a year or more while I continue to try out loose blends.
1;I drink this tea almost everyday with a bit of lemon. It never fails to satisfy. I used to drink straight green tea but the grass-clipping flavor eventually began to nauseate me.  I'm glad to have found this tasty alternative.
1;"""This is the only way to get the benefits from Green Tea. The blend of spices is so good. I like it iced with Truvia. Easy to drink and refreshing. A great tea to take on the go. Can't say enough. I found it at my local Albertson's Grocery"
1;My wife and I enjoy a pot of Green Chai Tea each morning.  It has a great flavor.  It is a little hard to find in grocery stores at the quantity that we like.  Hint... set it up as a subscription and you will pay less than most grocery stores and you will have it delivered to your door.
1;"""I am not a very big fan of green tea. I have always found the flavor to be a bit strong. I have had real Moroccan mint tea and found that to be a bit strong as well (in the mint direction). This tea was the perfect mild blend of both for me. And because it is all natural (no artificial or  natural  flavorings) I have been able to drink it every other day on my detox.<br /><br />Please Note: I did not purchase through Amazon. I purchased a box at Target. I would recommend trying it before investing in 6 boxes. I do plan to order this offer thru Amazon once my current box is depleted."""
1;"""I'm trying to drink more green tea because it is so good for you. I'm trying all the Stash green teas one after the other. This one is a favorite as it had a strong Pomegranate and Raspberry flavor I love. By mixing these flavors in with green tea it makes green tea less bitter. The ingredients in this tea include: green tea"
1;I drink at least two cups of tea a day and have tried hundreds of types.  After years of drinking black I have switched to green and white and now I would not go back.  The white is just much cleaner and does not give you an aftertaste.  The green I like to drink after dinner or a meal.  This gives me two of the teas I love in one package.  Now if my gf would stop drinking all of it I would be even more happier :)
1;"""I drink this tea every morning and have it on automatic order for a box of six packages every month.  I do find that I have to steep it just a little longer in order to get the pretty redish pomegranate color and flavor to come through. A friend calls it fruit juice.  I wouldn't go that far"
1;"""I've been drinking this Stash jasmine blossom green tea for the past 5 years because it's loaded with an unexpected kick of caffeine.  It's a good afternoon energy boost if you're not into coffee past 12PM"
1;"""I really like this tea.  I tried all the stash Fushion ones and liked this one best.  To get the full flavor you have to steep it for a long time. This tea also makes a great ice tea.  I make it like regular and then put it in the fridge when it cools down. You can use 2 tea bags in a standard tea pot and it makes a great strength of tea.  The listing says only 5 left"
1;"""I like this better than the Bigelow that I was drinking before and the price is really good.  This is actually the first tea of any kind that I've been able to drink without adding artificial sweetener or honey.  It has a nice subtle flavor and"
1;I love having these around for a quick snack. They are extremely low on calories and have a high fiber content. Having a high fiber content usually leads to feeling full quicker- so that you don't go overboard. The ranch flavor is the best among all of them.
1;"""This and Good Sense Milk Chocolate Crunch are the tastiest of tasty treats!!! 100 times better than chips and sneak a bag of these into a movie theater and you don't need popcorn or candy you got all your crunchy"
1;I agonized over all the purchase options. Finally I decided on this one and could not be more pleased. It's perfect. It has a tight secure lid and it looks nice on the table (if having company). I love it.
1;"""This is my new favorite flavor in The Simply Bar! The peanut butter is very subtle but makes for a nice balance between the PB and Cocoa flavors.  I find it hard to control myself and only eat one of these"
1;The simply bar is simply fantastic :) I love that it is vegan and is high in protein which is helpful for me because I need to find alternative protein sources. They also provide amazing flavors. My favorite is the peanut butter one.
1;These bars are great! Great tasting and with quality wholesome ingredients. The company is great and has outstanding customer service and stand by their product 110% I highly recommend these bars in any flavor.
1;is simply delicious and healthful. They are not packed with preservatives or other things with names that are difficult to pronounce. I have tried Chocolate Peanut butter and looking forward to trying all the flavors.
1;I have tried so many protein bars and most of them taste terrible and/or give me digestive upset. I was looking for a protein bar that was gluten and dairy free and found The Simply Bar. I was excited to receive my box of chocolate peanut butter and it did not disappoint! I love the light and crispy texture and it satisfies my chocolate cravings. This bar is great for a snack or quick breakfast on the go. I also love it because it's low in carbs and sugar. They fit perfectly with my low carb lifestyle. I would definitely recommend these.
1;I had been unhappy with the expensive sundried tomatoes in the market. I took a chance with this product.  They are delicious!!!  So easy to store. And a great source of the antioxidant lycopene!!  I will order them again. VERY happy w/ quality and price.
1;"""These were very nice. I saw other reviews about the flavor being off. I was very happy with the flavor. There are two types of sundried tomatoes. Dried and smoked. These are dried. This gives a medium color and flavor. for those who want the dark or almost black color and a strong flavor. Use the smoked kind. I found these to be very nice.<br /> I was cooking a Sundried Tomatoe Chicken (breast meat chuncks)"
1;I love this tea and have shared it with many of my friends and they all love it.<br />Some say that they are going to order it.  A friend of mine once gave it to me<br />and I tell everyone the only way to get it is order it.  I hope my sharing it will<br />get them to place an order with you.
1;"""I have been a health food aficionado for 38 years and have never tasted such delicious roasted soy nuts. All of the flavors are fabulous. I am especially pleased that the soy nuts are organic which makes them safe with additional health benefits. In today's world so much of our food is GMO whether we know it or not. I like supporting a company like Truson Organics that insists on naturalness and quality. Thank you Truson!<br />Deborah Stelfox<br />Snohomish"
1;About the only time I eat something like this is when I haven't allowed enough time for a proper breakfast before dashing out the door. These bars are tasty and filling without being overly sweet as some such products are. Yummy.
1;"""I bought 2 12 packs of this for my granfather whom used to be able to buy it on post before they stopped carrying it. The shipping was fast and arrived in a timely manner. The bottles where all in good condition and tasted great"
1;I love Kashi products.  I eat one of these every day.  The only complaint I have is with Amazon's price of this product and food products in general.  You can get this at local stores (you know the Red and the Blue one) for less than 3 dollars a box.
1;I love these cereal bars!  They are similar to Nutri-Grain but better.  These do not contain high-fructose corn syrup.  I paid $15.20 for the 6-pack with Subscribe & Save discount.  That's $2.53 per box which is cheaper than I can buy them on sale at the local grocery store.  Excellent value.
1;"""I love the strawberry flavor of these.  I bought these with the Subscribe & Save discount and got them for a very reasonable price - $2.53 p/box.  The expiration date for all 6 boxes isn't until Sept 2012.  I can guarantee all of the cereal bars will be eaten way before then!  I had been buying the Nutragrain bars for our house but like a lot of parents"
1;I love how these bars are so delicious and can be a quick breakfast or light snack. I am glad that Kashi has NO high frutose corn syrup in their products! It is hard to find healthy foods and snacks without corn syrup in it! I can't wait to try the other flavors offered.
1;SHAN spices are sold all over the country from 84c to 99c per pack at your local indian and Pakistani grocery stores.<br />This guy is just rip off and no justification for the over charge. Amazon should be aware of it. As Amazon is a good place to shop and I<br />do my shopping at Amazon and find prices very resonable.
1;"""I can't say if it gives sustained energy as I just had my first pack.  I will say they were crisp and tasted great!  I'm always looking for portable energy food that is NOT low calorie.  These are about 230 calories per pack and since I take snacks like this hiking/backpacking"
1;I LOVE THESE BELVITA BREAKFAST BISCUITS ALTHOUGH I WOULD CONSIDER THEM MORE OF<br />A COOKIE. I HAVE ONLY TRIED THE GOLDEN OAT AND THEY ARE VERY GOOD.  I RATED THEM A FIVE STAR ON QUALITY AND TASTE.<br />ONE THING THAT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT AMAZON IMPROVE ON IS A LITTLE MORE CAUTION IN SHIPPING<br />AS I HAVE RECEIVED SOME THAT WERE HAD SOME BROKEN PIECES.
1;I purchased these several weeks ago and put them at my desk at work for breaksfast on the go.  I've been putting off trying them because I wasn't sure if they would taste like cardboard.  Opened a pack today and was pleasantly surprised!  Will definitely be buying some more.  They taste like a yummy version of a graham cracker.
1;"""When this canned dessert arrived I could hardly wait to open it and try it out but I waited till my son was over and we enjoyed it together! I tasted it cold (got on my fingers while pushing it from the can) and found it very tasty and reminded me of pumpkin. It is supposed to be heated and was very easily done in my microwave. We both liked it heated but I still like it better cold. If you like something sweet"
1;"""I have loved these since I was a kid. They are just awesome!!!! I started to buy these locally at one of the oriental stores (locally meaning a half hour drive - lol). Unfortunately The store I buy such products from had been shut down and there was no other local oriental store from which I could buy my favorite foods. Although shipping is a bit costly"
1;"""I just discovered this candy at Walmart and only bought one bag to see how I liked it. I wish I'd bought more!  I love almost any combination of fruit and chocolate and these sweet-but-tart little morsels are a superb example of how delicious that blend can be.  Walmart's price is currently the best by a large margin"
1;"""<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R81L92 >Brookside Dark Chocolate Covered Pomegranates 2lb Bag</a><br />Usually I get good prices on Amazon but this product was purchased for me from Costco and paid $8.00 less than Amazon.  Product is delicious but I could purchase 2 - 2 lb bags for the price of one on Amazon.  Sorry."""
1;It has gotten so bad in our household that we have to hide the bag from ourselves. We never miss a week without having a bag of these treats on hand. It has gotten worse because now we can find the chocholate pomegrantes even at Walgreens! Help! They are shamefully delicious and impossible to avoid.
1;bought these at costco for a few cents less and figure they will either double in price or never be in stock again glad to know they are here on amazon  They ARE addictingly good..the deep dark chocolate flavor is haunting.  I was looking for choc cherries but these will do nicely
1;"""What a delightful little treat. If you are a  I need a little sweet  person and want just a BIT of yummy to pop in your mouth these are totally satisfying because they have a bit of kick. But the true win in a household of athletes is adding them to trail-mix. If it is hot- They will melt and then glob together with all the other items. These are a delightful little add-in to really upgrade the quality of average trail-mix.<br />Also a nice treat for kids to just snack on something little."""
1;"""I actually had to stop buying these because I couldn't stop myself from eating them. Those 2 lb bags were disappearing a lot faster than I would like what with bikini season around the corner. But OH MAN are they good. Seriously"
1;Brookside Dark Chocolate Covered Pomganites Bag are very good. My sons and I enjoy them alot. We happen to be in Sams Club and seen these and bought them there..I am going to buy more of these next time I go there too...There a hit in my household...
1;The package of Brookside's chocolate covered pomegranates were delivered on time and in perfect condition.  My in-laws thoroughly enjoyed the delectable treats and I definitely will place future orders with Amazon.com.  I highly recommend to everyone that they send this delicious dessert to friends and family.
1;Two of my favorite flavors together. The chocolate is smooth and creamy and the center is a tart sweet combo. The only problem is I can't stop eating them until I get to the bottom of the bag and then I have to go buy more.
1;"""My family raved about these pomegranate delights for months. No one in town carried them. <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R81L92 >Brookside Dark Chocolate Covered Pomegranates 2lb Bag</a>. Arrived just in time to prevent a revolution. Tasty with every morsel."""
1;"""I received a bag of these as a gift and was thrilled to discover that they are identical to Trader Joe's Powerberries. I no longer live near a Trader Joe's and had been missing one of my favorite chocolate treats - so if you're a TJ's ex-pat like me"
1;There is only one thing negative that I can say about these wonderful little morsels ... I can NOT stop eating them!! The combination of the sweet/tart flavors are wonderful and I find them simply addicting! They are my new favorite candy by far!
1;Received a bag of these for Christmas. (Thanks Neva!)  Getting close to the bottom of the bag now...so I looked on Amazon to order some more very soon.  These candies are very good dark sweet chocolate with a center of tartness--a jell or gumdrop type center made of the pomegranate juice and other high quality ingredients.  The corn syrup content seems minor (I have an aversion to any noticeable corn syrup taste). These Canadian made candies are a very pleasant surprise.  I will probably be ordering some for gifts next Christmas!
1;Yum yum. Just the most perfect chocolate wrapped around a deliciously slightly tart centre. Absolutely worth the cost and I just wish I could give more than 5 stars ! These were delivered to the other side of the planet (almost) and arrived perfectly safely with absolutely no deterioration at all from being frozen at high altitudes in the plane on the way over. I will definitely be buying more with full confidence and will probably try other varieties from this seller - although personally I think this combo would be hard to beat.Brookside Dark Chocolate Covered Pomegranates 2lb Bag
1;I came across these @ BJ's last friday and I must say they are superb.  I had to hide the bag from myself...I snack on a few everyday and this bag is just about done.  These are soooo DELICIOUS and because both dark chocolate and pomegranate is good for you I believe this is a very good snack for a sweet tooth.  I'm truly addicted.
1;I do not understand all of the negative reviews. I think this popcorn and the design of the bowl are wonderful. I like to have popcorn on my lunch break at work and there are no big popcorn bowls. Now I no longer have to reach inside a greasy bag to get to the popcorn. I did not notice any unpleasant taste at all.
1;This coffee is a family favorite we cna't keep enough of it in the house. No stores sell vermont blend around the dc/metro area so ordering online is our only solution. Thanks for keeping it in stock for all of us!
1;I love these pops but I wish I could be able to find the sugar free strawberry pop. No one in the state has them. I love this brand of pops they are creamy.There is not one flavour that I dislike. The downfall is that I have seen them at a lover price for the same quantity in other sites.I have given them as a gift before and people love them. I  am still waiting for the other kind of cremosa to be available.
1;"""I received the case of this spice very timely and love the quality.  All I need to do is heat it up and add pepper and I have the start to not only a great dish but healthy nutrient as well ... heating activates it and adding pepper helps it cross the blood-brain barrier.  I add it to scrambled eggs"
1;"""The jury is still out about the efficacy of curcumin (found in turmeric) as a treatment for cancer or Alzheimer's. Not enough testing has been done yet. But it has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for about 4000 years"
1;Tumeric is one of the foods that Dr. William Li recommends for his anti-angiogenesis diet.  It has also been shown to enhance mental capacity.  Simply Organic Tumeric is mildly flavored and the color is sensational.
1;"""Just had this for lunch right now and it was delicious! Very tasteful and goes PERFECTLY over rice. Specifically the KOI Kashmiri Basmati rice! The portions are perfect as well when mixing the two.<br /><br />It was very tasty and quite filling too. This is probably my current favorite KOI meal. I've tried the rajma masala"
1;Very good over rice (I used Jasmati) ... got it on sale and liked it better than the Palak Paneer (also good). Have no idea how this is meant to taste or how it holds up to the real thing.<br /><br />By the last package I was experimenting with adding:<br /><br />Lemon Juice<br />Sriracha<br />Pepper (some salt)<br />Worcestershire Sauce (optional)<br />and Chunk Light Tuna!<br /><br />Divine.
1;"""This Indian dish is delicious! I am a big fan of this brand of indian food. This one is one of my favorites. It is delicious and can easily be stretched to feed more people. The texture out of the package is almost mashed potato-like"
1;This is so far my favorite packaged curry. Its a bit spicy and goes great with rice. I also usually make garlic bread with it and it makes a great meal. Definitely worth the price and very quick and easy to make.
1;I used these delicious kisses for my wedding favors and they added the perfect little touch to go along with my tropical themed wedding by adding just the right pop of blue to go with my oranges and greens!
1;My mom bought these on a trip to Hawaii a few years ago and shared them with all of us.  They were so good and went fast.  I wanted to get her more and was so excited to find them here.  Shipping was fast.  However they leave box on doorstep. So keep warm weather in mind if you wont be home at time of delivery.
1;"""When I was growing up torrones meant that Christmas was very close. The entire family loved this nougat candy and we were sad when it was gone because you had to wait a year before you saw it again. Even the Italian specialty stores only carried it during the Holidays.<br />But"
1;"""I used to get these candies from an Italian deli in San Diego was I was a kid in the late 70s and early 80s. I've long since moved to Utah and have been craving them like crazy but couldn't find them anywhere. But here they are"
1;I think this is a very good torrone product - my family enjoys it and I give it to friends on occasion. I've bought other brands but they were too hard. La Florentine is firm yet chewable and has great flavor. I've purchased this 4-pack several times on Amazon and it has always been fresh.
1;I bought the La Florentine Torrone for a friend's birthday present.  We spent two weeks in Italy last year and spent a lot of time sampling and looking for a torrone that duplicated her childhood memories.  She knew when she opened the box that it was the exact brand her now deceased aunt used to mail her every year for Christmas.  It was the perfect gift!
1;Excellent dessert nougat with great flavor and texture. I would definitely recommend to anyone craving a good almond nougat! I love the individually wrapped & boxed pieces with 3 different flavors and nice Italian graphics on each of the different flavored individual boxes!
1;Good Earth Original Caffeine Free Tea (also available with caffeine) is my favorite tea!  I drink it all day long! I'm always looking for a good price on it and recently discovered that buying it through Amazon is the least expensive way to buy it.  I was also pleased with how quickly it was sent to me.
1;"""There are two versions of this tea.  One is organic without the artificial flavor and the other is the original version.  The artificial flavor is just artificial cinnamon which is what gives it that wonderful taste.  The organic is bland but if you are bothered by the artificial flavor"
1;"""Natural sweetness makes this spicey tea my favorite. The staff at work love the gingerbread-like spicey smell that eminates from my cubicle when I've got a cup brewing.  Because it is herbal and has no caffeine"
1;"""I am a fair weather tea drinker & I can only palate most teas with a lot of sugar.  This tea is the ONE exception.  I first drank this years ago in a Good Earth restaurant (the first really healthy restaurant) & I was hooked immediately!  I have never since found a tea that was even close to this.  Most teas have a leafy"
1;This is the best tea I have ever tasted. It has a blend of cinnamon and spices that make it sweet and spicy. I usually need sugar with my tea but with this tea I never need sugar because it has a naturally sweet taste! Absolutely delightful!
1;This tea is the best you can drink. Naturally sweet. Refreshing after a meal. My whole family loves this tea. I bought two cases and put in in their Christmas stockings. It is too bad I can not find it in the stores.
1;This is a very interesting tea because it requires no sugar.  It is perfect right out of the tea bag.  It has an interesting rich and robust taste that is quite spicy.  My husband likes it cold but I prefer it hot.
1;Until I tried Good Earth Sweet & Spicy Herbal Tea I had tried teas before but never found any that I found just above palatable and/or enjoying it so much that I want more.  I have literally been drinking this every day ever since I first tried it.  I have been telling everyone I meet about it.
1;"""I bought this for my husband for Christmas because I already knew that he loves it so much. He's always amazed that the caffeine free version of this tea has no actual tea in it but tastes the same as the regular Good Earth tea. My only disappointment was that when this arrived at our house"
1;I only make ice tea with this tea and it is simply amazing.  Its simple to do by following the instructions on the box.  I have found that it tastes just as good using 9 bags instead of the recommended 10 bags per 2 quarts of tea.  Sweeten with a bit of Splenda and you have a great diet type beverage that is quite addicting.  The price is unbeatable as well.
1;I LOVE this tea and am so glad Amazon carries it as it is hard to find in the stores. The one place I know that carries it is way more expensive than buying it online.<br />Great herbal tea that is strongly cinnamon and naturally sweet. I don't need to add any sweetner to this. I also find the tea bags go a long way. I only use 2 for a large saucepan full of water. I find the taste is somewhat addicting and I find regular tea boring after drinking this.
1;"""The Sweet and Spicy Caffeine Tea is delicius and natually sweet and herbal so there really is no caffeine.  I just let it steep for at least 15 minutes and even more and the flavor gets better and better. So glad Good Earth corrected the problem with the ink on the tea bags - why on Earth did they need to change from the yellow boxes to the new design?? <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F6SNPS >Good Earth Original Sweet and Spicy Caffeine Free"
1;"""I first found this tea when I was pregnant and on a desperate hunt for something decaffeinated but hot to drink.  Thank goodness I found this at Trader Joe's and tried it! They've since stopped carrying it so I'm thrilled to see it here<br /><br />The flavor is actually as described: sweet and spicy.  I don't have a big sweet tooth anyway but I don't like a bland tea.  This has inherent sweetness and I don't need to put sugar in it.  My husband"
1;"""This is my favorite tea.  It's got a natural sweetness to it that beats any sweet tea I've had.  I use it to make ice tea most of the time.  Great price on Amazon too!<br /><br />Update:  I don't understand why the 18 pack boxes have artificial ingredients listed"
1;I  brew up the tea for iced tea to drink during the day instead of diet sodas.  It is very sweet tasting without the chemicals of diet drinks.  I also understand that the cinnamon helps to regulate my blood sugar from any carbohydrates that I take in.  I no longer find myself craving candies or desserts since I have been drinking this daily.
1;A friend gave me this herbal tea for Christmas & I was hooked immediately! It has enough natural sweetness that it does not need any sweetner added to it. I took a few packs of it to Miami to visit my son & his family & they also loved it! My daughter-in-law found it on Amazon & ordered it for her & me ! I really do drink a cup every morning! Great product & thanks to Amazon a great price!One tip for ordering: make sure you order correctly! There is a caffeine free herbal & another w/ real tea & caffeine. We accidently ordered the one w/ caffeine the first time.
1;I was crushed when Trader Joe's quit carrying Good Earth Tea. I tried to find a substitute but gave up after four tries. So happy to find it on Amazon. The combination of the orange oil and the cinnamon make it naturally sweet.
1;Love Love LOVE the sweet spiciness of this tea.  No need for sweetener or sugar..great replacement for coffee...no other tea compares..can't wait to try the other Good Earth teas..but I buy this flavor by the case and everyone I give a bag to try become fans too!<br /><br />I also love how this tea doubles as aromatherapy everytime I steep a bag!  BUY IT...TRY IT!  Give it as a gift!
1;"""We LOVE this tea!!!<br /><br />It is wonderful to heat a cup of it for a spicy comfort on a cold night.  And it is also wonderful as a cool sweet treat (but without the sugar or calories) on a hot day.<br /><br />It does however have a stronger flavor than some might be wanting.  This is my case for the iced version.  So"
1;This is a smooth soothing cinnamon tea that I love to drink every evening. Lovely without even adding any honey or sugar. I have this auto-delivered every couple of months I love it that much. The rest of my tea collection sits unused while this one gets chosen over and over and over.
1;"""I don't know how they do it - but this tea is sweeter than any other tea on the market.  I like full-bodied flavor in my tea and this delivers.  I also like blending this with other teas - like a green tea or vanilla to vary it's flavor.  I drink this every day.  As someone who can't have any sugar or sweetners of any kind"
1;Yum! A friend introduced me to these. It was love at first bite. They are VERY sweet so they are best consumed in moderation. I put them out for Christmas and they were gone in no time. It is a good thing there were two boxes. One to share. One to NOT share.
1;"""These little gems cap off wonderfully almost any occasion at the dinner table.  Very reasonably priced compared with other brands yet still delicious as ever. Upon arrival each piece was individually slotted"
1;"""I have curly hair and it calms the frizz.  I wish I could still find it in the store but on line is better than not at all!  The scent is subtle and something I can handle since I have trouble with a lot of the  perfume  type scents in other brands."""
1;Actually purchased the Urbani Black Truffle Sea Salt for my daughter. She was very happy with the product after cooking with it. I also had experienced Urbani products in the pass and had only positive results with them.
1;I usually buy my girl friend just plain dark chocolate which she loves. I tried this for a change and she says the flavour of the raspberrys combined with the dark chocolate was great. So great that I never got any.
1;"""Oh Geeze!  These are sooooo good!  I was in San Diego at a conference and found these in the gift shop.  They are wonderful rich dark chocolate squares filled with a generous amount of raspberry cream filling.  They are rich so you probably want to eat about only 2 or 3 at a time with a nice cup of Earl Grey tea.  Of course"
1;These individual bags of Doritos are perfect for me. The bags are a bit larger than my previous order so I only eat one-bag with lunch instead of two of the smaller-sized bags.<br /><br />Yay for Nacho Cheese Doritos!
1;"""The product speaks for itself. I could not find that size bag anywhere and needed it for a fundraiser to make Taco-In-A-Bag. I paid extra to have expedited shipping and was guaranteed delivery on or before 3/25/11 (date of fundraiser). Unfortunately"
1;"""I am generally not a fan of cookies that come from big brands like chips ahoy because they tend to be crunchy and dry and they never live up to the warm delicate cookies that come out of my oven when I bake... and what's the point of eating a snack and taking in all those calories if it isn't perfect! joking... kinda.<br />However"
1;Bought this as a present for my wife (amatuer gourmet chef) and she loves it. Seemed like a better option than the salt samplers with super small amounts of each. There's enough of each of these salts for hundreds of dishes.
1;This is great stuff.  We enjoy it on all things that need a little more seasoning.  Far superior to ordinary table salt in its ability to bring out more flavor from your food.  A small pinch of these salts is all that's needed.
1;Every year I make sugar cookies in the shape of a Christmas tree and ice them with a creamy butter icing which I color green. I then sprinkle this sparkling sugar over the cookies and the result is magical. Everyone who sees the cookies instantly wants one. I also make the cookies for gifts. This year I almost ran out of this sugar so came to amazon to order some more. If you love decorating cookies this is a must-have item. Once you discover India Tree sugars you will want more. Also try their muscovado sugar in anything that has chocolate in it. You will be amazed by the results.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
1;I really enjoyed the Melon flavored Ramune.<br /><br />It has a fun look to it and is great for those who love sweet drinks and don't like or drink caffeine.<br /><br />I being one who avoids caffeine when possible was excited to find a drink I could add to me fridge to give me a change from the few caffeine free drinks I can tolerate.<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone. If nothing else you have to try at least one in your life time.
1;"""Buy this today! We used to bring the large bottles of sauce back to California on a plane when we would visit our daughter at UFL. What a hassle. Then when she graduated I would beg my Florida friends to bring large bottles. Sometimes they would and sometimes they couldn't. I used to measure it out very carefully and only use it for  special dishes  because I wanted it to last longer. NOW I found it on Amazon so I'm a very happy camper!"""
1;I found out about Sonny's BBQ sauce from a former customer who is quite a fine BBQ cook. He always made his own sauce but stopped once he found Sonny's. So...I had to try as is was previously available at my local Sam Club (not this year sad to say). Anyway I tried it and LOVE IT!!! Bought 3 more of the large bottles the next time I went back to Sams just in case they ran out. Great on Chicken and Pork. Glad I found it here on Amazon.
1;The product met all my expectations. It shipped in time for my Cake Pops class and worked beautifully. The flavor was great and the product was fresh. The price was perfect. I will defintely order again.
1;I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED CASHEWS.<br />MOST OF THE CASHEWS AND NUTS OUT THERE NOW ARE DRY ROASTED AND HAVE LOST THEIR GOOD TASTE AND FLAVOR.<br />WHEN I SAW THAT THESE CASHEWS WERE ROASTED IN PEANUT OIL I HAD TO TRY THEM.<br />THIS IS WHAT CASHEWS SHOULD TASTE LIKE.<br />I LOVE THEM AND I'LL BE BACK.
1;"""Purchased two 7' topiaries to place on pillars and flank the interior of my front door. Got the idea from a well known high-end retail store but didn't want the hassle of keeping their  live  product surviving in my home. Found this product online and am extremely satisfied. Product looks natural but still uniform in shape and designed with an adequate amount of greenery"
1;This is pretty good tea.  I use it to make iced tea.  I will usually use two of these tea bags with a few of the cheap plain tea bags in order to make mango tea that doesn't taste like mango juice.  Good stuff at a great price.
1;This tea arrived today.  I opened the first box and immediately made a pitcher of iced tea using four bags.  I'm in trouble now... the tea was so good I've had almost half the pitcher.  No way I'm falling asleep tonight!
1;"""The roasted brown rice in this tea adds a distinctive flavor that can't be compared with anything. I love to start my day with a cup of this tea...the aroma...the exquisite taste. Mmmmmm. I had to drive far to find this tea at a Japanese store in Seattle"
1;"""I brought these as a result of my desire to add  good  nuts to my daily diet.  I had been purchasing the Planter's  energy  mix but they were out of stock so I thought I'd give these a try.  They are fresh and delicious with whole nuts - the walnut pieces are very large (two bites at least).  The mix seems to be mostly almonds and walnuts"
1;"""Being that I am a vegetarian I was having a hard time feeding my dogs Blue Buffalo Chicken kibble. I just could not do it anymore from a moral and ethical standpoint so I started to research 'Vegetarian Dogs' like crazy. Came to find out most dogs who convert to a vegetarian diet thrive on it and I can honestly say this is true. My dogs are ages 2ish"
1;"""My husband and I became vegetarian partly for our health but mostly for the animals of the world and the environment. We have been working on this for 5 months now and started felling guilty that we were letting our dogs contribute to the cruelty of factory farming that we despise. So we read up and made the leap for the dogs as well. We had been feeding Organix brand and mixed the first 28lbs with that to ease them into the life style. I recently ran low and tried a small bag of the Natures Recipe Vegetarian and that wont work for us as our 8 year old pitty refused to eat it"
1;"""My pit bull (2 years old) had been suffering from food allergies from approximately 8 months until a couple months ago. She had sores all over her stomach and when it got really bad they would even go up her back and into her ears. She went to the vet multiple times and the best he could do was put her on steroids and antibiotics. They would go away but then come right back. He put her on the Rabbit and Potato prescription dog food. The food helped and cleared her up but its $75 for a 25lb bag! I am so happy to report that this dog food (mixed with the rabbit and potato) has not brought back any allergies!! So happy and I know she is too :)  Great dog food"
1;My dog has allergies to just about everything but this food is great. He has enjoyed it and also his itchiness has cleared up quite a bit. It's nice to save money by ordering it from amazon instead of from a pet store.
1;this product is excellent. the ingredients are not junk and my cats and dogs love this. too expensive to buy at the vets anymore and bought so many that they will last for a while. i have one cat that just inhales them so i doubt they are doing their job on his teeth but all the other animals do crunch them. not large pieces and can be crumble on food as a treat.
1;"""I have been enjoying a no/low carb no/low sugar journey for three months. Losing my favorite Yoshida's Gourmet sauce marinade was tough. Next I read scores of positive Seal Sama Sugar free user reviews. One mentioned how well it compared to Yoshida's and another noted it was as good as the best non-diet marinades. We bought three bottles.<br /><br />My wife (not needing diet products) and I have all our thumbs WAY UP for Seal Sama. We have now used it on steaks"
1;"""I love this sauce.  I use it mostly in stir-fries but my kids love it on rice.  It is hard to find low carb condiments to replace some of the products I used before and I was SO happy when I discovered this one.  I usually buy 6 bottles at a time so there is always one on hand.  It handles well in cooking and also is great out of the bottle if you want to add it after the food is prepared.  It is sweet like teriyaki should be but isn't overly sweet or  fake  tasting"
1;"""I like this stuff!  Good source of various vitamins (esp potassium) and it seems to give me energy without some of the adverse effects of other energy drinks.  Not a significantly high amount of caffine which I like.  Heck"
1;"""I am a 53 year old female who has been working out 6 mornings a week for years and this product is awesome!.  I have taken this product prior to my morning work out for about 2 years. I have been out of it for a week and can really tell the difference. Also"
1;"""I never liked Monster or Red Bull energy drinks plus they were costly.  I bought a box of this stuff at Costco and enjoy it before hitting the gym.  I stopped drinking coffee so this is helping me get through long afternoons at work.  I can't believe how sweet it is without sugar.  The packaging is small and I keep it in my office drawer.  I wish it wasn't packaged in plastic though.  Anyway"
1;"""I have to say that this pink lemonade flavor is simply delightful! I started drinking zipfizz to quash my overwhelming addiction to caffeine that had spiraled out of control.  I find that I have received the same pick-me-up that I was getting from 500-600mg of caffeine.  While ZipFizz does have 100mg of caffeine"
1;Found this product initially at Costco and wanted more of one flavor.  Found it offered on Amazon when the Costco no longer stocked the item and was more than happy with the order of Citrus flavor 20 tube boxes I received.
1;"""I have been drinking ZIPFIZZ for a couple of weeks now.  So far my favorite flavor is the Orange.  At first I drank it like medicine... just for the energy.  Now I look forward to it.<br /><br />I was usually very groggy in the AM.  I drank several cups of coffee to wake up"
1;"""Zipfizz is a great tasting easy to use energy drink.  The price per unit is less expensive than other bottled energy drinks.  Just mix it into a 12 or 16 oz bottle of purified water and shake.  One word of caution"
1;I've been trying zipfizz lately and I'm very surprised at how well this drink seems to be working.  Gives me steady energy without the weird crash I might get from Red Bull or Amp or something juiced with a ton of sugar.  Seems to have a lot of vitamins as well so it's actually good for you!
1;"""Grape zipfizz will not dissapoint. It is the least bitter out of their lineup and gives you a great energy boost that doesn't knock you out in 2 hours. I also like how I can fill up a bottle with it instead of having a shot like those other drinks. I like to enjoy it and sip slowly"
1;when i ordered this it was the best price on the net for product and shipping on the individual flavor but i have since changed to ordering it from costco because this price went up or they stopped carrying it at least expensive merchant. its a great product i love it i just dont like every flavor so i dont want to order multi paks of it.
1;I have ordered many boxes of the citrus zipp fizz. This is one of the few places I can get the citrus only (I don't like the combo packs) at a reasonable price. I have never had a problem and I find that I enjoy the zipp fizz in the morning just as much as a cup of coffee.
1;"""I discovered zipfizz about a year ago working for a local gym. I LOVE IT! I have to wake up VERY early for work and zipfizz gives me that little boost i need. Not to mention the taste---it is amazing :). Pink Lemonade is my personal favorite"
1;"""I love this product. Zipfizz gives me what I need to make it through the day at work. The flavors are all great. My favorite is the pink lemonaid. I usually drink it down pretty fast. My body and mind feel instantly better"

The garlic tastes fresher than the garlic in my fridge...it's amazing and ORGANIC....maybe that's why it tastes so rich??"""
1;"""This jerky is my favorite snack treat.  I buy it in quantities of ten packages at a time because it goes that fast.  I can eat a bag by myself in one sitting.  It is highly addictive.  The honey pepper flavor is my favorite kind.<br /><br />I bought a bag of this to work"
1;"""Honey Pepper Jerky<br /><br />I ordered <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IA99FS >Buffalo Bills 8oz Barbecue Country Cut Beef Jerky Pack</a>and got a free sample of <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IA3RV0 >Buffalo Bills 8oz Honey Pepper Country Cut Beef Jerky Pack</a><br />This is almost as good as the <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IA99FS >Buffalo Bills 8oz Barbecue Country Cut Beef Jerky Pack</a>or the  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IA3S1Y >Buffalo Bills 8oz Teriyaki Country Cut Beef Jerky Pack</a>.  It has a slight peppery aftertaste that disappears when you drink a swallow of your drink.<br />.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. Since I'm a diabetic I should say it has only 2 grams of carbohydrates per 1 ounce serving.<br /><br />Gunner January"
1;Received my order of Honey Pepper Jerky a couple days ago.  The jerky is sweet and the pepper is very good without being overwhelming. I generally prefer jerky that is very dry and chewy but I really enjoyed the taste and texture of this product.  I would not hesitate to order again or recommend to others.
1;buffalo bills jerky is by far the best jerky ever i have ever had i made it point to review it to let every one know i was alittle worried bout getting food from somewhere like amazon but man its awsome tyvm buffalo bills
1;I anticipated not being a fan (because I don't really like sweet all that much) and was very pleasantly surprised.  This jerky was great!  The pepper must've offset the sweetness of the honey because I really liked it.<br /><br />I've always thought i liked my jerky dry but these country cut products are starting to change my mind.
1;"""Purchased these during a fantastic Grocery Deals promotion. I am in my car a lot for work and find that I don't eat properly.  One of my NY Resolutions was to at least find healthier ways of eating poorly :) .  The best thing about this mix is NO RAISINS. I am one of those people that dislike raisins and it has always been an issue with trail mix.  The mix is a perfect balance of nuts"
1;A friend brought these to work one day and I tried them and loved them.  I found them on Amazon.com and ordered.  I placed my second order some time back.  They make a great little snack when you want something sweet and healthy at the same time.  I'm hooked.
1;"""My boyfriend was looking for a high energy trail mix especially when he's out early on the golf course and nothing compares to this Tropical Blend. It gives him the energy throughout the round without crashing like those energy drinks"
1;The tea was delivered as promised in a timely manner.  I am enjoying the fresh brew daily and was satisfied with the service.  No glitches and as described.  A 6 pack allows one to enjoy the tea with no fear of running out and there is plenty to give a box as a gift to let a friend sample it as well.
1;This is are little guys favorite.He loves rabbit over any other flavor.Living in the middle of no were we dont have local places to purchas high quality foods for are terrier.Excellent product just right size for small dogs.We purchased a varity pack online for him and let him choose which product he liked best and this was it.
1;"""I switched to this food about two months ago and it's a perfect fit for my dog. He has a sensitive digestive system and I was looking for a corn- and wheat-free food. He also has joint issues (ACL surgery 6 months ago)"
1;My dog loves this pet food. What I love the most about it is that it's about the same price or cheaper than at a store and Amazon will ship this to me for free! Saves a trip lugging a huge bag of dog food home.

Now I get to add their hot sauces to my collection . This is a very nice gift idea for a sauce collector or a fan of their movies"""
1;"""This is the best tasting salt I've ever had.  I learned about this after starting a  raw  diet and I was obsessed about having everything raw.  I'm a condiment queen and it was really hard for me to give up a lot of my condiments (ketchup"
1;I do a lot of Cajun cooking. I have been making my own seasoning combinations for a while.. I try to keep MSG and sugar out of my diet. I decided to give this a try. I made a pot of chilly. The only change I made this time was this salt. It was AMAZING!! My only regret now is that I only ordered a pound. Next time it will be more.<br /><br />This salt is also a great for exfoliation in the bath!<br /><br />One note: do be sure to add several grains of uncooked rice to the package as soon as you open it. It does start to clump rather quickly.
1;This salt is very tasty and really adds a nice touch to any dish. It is great to sprinkle on right before serving. The grind is just right for use as a finishing salt. I would definitely not cook with this particular salt due to its potency.
1;The best salt of all sea salts!!!  There's nothing I can say that the other reviewers have already said.  This is truly the most delicious of salts.  Try a sprinkle on popcorn with a teaspoon of white truffle oil.  YUM!!
1;Switched totally to Himalayan Salt several years ago because of its' health qualities.<br />Have paid lots more in retail stores.  For the price this product is a great value.<br />The salt also shakes out easily from my salt container.  Have never had any clumping occur.<br />Will continue to purchase in the future.
1;Perfectly ground Himalayan salt or pink salt.  This was recommended by a holistic practioner and is stronger tasting than regular salt.  I use this salt for all my salt uses including cooking but cut the amount in half since it is so salty.  This salt is not processed like other salts so is not iodized if you need that process.  We like it much better that our regular table or kosher salt.
1;I had been looking for this for a while and hadn't been able locate it locally. I prefer it over sea salt or kosher. It is amazingly smooth with slight but perceptible mineral notes in the flavor. Kosher type salts seem to have a sharper edge to the taste. I highly recommend it for steaks or grilled salmon. It also gives a unique flavor and appearance to margaritas. Wonderful product.
1;The salt is great quality and taste - if you haven't already stooped using table salt (Sodium Chloride) I urge you to read about the benefits of using Himalayan salt - not only does it taste better - it is much better for your health.
1;"""One reviewer  described The spice Lab Finely Ground Himalayan Salt  grains as being too  being large.  Not mine.  Mine  is finer than course kosher salt.<br /> I ordered a small package first to check it out and now I am ready to spring for a big one.<br /> It seems to take less salt"
1;What a fine product! I do not think I can ever use any other kind of salt from now on. Food comes alive and you use so much less salt.I will buy it all the time now. fast delivery and a good price as well.
1;I bought this at the same time as the course salt and was very happy with both.  They are as they described.  I put this one in my kitchen salt shaker.  Spice Lab puts out a quality product at a reasonable price.
1;I often offer these crackers with Boursin cheese to my guests and everyone LOVES it.  They comment on both the cheese and these Panzanella crackers.  I used to buy the big ones and break them up.  I am glad I found the minis.
1;"""These pumps are very durable.  I've been using the same pump for over a year for my Torani coffee syrups and have no problem with them whatsoever.  The fit is perfect and I never have syrup running down the side of the bottle. The only thing I make sure I do when changing the bottles is rinsing out the pump as sugar crystals can dry around the pump mechanism and cause the pump to get stuck.  Cleaning is easy:  just let the pump soak in clean"
1;"""I bought these to go with my sugar free syrups that I bought in a sampler pack.  The pumps work very well and make sampling or mixing the syrups with my coffee a real treat.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that they would ship 6 instead of 5 to match the sampler pack.<br /><br />A tip: Before inserting the pump fully into a newly opened bottle"
1;We purchased these pumps to go with the 25.4-Ounce bottles of Torani Syrup we ordered. They work as advertised. They fit perfectly in the bottles and provide the exact amount of syrup we need. Of course some testing will be required to obtain the amount required for your own taste.
1;"""These pumps make it so easy to dispense Torani syrups. No mess and consistent amount. Be sure to draw syrup into the tube on first use before inserting into the bottle - otherwise you'll spill it over the top of the bottle. NBD. Possible negative is how tall they make the bottles 15  tall. I keep mine on the wet bar counter where I've set up my  coffee bar"
1;I use these with my Torani coffee syrups at home.  I love them.  I can make my own coffee house drinks without paying the coffee house prices.  By using the pumps I don't spill or have syrup running down the bottle.
1;Great price & product! How much easier it makes my morning cup of coffee or my afternoon latte to not have to screw off a top & get syrup all over the kitchen.  Just a few pumps from the Torani syrup pump & I'm through.  Thanks Torani & Amazon!
1;"""These pumps fit the 25.4oz Torani syrup bottles perfectly.<br /><br />I do want to mention that with a brand new Torani bottle you may want to dispense by pouring the first splash of syrup.  I've had new bottles be so close to full that when placing the pump into them"
1;I've been wanting to get these for awhile and finally broke down. So fun! I actually use Davinci syrups from Sam's and these work just fine. I like the sugar free flavorings for my coffee and smoothies. Two squirts = perfect taste. Love it!
1;I love love love the Torani Sugar-Free Syrups and I now have my own little barista in my kitchen with easy access pumps that I use for everything from my morning coffee to my girls night mixed vodka drinks!
1;Very Own Coffee Bar...OKAY!<br /><br />This pump works very well with Torani Syrups! We built our own coffee bar at home for entertaining (and to get away from overpriced mega coffee chains) and this made measuring very accurate in a second!
1;"""TVP is the same base ingredient used for Morningstar  Crumbles  and Boca  Ground Beef  substitute.  The difference?  Pure TVP doesn't have the HUGE amount of added sodium in the aforementioned products (check the labels)"
1;Bob's Red Mill Textured Vegetable Protein is an excellent product and makes a great vegetarian substitute for ground beef.  I reconstitute it adding enough Kitchen Bouquet Seasoning Sauce which makes it look just like ground beef
1;Good replacement for meat. I wanted a vegetable protein to combine with meat so that my family eat less meat everyday but get enough protein. I am satisfied with my choice. It is very easy to use and gets taste of your meal.
1;... This is the best canned chili I've ever had.. Bought STAGG Chili once in awhile.. But their Dynamite Chili is the best.. Not to hot & Great taste.. I'll be buy more each month.. Once in a while I kick it up a notch with some jalapeno peppers.. But that's just me ... lol
1;"""I had these back in Sweden since i was a kid and they have always been in my candy bag as standard.<br /><br />It has that perfect gummy texture that no other candy have. I wish US could import more swedish/german candy"
1;loved my Americans for years.  for those that do not know what this is at all well is is a tootsie roll with a hard candy around this tootsie roll.  the tootsie roll is in the middle and the hard lolly pop part is over that.  so when you get all of the pop done with then got tootsie roll.  they come in many flavors.  they are a kid favorite.
1;"""I thought I would add my two cents about the selection of flavors.<br />It was supposed to be 100 pops. but was given 103.<br />Here is the breakdown of flavors:<br />43 cherry<br />16 chocolate<br />13 orange<br />13 raspberry<br />10 grape<br />8 green ( green apple"
1;"""I purchased a 5 100 count box bundle from Tootsie and was very pleased with their responsiveness and timing.

1;"""I received my product today along with other items all in great condition as usual. Thanks Amazon. These ole school favorites are advertised by this seller (DAB Unlimited) as described of which is very important to me as an online consumer. The picture displayed is what I exactly received.

As you have probably read before purchasing"
1;I have been doing a feral cat program for awhile now. The food is important but they love good cat nip and I HAVE FOUND IT !!!!!This is like medical marijuana to my wild cats. In the worst of times they sniff and eat this and get through the cold and fight to keep their territory...I love my TNR program I donated to Denver for wonderful reasons. We elders must set a example..Thank You Amazon and all the  stores and fast delivery bundling and easy open packaging.. I don't take enough time to thank you and the wonderful people who deliver all my STUFF THANKS THANKS and ALWAYS BE HAPPY :)
1;"""This is a huge bag so I placed it in a freezer zip-lock bag and keep it in the refrigerator bin. It helps keep it fresh for months. This is by far the freshest nip I've ever purchased. My cats love catnip"
1;More catnip than I imagine :) would last for months with 1 bag. Nice foil like package keep the catnip smell from escaping. 5 star :). purchased 3/21/2012. way cheaper than the 3$ from pet store if buying 2 package only 25$ free shiping deal is so good saving 8-9$ on shipping alone :).
1;I ordered this the same day as some Herbes De Provence and put the catnip on autoship so didn't realize it was shipped together until my little furry little drug fiends dug out and pushed aside my Herbes to get at their own herbs! It has wonderful aroma that even I with my puny human nose can smell. So glad I found this excellent deal on organic catnip for my furbabies now sleeping off their nip :)
1;Product is the highest quality .My cats are getting through self lock down as the snow and cold keep them from wanting to go out .They race around and see things and then sleep for a while .Perfecto !!!
1;"""Now I know what a pound of catnip looks like. I just cracked it open and the cat is going bonkers. I hope I get through the whole thing before it (if it) goes stale. Good price if you don't have the weed growing around your home"
1;This is a LOT of catnip! I have yet to try this as a tea but my kitty is very happy with this organic catnip. A pound will pretty much outlive all of your cat's 9 lives and then some but whatta deal! I'm going to give some to my daughter for her cats and to my neighbors for their cats because this is a ridiculous amount of nip. For all intents and purposes I'd say this is an excellent quality nip and a great value.
1;"""MUCH TO MY DISMAY WHOLE FOODS NO LONGER CARRIES OLD WESSEX FIVE GRAIN CEREAL. I USUALLY STOCK UP ON IT WHEN I GO TO THE STORE. I HAD TO ORDER IT ON LINE AND TAKE A CASE.  MY GRANDAUGHTER WHO IS EIGHT WAS EATING IT OUT OF THE BOX. I GAVE MY DAUGHTER A FEW BOXES AND SHE MADE HER FAMOUS COOKIES WITH CHOCOLATE CHIPS FROM THE RECIPE ON THE BOX. I USUALLY DON'T GET TO EAT LUNCH UNTIL AFTER TWO O'CLOCK SO THIS CEREAL REALLY KEEPS ME WELL FORTIFIED.  I ADD PROTEIN POWDER"
1;"""I've been eating this cereal almost every morning for years.  I have been buying it by the case from my local health-food store but I see Amazon sells it for less AND will deliver it for free.  I love the convenience of this cereal.  It cooks in 6 minutes and is highly portable for breakfast on the go.  I have been cooking it with a small handful of 'craisins' to add a little sweetness.  I like that it isn't mushy like oatmeal.  The nutty taste and texture appeal to me even if there's an occasional husk mixed in.  I wonder if more people"
1;If you love HP sauce (you probably wouldn't be looking at buying it in bulk unless you do) this is definitely the way to go.  It tastes as good as it ever did and seems to keep without deteriorating at all (in a cool place but not necessarily refrigerated).  My family loves it on many savory items (anything from breakfast eggs to burgers and steak) and we add it to bean dishes and homemade barbeque sauce too.<br /><br />Unreservedly 5 stars!<br /><br />Just wish we could buy Lea and Perrins Worchestershire sauce and Marmite in bulk too...
1;Snapples Raspberry ICe Tea mix for water in single packets is the best.  I found it in the stores last year and fell in love with it..... then it disappeared. Found it on Amazon... costs way more than I paid for it in the store but I had to have my fix that I take with me to the gym almost everyday.  Great stuff!
1;The image displayed by amazon shows a can of light coconut milk. I was pleasantly surprised when the coconut milk arrived and it was not light. One can of this goes a long way! Great bargain for coconut milk!
1;Most everyone has had a triscuit before. We like tem in our family because the ingredients are so minimal and basic.  Ordering them through Amazon was a good choice because I know the product and I know we will eat them. I did some price comparing with my local supermarket before making the purchase and it was worth a bit of savings on the family size boxes.
1;I have been a slim fast drinker for years. One taste of this shake and I'm hooked! I like to put it in the freezer for about 30 min. before drinking it so it is nice and COLD. I love chocolate so the milk chocolate flavor is my pick. It is a much smoother chocolate than the slim fast milk chocolate. I just wish it came in 6 or bonus 8 pack like the slim fast. So far I've only seen it in 4 pack. Because of this it is a bit more costly than slim fast. But again the taste is much better. I highly recommend it!!
1;"""I have now become a fitness queen working out between five to six days a week. A trainer told me that after each workout I need to replinish my protein. After trying various protein shakes from the health club"
1;This is my favorite brand of Earl Grey. This also happens to be the best price I have found for a pack of 50 bags. And you can get free shipping on it if it's part of a larger order on Amazon. It's a win all around.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
1;i have 5 rat terries and they love these things. they are good for them as they are mostly natural which is good due to i have one that can not have much crude fat. just have to shop around to see who has best prices as they can be expensive.
1;"""We have bought almost every type of dog treats for our two Yorkies and when they (not us) like a product we buy it until it is no longer available.  Piggy Puffs is one of those the dogs like.  Really like.  When the bag comes out of hiding they are standing there with their ears perked and ready to eat.  Other treats do not get anywhere near the reception.  While Yorkies are know as yappers among other things these two just settle down with their Piggy Puff and grant us peace and quiet.  We have never had an instance of choking such as some treats have a tendency to do nor have we noticed any negative results in their stools.  All around"
1;Used to find it local. Like other items I use the store stopped carrying it! Thanks to Amazon for carrying it and other items I like! This rice has a nutty scent when cooking and lends itself well to different flavors of various dishes. It also works well for me as a diabetic and helps with my digestive system when it is out of order. If you are trying to eat healthy then this is a great product for you!
1;We all know that Brown Rice is a better choice for health and longevity.<br /><br />But this is better than buying it at the grocery store.  More affordable and shipped straight to your door.  I've turned many friends on to buying rice and other dry grocery goods on Amazon.<br /><br />Subscribe and Save is a must.
1;"""Ok.....I cannot compare this large can to the smaller cans from the same company because I have never bought tuna from this company.  I have always bought whatever store tuna was on sale.

1;"""i put this on my dog's leash since many times i would forget the plastic bag until i was already outside.  it really comes in handy.  i especially like the fact that right before each perforation there is a white stripe so that you know where to tear.  it comes in handy at night.  they are also very dark"
1;I used to salvage plastic bags from the grocery stores etc. to dispose of kitty litter waste but recently I have stopped using plastic bags and am using cloth bags for my shopping. I purchased these bags because they are the perfect size for multiple daily waste removal (the litter scoop fits right into the bag) and because they are environmentally friendly. I attached the little dispenser right onto the litter box (it comes with a plastic zip tie) and it is super convenient to have the perfect little sized bags ready to go. I have not had a problem with tearing or holes in the bags and they are easy to tie up after use. Will purchase plenty of refills!

1;"""I have to rely on protein shakes to meet my protein quota of 80 grams a day.  I tell you this product makes it very easy to meet my goals.  IT TASTES GREAT!  I love Lean Body's shakes and this is the best of them all.  I usually would not reach for Vanilla flavored anything...just chocolate.  I tried this one because it was all that was left in the gym and now I know I had been missing out.  This is the best protein shake and ...it is filling"
1;"""have to disagree with the other reviewer. these sardines are large (usually 4 or 5 per can) and firm. they have a nice flavor without the overly  fishy  or  oily  textures of some of the other brands. within the varieties offered by Wild Planet"
1;Our 10 year old pointer / husky cross has been a picky eater the last few years.  I was told this was a great one try to get away from the basic chicken formulas.  Our dog absolutely  loves it !  In less than 2 weeks we have seen a noticeable difference her in coat as well.  It's shiny and feels really soft.  Really pleased with this.  Worth the price !  We were also told to occasionally switch formulas  of meat so that they don't get tired of their food.  Example :  chicken to duck  to fish.  Great idea !
1;So this does not beat my love for macadamia nut matcha and I probably even like the almond matcha more HOWEVER this is a very good matcha!<br />Its funny because pistachios are my favorite nut although macadamia does run a close second the things are just too darn expensive! Not that pistachios are cheap or anything but for the price - heck I will just buy matcha instead!<br />This pistachio matcha really does smell like pistachio.<br />There is a slight very slight chemical like smell but it does not come out in the blend when you make your matcha regardless of if you use just water or make a latte with it.<br />I really do like this matcha and the base comes through very nicely and with pistachio for some reason seems to make even more sense because pistachios have green on them. Yeah I know its a mental thing and I am after all somewhat mental however this may also be quite nice in a white base as well!<br />Try as many of these Red Leaf Matcha as you can you won't be unhappy with your matcha flavors!
1;"""I was a little surprised by how big these are...they are not the standard size for sugar cones and can fit a large amount of ice cream.  (That can be a good or a bad thing depending on your goal.)  They are packaged very safely but once they are out of the pack they crumble very easily and I've had disappointed kids on a few occasions.  Still"
1;I had a bottle of this sitting on my counter for a while. Tropical flavors are so hit and miss. So when I ran out of my favorite Flavrz (Cherry Berry) I pulled this one out.  I was so pleasantly surprised that it had a coconut flavor to it. SOLD. I went through the entire bottle in less than a few days. I really recommend the packets more than the bottle. They seem to last longer for me. :)
1;I discovered Flavrz while looking for a way to flavor water so I wouldn't drink so much soda. I found that almost every flavor packet had artificial sweeteners in them. Flavrz was the only one I found without artificial sweetners. The taste is excellent. Super happy with the product. Just wish my local supermarket would keep it stocked.
1;"""Yep I used to get them for free. All you had to do was go out into the field in Viet Nam (67-68). And they would send a box of goodies  Sundries Pack (SP)  that would have Chuckles on the top layer. You guessed it when the box was opened it looked like a shark feeding frenzy. I guess I never got over it and to this day have to have a Chuckles fix periodically.<br /><br />The sugar coating keeps them from being sticky. The artificial flavors are seductive. The black ones taste like licorice."""
1;"""Hands down the best cubes to use for absinthe and I mean superior to the slightly refined white cubes. There's just something fittingly Belle Epoque about the raw brown cane sugar cubes. At first I thought the price was a little high but since it's four boxes it works out to be a little cheaper than buying them in the store. I think it rather comes down to how often you foresee yourself using sugar cubes. I'd absolutely recommend the cubes in terms of quality"
1;"""My kids are addicted to candy (like most other children) and tend to shy away from fresh fruit when I try to put fruit in their lunch boxes but they ABSOLUTELY LOVE these apple and cherry natural fruit bars. To them"
1;"""Love these fruit bars.  Can't compare to the other ones.  Other bars are  heavy  tasting and always leave an after-taste.  The  That's it  bars have a lovely and subtle real taste of the fruit and no after-taste. Wonderful to read the ingredients and only have 2 ...  both natural."""
1;I don't have time for fruit! Saw these in my building lobby shop in Century City...gave them a try and came back the same afternoon to buy a few of all 3 flavors.  Easy/healthy way for me to get my fruit without having to peel anything! The cherry version is amazing and so is the pear!!
1;"""Fresh and tasty corn.  I just got back into making popcorn old fashioned style (on the stove) and what a difference.  The microwave popcorn that everyone is eating is like super salty cardboard compared to stove-top popcorn.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor - try this stuff (they have smaller sizes).  I promise"
1;"""As a long-time fan of Dr. Pepper I thought I'd give this sauce a try. I wasn't expecting it to taste very much like Dr. Pepper and figured it'd just be a pretty standard barbecue. Not only does it have the distinct Dr. Pepper flavoring"

1;This was the very best lamb's head that we roasted for Easter dinner! It was of a very high quality and every last bit was eaten up with the children fighting over who got the eye balls and the tongue!
1;"""I bought this without a review which is rare for me.  I did it because I love castlevetrano olives and I can't get them locally.  I was worried because it's just a big can and I had read poor reviews on Roland other olives.<br /><br />I must say"
1;"""I have a 10 1/2 year old chow-shepard mix... a big girl about 95 pounds.  She started showing some signs of something hurting her as she laid or sat down and then when getting back up.  She didn't have a lot of energy to play or to go for a walk.  The Vet said she's getting arthritis we should try to give her some supplements.<br />We came across these at a mega-pet store and bought a package.  I've followed up with two more and about to buy another to be the fourth month of this experiment.<br />Does this work?  Well"
1;"""I'm so glad that a women at my local PetSmart recommended these for our Dalmatian! They are much better than the pills and have more glucosamine than supplements. Before taking these she was having trouble getting up and down the stairs"
1;My little toy poodle takes a 1/2 of one every day.  They really help with her bad knees.  Hopefully they will work for a long time.  Otherwise she will have to take prescription medication or have surgery.
1;"""I am so glad to have found this product.  My dog had a problem on walks when he would have to pull up his rear leg and hop.  As a puppy he was operated on with little success. The Doctor said it was common in Yorkies and there was nothing more they could do.  Now he is 4 years old and with the addition of Greenies Joint Care I rarely see him limp. He LOVES the taste"
1;"""I used these for making the  ladybug cake bits  from the Cake Pops baking book and they were great!  Easy to use and stuck very easily to the cake bite.  I used a tooth pick and the melted chocolate to apply the lips to the cake bite and it worked great!  I will definitely use them again!"""
1;"""I have been using this product for many years. It makes the best sauce ever.  We use it plain a lot as I have food allergies and it tastes great plain.<br /><br />The problem I have with ordering from Amazon for this product ONLY is that most of the cans arrive dented.  Amazon is great and sent me another shipment for free.<br />However that shipment had dented cans also!<br /><br />I recommend this product highly"
1;It's her favorite dry food and her day is not complete without a heaping cup in her dish.  This is a new packaging approach for us and I think I'm going to like it because it came in bulk at a very reasonable price and should stay fresh in the unopened boxes longer than the larger bags do.  It's also much easier for her assistant to pick up the smaller sizes than the usual heavier bags!  
1;I was worried after reading other reviews about receiving dented cans.  I decided to take my chances for $1.77/can vs paying $2.50-$3 per can at my local grocery stores.  I just received my shipment and inspected all the cans. Everything is perfect!  No dents and far away expiration dates.  This is the exact stuff that's available in the stores now.  We go thru this like crazy and so glad I'm able to get it at a great discount.
1;my dog is in his second remission from lymphoma and the doctor suggested a grain-free cooked diet. he is 3 years out from his initial diagnosis and people can't believe his age (10) or that he's ever been sick!  the product arrives consistently well-packed and the quality of the food itself is consistent. i'll admit that my dog has a healthier diet than i do!
1;"""I know this product is listed for dogs but my cats love it.  They are not beggars but when we have smoked salmon out they go nuts and this is the next best thing.  Even my shy boy who does not usually take treats goes for it.  I am not a pet food expert but this looks like it is  basically just dried salmon and has to be good for them. Great product"
1;It's a staple in many Asian recipes but here's a tip... add a teaspoon to any instant noodle and it will bring the broth to life! It was a stalwart companion during my years of living in the dorm room.
1;"""This oil is fantastic for many great tasting recipes and for Asian cooking in general. Also this oil seems to withstand high heat without burning. In my house we use it all the time for many different dishes. Sesame oil contains vitamin E which is an anti-oxidant. This means it helps lower your cholesterol.<br /><br />I like to cut up broccoli"
1;"""These are hands down the best cookies I have ever eaten! That includes regular cookies before I was diagosed gluton intolerant. They are crisp and crunchy and then you get this little zing of chewy crystalized ginger. I really have to exercise self control and ration myself or I could eat the whole box. Love"
1;If you prefer a less earthy matcha and the health benefits of a white tea this is the way to go! I want to address that Red Leaf Tea has an excellent QUALITY tea provided to you! Customer service is excellent as well! I was very pleased with my purchase of this white matcha from Red Leaf Tea.
1;"""I routinely keep a stockpile of up to fifty (yes that's 50) hot sauces in my refigerator. It is safe to say that I have a hot sauce  problem . This is the sauce that gets used the fastest and re-purchased the most often. It is not a  typical  sauce by any means - It has a fruity flavor"
1;I give my Catahoula one Dentastix after her breakfast and one after her dinner. (I was delighted to find the Dentastix available in this 40-count economy size on Amazon.  I haven't been able to find these super-size bags in my pet store).  I find it very hard to brush her teeth (she HATES it) so I thought this would be a good alternative.  I think I was right.  The dog is 7 years old and the veterinarian says her teeth are beautiful.  She could do commercials for a toothpaste company!!  After she's eaten her meal(s) she automatically goes for the stix so I assume they are tasty.  Because of the veterinarian's glowing remarks re the condition of the dogs teeth I believe I can safely say that the Dentastix are doing their job.
1;"""I've been using Batch #37 ( The Batch ) for YEARS and it is hands down my favorite hot sauce. I recall when I first stumbled upon The Batch I thought it was so good that I went out and ordered all the Pain Is Good hot sauces to give them a try. Some were good"
1;"""This is an amazing hot sauce for those who really like to kick it up a notch without inducing extreme pain. It has the perfect blend of heat and flavor and it goes with everything. I have a collection of hot sauces"
1;"""I found this hot sauce while shopping in old town St. Augustine Florida. The store was filled with Sauces of every kind. I asked the woman working there for her favorite and she instantly led me to the-Made in Florida-Gator Hammock.  Now I order by the case. I can not be without... seriously.  It is a sauce with a full and unique flavor. Delicious. I have also purchased their other flavors. Lethal Hammock -wonderfully Really Hot. Swamp Gator medium heat and of course Gator which is mild but hot. Their sprinkles are great too"
1;"""This sauce is awesome.  I went on a month long quest for the next best table hot sauce.  I read a million reviews from different hot sauce sites only to order product after product and finding it flavorless"
1;"""I normally make my own baby food...but I could not duplicate the great taste of this one.  My older girl (who is now 1.5) still loves her green  smoothie  and eats it by herself.  Great on trips or when you are out.  I started giving it to my 6mo old and she loves it too!!!  Definitely worth spending a little extra if my kids are going to eat spinach!!!"""
1;This is such a great product. I love that it's all organic and my 8 month old son LOVES sucking the puree out of these pouches. I keep one in the bottom of the diaper bag so we always have something on hand if errands start running long.
1;My daughter really likes this product.  She seems to like all of the Plum Organics products we've tried thus far so I would say this is a pretty safe purchase for those who haven't given it to their baby yet.
1;I love anchovies. These are a great value. Some folks do not care for anchovies because of the saltiness. I find if you rinse them cold water first and then use a little lemon jouice on them it cuts the salt factor by half. Enjoy!!
1;"""You will see other reviews criticizing this syrup as not being like Lyle's.  Different uses!!  Lyle's is excellent for baking and making desserts but not for beverages.<br /><br />I like this Monin syrup to sweeten drinks!  It is awesome for that purpose.  I make fresh limeade for Margaritas with this ----way way better than a crummy store-bought Margarita mix.  Ever try to sweeten a beverage with granulated sugar?  Gross.  It doesn't melt.  All you do is add this syrup and it's great.  Great to add into iced tea too.<br /><br />Get the pump if you think you will use it to sweeten by the glass.  Otherwise you can just pour out of the bottle for larger batch drinks.  It's also really good to add into whipped cream if you are making that from scratch - but I actually prefer to use the vanilla flavored Monin for that.<br /><br />Monin syrups are high quality - I've been using them for years in my coffee (caramel"
1;I ordered Koppers New York Expresso Coffe Beans for the Candy Buffet at my daughters wedding.  Everyone loved them!  They were the most talked about and without a doubt the favorite!  So glad I found them on Amazon!  I may have to order more just to have around!
1;"""These are the cinnamon candies I remember from long ago!! Melt in your mouth and super cinnamon taste. Arrived in great condition. Thanks! If you can find them today they are usually extremely hard and not very tasty. These will be perfect for cooking"
1;"""<span class= tiny > Length:: 0:48 Mins<br /><br /></span>Hi! I hope you enjoy your soy nuts as much as I do! This is truly a great product!<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ARIFGM >Truson Organics Dry Roasted Soy Nuts Sea Salt"
1;"""I needed the bigger tubs as I use Knox Gelatin for my Greek Yogurt... 1 Tablespoon adds 8 grams protein and creates a  cheesecake texture  to my daily non-flavored yogurt ... with a dash of sweetner"
1;"""I ordered this bulk container of gelatin because I was getting fed up with all the additives in flavored gelatin available from the grocery stores. To get the equivalent of a normal box of gelatin you use 2 teaspoons full from this container. I used the recipe on the can for knox blocks using 'Newman's own Grape Juice' and they were the best jigglers substitute I've had in a long time. Instead of there being 15 ingredients of questionable origin"
1;I have been using this salt since the 70's. Has a unique salt/deep green leafy veggie & celery flavor that makes ordinary food special without changing character of dish.  Especially good on popcorn.  Only shake a tiny little bit out until you know how it works.  Holes are large and let too much salt flow thru if not careful.
1;"""Vege-sal has been used in our home daily for decades.  We love it in/on everything from soup to popcorn to scrambled eggs.  I'm sorry to say that at this time I can't buy this product on Amazon because the 20 oz boxes are not available for Prime shipping.  Using it as often as we do"
1;Our three-month-old son has GERD and we were in dire straits trying to find a solution. The doctor tried several medications but it really didn't matter because he'd spit them up every time. She gave us a sample of this formula to try and voila! Our son still struggles with his reflux but he's not the vomit factory he once was. Bonus - he sleeps 12 hours straight at night now (don't hate me).<br /><br />We are converts. Our daughter was a Similac baby but Enfamil A.R. saved our sanity and our son's health.
1;"""to me any of the mcdougall products are an awesome score.<br /><br />i have tried almost all of their soups. since those where tasty i thought i would give the oatmeal a try.<br /><br />it was perfect. i cooked it per instructions and enjoyed. i really like that is it organic"
1;"""This is a wonderful product and the best feature is the fact that it is healthy and very convenient - the packaging is very good and preparation is fast.  The taste is wonderful.  Because it is high in fiber"
1;I wish they made this in a non-energy version.  I enjoy the taste.  Caffeine is barely useful to me as I am extremely resistant to it.  I wouldn't pay 58 dollars for a 24 pack when I can buy them from Wawa for 1.99 a piece.  That would be well under 50 dollars.  This would make the cans around 2.42 a piece.  Multiply the 1.99 by 7% sales tax I pay in New Jersey and I would pay 2.12 a can.  This product is a still great and I think I am going to go out and grab one.
1;"""I had to switch to decaf several years ago due to an ulcer. We recently purchased a Cuisinart kcup brewer. I had been having quite a time finding a great tasting decaf kcup. I ordered a sample pack from another site and it contained one of the Tully's. It was sooo good"
1;I am under strict medical orders to avoid all caffeine and I have been searching for a great decaf for the past few months. I went out on a limb and tried this based on the feedback so far and I am VERY happy with that decision. This really tastes like regular coffee! I even gave a cup to my husband without telling him what it was and he couldn't believe it when I told him that it was decaf. Amazon has the best price around too.
1;This coffee is absolutely wonderful if you like a strong full-bodied coffee that has no bitterness whatsoever and nothing but a wonderful deep coffee flavor. I was very pleasantly surprised the first time I ordered this amazing coffee and I have been buying it ever since. I have never been disappointed. It is truly bold and flavorful and when i serve it to friends they don't have a clue that it is decaf and most can't believe it until I show them the container!
1;This is one of the better decaf brews I have found for the Keurig.  I found others to be bland and leave somewhat of an aftertaste.  One I tried (San Francisco) had very poor packaging with cloth bottom so the coffee would go stale.<br /><br />I highly recommend this (I'll sure order it again).
1;We have purchase Tullys Coffee Decaffeniated KCups from Amazon for over a year and this is the first time we have had this problem. The KCups leak grounds into the cup looks like they were not properly sealed around the edges. What can we do about this? They are very expensive and we had to trow out about half of our order.
1;"""I am a new Keurig owner and this is only the second pack of K-cups I've gotten. I feel like someone finally understands that just because I'm drinking decaf it doesn't mean I don't appreciate a good cup of coffee. And this is an awesome cup of coffee! Strong and dark"
1;Now makes an excellant product and amazon provides it at a very good price with prompt delivery.  The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet.  1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste.  Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later.<br /><br />I have been using this product as a sugar substitute for about a month (replacing aspartame - Equal) and recommend it without reservation.
1;This Stevia is the best we have tried.  We use it in our tea and now we can't stand the taste of real sugar in our tea.  There is no bitter aftertaste like some stevia products we have tried.  I highly recommend Now Stevia.
1;"""I am happy with this product.  I think it would be nice if the flavor was a bit stronger but it still does the job.  Stevia is controversial health wise however so you should really do your reasearch however"
1;"""Excellent product and received in record time...thanks and good job!  Taste is perfect and consistency the same.  The only thing I question is so much plastic is wasted because the container is less than half full each time I've ever received this product.  A container half the size or a slightly larger should be considered"
1;NOW stevia is the best I have used so far. I use it in many things...food and drink. The only way you will get an after taste with this product is if you use too much. It takes very little to sweeten food and drinks.
1;"""I have used the  Now brand stevia for several years now but this improved version is just as good and it dissolves in liquids much easier than the old product. I use this as a sweetner in any drink that needs sugar."""
1;"""I'm so glad I found this 1 pound of NOW stevia.  It is so much cheaper than the little bottles I had been buying for $8/oz.  The packaging is very wasteful--most of it is empty.  Eventually filling my little bottles will get hard unless I transfer the bulk into a smaller container.<br /><br />The taste is fine to me"
1;This is fabulous tasting with no aftertaste at all.  Only takes a bit to sweeten too.  Will be ordering this from now on instead of all the other stevia blends.<br /><br />Highly recommend to everyone.
1;"""Stevia is a healthy alternative to artificial sweetners.  Fast shipping and good service.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028P3CK >Stevia Packets - 1000 - Packets</a> Buying in bulk saves $$$"""
1;"""IN THE PAST I HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH OTHER COMPANIES THAT WOULD REQUIRE A SIGNATURE ON DELIVERY AND IT MADE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE PACKAGE.  BUT AFTER PLACING MY ORDER WITH THE COMPANY THIS TIME"
1;"""I do a lot of grocery shopping at a nearby Fresh and Easy Market. They're a British company and sell a lot of items imported  from England. It's fun to try out new things. One of the new items is a 15-ounce can of Ambrosia Devon Custard.<br /><br />This is good! The label suggest that it's good hot"
1;I live in the UK and buy this custard for my sister-in-law in Arizona as a little present now and again. Why? Well she's crazy about this custard and just cannot get enough of it. I like it too and wonder why there's nothing comparable to it available in the US
1;"""My husband is English and of course misses a lot of grocery items from home.  It's been great lately that Amazon has started to offer so many of these beloved foods. Bought both the Ambrosia Custard and their Rice Pudding. The Custard is the original Ambrosia custard from the UK and very tasty.  If you aren't familiar with it"
1;All hot sauces are not created equal!<br />Pinata hot sauce is packed full of flavor without being abnoxious.<br /><br />Love it on my fish tacos! It is light and carries a lot of punch. If you are looking for a new twist this is it!
1;This stuff is really good.  I add a tablespoon to my normal French roast decaf coffee charge and the coffee gets much richer and better tasting.  Rinas has the best product and price that I have found.
1;We have always loved Vlasic Hot Cauliflower and it is no longer available. This Delallo Hot Cauliflower is every bit as good and is always a big hit at picnics and family dinners. It's unique and delicious. We absolutely LOVE it.
1;"""I have been a beef jerky fan for many years and have tried so many different brands. In the past year I have started making my own due to the prices of beef jerky at most supermarkets. This is one of the best beef jerky's I have had. The consistency is great as is the flavor. Not as sweet as I thought it would be"
1;My kitty can't get enough of 'em. She loves them so much that she does anything to get them. Sometimes she'll stand on her hind legs and meow for several minutes letting me know that she wants them. What enjoyment I get from knowing she loves her treats.
1;My cat loves Temptations and turkey is her favorite.<br />Ordering in quantities from Amazon is a great time and money saver!<br />She also loves the chicken and tuna...she's very particular...I can't sneak in any other flavors but these three.
1;"""We have 5 cats who live outdoor. They come in for 15 mn every evening and I give them treats.<br />They get super excited every time I give them the Whiskas Temptations and not so with the other brands but I keep on alternating the brands to avoid dependency :)<br />By the way"
1;"""My kitties love these treats.  This flavor is a favorite of some of the kitties at the rescue center to which I donate. Other of their kitties like other Temptation flavors .. but they all come running for them. <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029O4RH2 >Whiskas Temptations Seafood Medley Flavour Treats for Cats"
1;My cats second favorite after the dairy flavor. I bought the 12 pack of both flavors and it is nice to have a supply on hand. This is one of my must have items to have at all times at home. I wouldn't want to face my cats if I ran out.
1;My cats love this flavor the best of all the Tempation variety's. They all get into their treat positions around the kitchen when it is treat time. Which is after I have put their breakfast out and made my coffee.
1;Cat treats?  My MinPin (Dog) goes crazy over these!  I've been giving him these little treats for a couple of years along with his dog food...but I think he would give up his dog food for these!! It all started out as an accident..I didn't read the print saying they were for cats.
1;Once I started giving my cats these treats ...I just have to touch the bag and where ever my cats are their super hearing picks up the 'bag noise' and everyone comes running. Definitely<br />better than other treats I have tried.
1;"""I have 2 cats and they are basically addicted to this stuff.  The minute I so much as pick up the bag they come running from whereever they are.  Even if you just say  yellow bag  the little ears perk up and they are ready to pounce.  Don't have any idea what makes them so irresistable but they obviously are.  I know other people who have had the same experience with their cats.  Too bad chocolate doesn't have 2 calories per piece like this does."""
1;"""These are the only treats my wife's cats eats.  Give them anything else the dogs end up eating them.  Its funny because they like them so much they have learned to beg for them.  You can't lose with these treats"
1;"""We have two cats.  One is a large black Bombay 4 years old.  The other a Teal Tabby 2 years old.  We love our kitties.  They are our family.  We tried every cat treat we could find and many large animal supply (and small) chain stores and neither Chester or Pumpkin would have anything to do with them except turn up their nose and walk away.  Then we came on  Temptations .  Now"
1;My cat LOVES these treats. If I forget to give a few out before I get into bed my guy makes sure I do not get to close my eyes!<br />I have tried other flavors and brands but these are a sure bet. Decent price too
1;My four cats adore this.  They split one bag every night.  I mistakenly gave some  to a stray cat that I feed and he would not leave the deck until I gave him a whole bag.  My mother's cat is also addicted and requires a hand full every day.  She stares pointedly between my mother and her food bowl until she gets enough.<br /><br />Since one my cats has some dental problems this cat food is great as a treat that is good for them.
1;"""My cat absolutely loves all of the temptation flavors but I feel like he is getting oral care when I add these to the mix.  I get my amazon products on time and in fine condition.  Subscribe & Save is a great program"
1;"""The title says it all! I even buy these on a subscription as I save money over the store price (even Walmart) and get free shipping. (I never want to run out of these are I don't want my fur-kids giving 'dirty looks').  I recommend this to anyone who wants a good kitty treat that is also a hairball product.  After you cats gets a taste of these"
1;"""I've been giving my cat medication for a little over a year now and I just hate prying open his mouth and dropping the pill in.  If I get one of these treats ready beforehand it triggers his attention to the treat instead of the pill.  I give him his medication and then immediately give him the treat.  (not in the same fashion"
1;"""Our cats are definitely tempted by Temptations!  I was delighted to find that Temptations had come out in a  Greenie  dentable form.  All five of our kitties love them and they are like  crack  for cats.  The Whiskas Temptations line of treats are a favorite among our felines.<br /><br />Love to see my cats run around and chase these things!  Stuffed delights for them!  Cats love 'em and they are supposed to provide good dental hygiene for them."""
1;"""I am sorry but the below reviewer is absolutely talking non-scence. I have 7 cats and 8 bags of these in my cabinets but I have gone days on end without giving these to ANY of my cats and they are absolutely fine. Also I run a shelter with a LOT of cats and have not had them acted like she sais.<br /><br />These cat treats have the ingredients on the label and just like any cat treat cats love them... My cats also love Party Mix"
1;I have three rescued cats and feed them regular food of course but when they want a treat they will only eat the Whiskas Savory Salmon. I have tried more expensive treats and pretty near every type and brand. They will only come for Whiskas Savory Salmon.  They rate it a five star treat!
1;"""My cat  Sweet Kitty  is an indoor rescue cat that has leukemia and therefore is a bit funny with what she likes to eat.<br />This Savory Salmon Flavour is her treat/lunch most every day and she loves it.  I have tried other flavors of the Temptations with her and her internal system rejects them.<br />So thank you and a meow from her.<br /><br />Susan"""
1;My cat loves these treats.  Her name is Precious and this is one of her favorite treats.  I did not buy mine from Amazon but got them from Walmart instead.  She has tried some of the other flavors of Whiskas Temptations as well and loves those as well.  She always gobbles these down real quick.  I am thinking about trying her on the tuna flavor next since she loves tuna so much.
1;These do seem to cut down on hair balls and our 2 cats devour them.  We use a little less than recommended since they seem to cause runny stools.  The auto-ship program is great and the cost is less than purchasing them at the local store.
1;"""These are the only brand of treats my cat will eat. She loves them! Prior to finding them on Amazon I would get them at local stores but it is so much cheaper to buy them through Amazon.<br />I always give my cat 4 or 5 treats every night before bed and sometimes during the day"
1;"""My cat goes craaaazy over these treats!  Every time I shake the plastic container I put them in or open the lid she comes running and meowing.  She loves them so much I've been able to teach her tricks using these.  She can sit"
1;"""So i would get china breakfast tea almost every other day at a local coffee shop. needless to say it started getting expensive so i was very excited to find it online. The price i paid online for 4 tins is about how much i'd spend in 2 weeks at the shop. So not only am i saving money but i get the delicious deep flavored tea whenever i feel like it. This is the best tea ever. Its perfect for those who used to drink coffee and like deep flavors"
1;I'm new to the world of tea brews and I'm not so discerning towards the beverage to be able to dissect specific flavor notes but this is a wonderful full flavored tea.  It is as close as I've found thus far to just a simple tea and I very much enjoy it milk and sugar free.
1;"""As I am writing this I can see these seeds growing. Just kidding but it has been 4 days and each and every seed has sprouted and is over an inch tall. I cannot believe how fast these are growing. I am looking forward to juicing these seeds. I have 2 15x9 plastic containers sitting next to my <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016NUZP0 >AeroGrow AeroGarden Pro 200 with Master Gardener 1-Season Kit and Gourmet Herb Seed Kit</a>. The light from this bleeds over onto the wheatgrass seeds. I dont know if its the lights"
1;"""The quality of these seeds is excellent. They begin to germinate for me in 24 hours and in 3 to 5 days they are ready to use. I've never sprouted seeds with results as good as this. I can easily recommend these to the sprouter"
1;Im growing wheatgrass to juice and so far these seeds are growing FAST! every step has been shorter then expected. Well packaged! each bag was the correct amount that i use for one tray. :)<br />Each tiny seed is taking off..if i drop one while planting i make sure to find it! lol these seeds are alive!<br />definitely will order from again..which will be after i run out hahaha
1;"""I bought these to give wheatgrass a try. They sprouted VERY fast and are now growing in a tray. I used a couple of drops of hydrogen peroxide in the water while germinating. I am very happy with my purchase"
1;We just bought a grain mill and using these grains to mill was a breeze and so delicious.  Our first loaf of bread made with these grains freshly milled was incredible.  I had no idea what the difference in taste might be like.  The grains were timely shipped and arrived clean and neatly packaged.  Highly recommended for good taste and health.
1;"""I have found that a large patio tub planted with wheat grass keeps my cats away from attacking my house plants.  These seeds are far superior to the ones I was buying in my local pet store.  They sprouted within two days with the lushest"
1;I planted this wheat about 6 days ago in a raised bed garden and it's already 1 1/2 inches tall!<br /><br />I also sprouted this wheat in a sprout jar and it was very productive.<br /><br />So I'm happy with my purchase!
1;Very happy with everything about this product and company.  My first order arrived the end of July and I have been sprouting about 1 flat a week for my chickens with great success...and most of all they love the wheat grass!  I really appreciated the no fuss packaging which I am sure helps keep our costs down and is better for the environment.  I will be ordering this product from this company over and over.  I appreciated the fast response to my order and the no shipping fees!!  I thank you for your super service and my girls thank you too!
1;"""I plant this in pots and use it as cat grass.  (Never tried eating it myself.)  They LOVE it.  It's so much cheaper doing this than buying  cat grass  and it's more reliable and easy to grow.  My cats (and dogs sometimes) love to snack on it a little bit to aid in digestion.  It also looks VERY nice and I can see why people might grow it just for decoration."""
1;"""One of the best detoxification actions you can do for yourself is drinking fresh wheat grass juice. It's been called  liquid sunshine .  And growing and juicing for yourself is so much easier and cost effective than going to the juice bar.  Yes"
1;My seeds arrived 3 days after ordering and I immediately began germinating to grow a few nice patches of grass. Almost all of the seeds sprouted and easily grew in soil. I had left them in the container too long and the roots tangled bad and got ripped but they're pretty tough and still grew. The patches also came out real green and thick. I will keep buying them from here!
1;I ordered these seeds to grow wheat grass for decorations at my wedding.  During my test grow I planted seeds in pots on a Thursday and by Monday they were an inch or so high!  They are pretty hearty and look great for decoration.  Can't wait to grow more for my wedding!
1;Takes a few days to kick in but then it started growing like wildfire. A week from from germinating it we had full grown wheatgrass ready to be cultivated. Almost too much for our little pot to handle. Never really got a chance to juice it or drink it so can't comment on that part of it. Started growing in all different directions and overflowing the pot because we didn't cut any of it off for juicing.<br /><br />Still have a bunch of seeds left and maybe will plant more another time so I can make a comment on it more.
1;The Numi organic tea chest was a wonderful experience in tasting tea. I loved all of the flavors except one.  This is a wonderful way to try before you buy a larger box or it would make a great gift because there are so many choices in this box and the box itself is reusable. I have tried many brands of tea and this one is the one I enjoyed the most in a variety pack. I really enjoy the fact that it is organic and that I can get the flavors I really enjoy in larger boxes. Thanks to Numi for making any part of the day flavorful and healthy.
1;Great food.  Healthy.  My two cats really eat this stuff up like there's no tomorrow.<br /><br />My one cat started chewing the bag to get to it. It's not like my cats don't get feed<br />they do and are never starving. Both my cats are 17-19 lbs.so you know they eat! lol<br /><br />I would reccomend this food for your cat. Excellent Natural Indgedients.<br /><br />Worth the price.
1;i used to drink the dieters green often but i read that the senna in it is not good to consume that frequently so i reduced my intake. the dieters green made my tummy hurt just a little when i started to drink it but later it didn't bother me so much.<br /><br />i actually ordered this dieter's green but the seller gave me the super slimming one instead. i was pretty bummed at first but figured i'd give it a try. it ended up being a blessing in disguise. the slimming one is sort of the same as the dieter's green but it didn't really make my tummy hurt like the dieters green so i really love it.
1;When I first tasted this drink my taste buds were having a party. It is the best Ginger ale I have ever tasted. The store I normally purchase it from is always sold out. Finding it on amazon was a dream come true!
1;"""I've tried so many ginger ales over and over again for high balls.  What's a high ball?  It's a drink with ginger ale or soda.  Ginger ale is usually better than soda in a high ball.  Boylan's is better than any other ginger ale for a high ball or any other mixed drink.  It is not even close.  Bourbon high ball"
1;I used these to icing cookies.  They were a nice alternative to regular icing.  I found it to be slightly less sweet than confectioners sugar.  I dipped the cookies in the yogurt and the icing great flavor.
1;I drink this daily - I mix it with a regular green tea that I brew all night and then make ice tea in the morning.  This tea is perfect for ice tea.  My sister says that it is the only tea that soothes her sore throat when she is sick.  This tea definitely has a unique flavor -you will either love it or hate it.  I love it.  I also love all the health benefits of Kombucha.  This will be a tea that I drink for the rest of my life!
1;A great tasting alkaline decaf tea which should be used by everybody that suffers from acid reflux or GERD. I use one bag and make a pot in my Cuisinart coffee pot.<br /><br />Get off the coffee and caffeine kick and get well.
1;"""I'm never without this mild-flavored tea.  It is much more enjoyable than plain green tea (which I don't care for).  Everyone I serve it to is surprised by the pleasant flavor - several buy it themselves"
1;"""Tis decafinated tea is good tasting and makes my digestive system works very well.  I enjoy it the evening when all meals are finished and I can relax with a good book by Nora Roberts/J.D.Robb.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014D71O >Green Tea Kombucha Tea 16 Bags</a>"""
1;"""I have IBS with constipation issues. I drink this everyday and it helps me use the bathroom properly and makes the bowels and tummy feel better without the jitteriness of caffeinated green tea. I cannot live without it! I was so glad to find it here on Amazon in a 6 pack case. I had been buying it at Whole Foods for more than double the price! As long as Amazon keeps selling it"
1;"""I tried this tea around last October (2011) and fell in love with it's taste and the way it made me feel.<br />I've been drinking it daily or at least 4 times a week for 8 months.<br />It tastes fresh"
1;Organic and provides protection against unwanted bacterial growth... I just place some on my daily dinner for its benefits but it never tastes or smells like the fresh ones that I get from my garden. Basil is not an easy plant to deal with except during summer so this is the best that I have got so far. Bravo.
1;"""My reaction was  wow!  the first time I gave these to my 8 year old lab.  His teeth were extremely dirty with what seemed like plaque or whatever it was on his teeth that I could not get rid of by brushing his teeth.  I thought I would need the vet to professionally clean his teeth.  I was amazed as to how his teeth became pearly white after a few of these greenies not to mention that his breath did not have a nasty smell either.  I give these to my 2 year old pup as well.  Her teeth have never been as dirty as my 8 year old's but at least her breath is fresher too.<br /><br />5 STARS ALL THE WAY!"""
1;Good dog biscuit.  It is the treat she gets when we have to leave her home alone for a little while.  She knows a Greenie means we are going and will be back soon.  She takes it to her favorite mat and doesn't seem to mind that we are leaving.  I feel it is better quality than a lot of dog treats.
1;It arrived fast and it was priced really good. This is the first time I've tried them but my friends dog has used them since she was a pup and her teeth are so white and healthy! Can't wait till my puppy gets older and I see how good they worked.
1;"""About four years ago I went on a Bloody Mary rampage.  I was determined to find the best and boy did I.  I tried bloody mary's from every where.  Homemade to bar to fine dinning restaurants.  I even bought numerous books on the subject and ordered every premix I could find. I finally ran across this mix at a small beer brewer in St Augustine"
1;I first feel in love with these when I visited Holland. Trader Joe's has a smaller version but I like the bigger ones best. If you put it on top of a cup of tea the center gets all gooey and delicious. It is very hard for me to eat just one of these. I recommend them to EVERYONE!!!<br />- Laura
1;I discovered Stroopwafels on one of my visits to Amsterdam and fell in love with them.  It's been 6 years since I've been there and I haven't had once since.  At least until today when my shipment of these Stroopwafels came.  They are as delicious as I remember them being in Amsterdam.  Place one on top a hot cup of tea for a few minutes and you're going to be in for a real treat.<br /><br />I can honestly say these are indeed authentic.  Grab em while you can!
1;These spice mixes rock. The dish turns out perfectly if you follow the simple directions. I tend to experiment by lowering oil content and it still tastes great. The Rajma and the Okra Bhindi Masala taste fabulous. The only downside is the rather expensive price tag.
1;Love the taste and it's only 110 calories and the market nearby stopped carrying it.  Flavored oatmeal doesn't get any lower in calories and with the subscribe and save it's just 37 cents a packet.  Love this stuff.
1;This stuff tastes great!  Much larger chunks of apples than in other versions.  Haven't been able to find this outside a variety pack...please let me know when it's available in one-flavor boxes!!  Thanks!!
1;"""My wife says that I can cook two things - omelettes and popcorn...with popcorn being my best. We have always used popcorn from the grocery store but the Amish Country Lady Finger Popcorn is so far superior to the store bought. The flavor was so good you did not have to use butter and it was a delight to eat"
1;"""Even  no hull  popcorn has hulls.  It has to so it can contain the moisture in the kernel and cause the popcorn to POP.   No hull  popcorn has a hull that shatters when the popcorn pops so the hull isn't as noticeable.  There's no guarantee that every hull will shatter into  invisible  pieces.  So ALL popcorn varieties have a hull.  With some varieties you just don't notice it as much."""
1;"""Amish Country Lady Finger popcorn is not hull free but we had to search to find any!  This product arrived quickly and well packaged.  It is crisp with a mild flavor everyone seemed to enjoy. Anyone with dentures will appreciate this product"
1;I buy Dogwell chicken treats for my dogs all the time.  These are the best chicken treats I have found for my dogs.  They love them and would eat the entire bag in one siting if they could.  I always buy these from Amazon.
1;"""I bought this item for the first time in Santa Cruz while visiting a friend there.  When I returned to the bay area I looked in every store I could for it and found it at one quite a distance from my home. I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  I buy the pack of 6 and go through it in a month. Its all I want for breakfast... not oatmeal or eggs for me anymore.  That's why I say"
1;"""I've ordered the sample six-pack and figured I'd have granola for a very long time. Wrong.  My husband started eating it for a late night snack and then started eating it for breakfast - and I was lucky to get a couple of bowls for myself.<br /><br />We like all the flavors"
1;"""We have had an ongoing gopher problem in our yard since we neighbor a large hillside. Our nicely landscaped yard and moist soil is a buffet for gophers.<br /><br />We have tried the following with a mediocre success rate:<br /><br />1) Ultrasonic repellants (battery or solar powered stakes) - This may keep them from creating a burrow under your yard"
1;Have caught several prairie gophers with these.  Easier and more effective than steel traps.  Was taught to avoid placing any unfamiliar odor at the site.  I rub fresh dirt from the site into gloves and traps.  File the wire ends that hold the trigger plate at a slight angle with a fine file so it trips easily.  I close the hole with small stakes and pieces of dirt and then fine dirt to close completely off.  If I don't keep the light and fresh air out they will fill the traps with packed dirt. If the run is active<br />I'll catch one in a few hours.
1;"""I have had gophers in my back yard garden for 3 years now. I have tried various chemical options including pepper and dried blood and the gophers show up each year. They recently started a massive expansion campaign"
1;tHIS POWERFUL FRUIT HAS 2 TIMES THE ANTI-OXIDANT OF BLUEBERRIES. SUN-MAID MALE QUALITY PRODUCTS AND THESE PRUNES ARE SO PLUMP AND JUICY A DELICIOUS TREAT BY THEM SELVES OR USED WITH OTHER FAVORITE FOODS. YES THESE ARE GOOD IF YOUR CONSTIPATED BUT THEY DO SO MUCH MORE. TYPE IN BENEFITS OF PRUNES IN YOUR SEARCH ENGINE AND BE AMAZED. DR. OZ ALSO LIKES THEM.
1;I was on the search for a chai that had enough 'zing' to it after being dissapointed countless times by starbucks chai. This spicy ginger chai is perfect -- not too sweet and a great amount of spice.  Chai is my favorite winter drink and Im about to order a couple more cases of this stuff to keep stocked up for winter.
1;This was given as a gift to a friend of mine who showed wonderful hospitality during a recent trip I took. He loves coffee and enjoys chocolate and the result was a very happy person. They loved the combination of coffee and chocolate and I now think Ive got some one addicted!
1;"""I usually treat myself to the  star  or  caribou  chocolate coffee beans every now and then but at $3 for an ounce or two wasn't very often..then came across these on Amazon...it seems you can buy ANYTHING on Amazon! so I read the reviews and bought them...received a whole pound! which lasted me a month and......tastes just as good as the others in coffee shops! Sure it costs about the same for shipping as the product/but it would cost me $3 in gas for the truck to run up to the coffee shop and back....and instead of only a few ounces you can get a whole pound! since I discovered I could order these online last summer/ I had ordered 4 times already! and plan to order more in a few weeks...YUM!!!!"""
1;I could only find these at SuperWalmart which is about 45 min driving time. I was so happy to find them here at Amazon AND free shipping. I LOVE these Chex. Great price delivered to my door. Thanks Amazon!
1;Wonderful to find item unable to locate in any store.  I fell in love with these first time I tried them and searched for a long time before finding them on Amazon.  Great for my diet and gives me the satisfaction of something sweet.  Hope they never quit offering.
1;"""I'm a  crunch-A-holic and this product really fills the bill. The combination of a slight dark chocolate taste and the amazing caramel taste is GREAT! Plus it's only 100 calories a pouch! You can't beat that!"""
1;A great combination of crunchy and chocolate in a serving size that won't sabotage your waistline.  Having a whole case means you are not constantly having to get more. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition.
1;We have these out in the reception area of my business.  Had a hard time finding them at a reasonable price. This was the best for the money. Sam's quit carrying them and the substitute wasn't acceptable so was glad to find the Starlights again.
1;"""My grandma got me hooked on this stuff. It has a wonderful raspberry flavor that can't be duplicated and is so creamy! I would recommend this to anybody! I am so happy I found this product on Amazon.com because it is so hard to find"
1;"""I love to wake up with the smell and taste of Barnie's Cool Cafe Blues Gourmet coffee. It really gives me a kick start for both my personal or business world. This is one flavor that you can either drink hot or cold"
1;I have had one of these plants for years. The only plant I've managed not to kill. So I ordered a small one for a friend who also has a black thumb. This little guy was shipped during a horrible heat wave and arrived in beautiful condition. It was really well packed and shipped very fast. The price is just terrific for such a great little plant. Highly recommend seller.
1;"""I was looking at the home depot for money trees.  I checked back three separate times.  They did not have them.  So I looked on line.  I was suspect of the trees arriving and being alive.  But they came promptly"
1;"""I ordered two of these money tree plants for 5.57 each plus Shipping. They arrived in very good condition . Each having a very good number of leaves and very healthy  . The pot is encased in a plastic bag and rubber banded to the base of the plant . As it is shipped when they are dry  I watered mine as soon as I could.  I am going to transfer to a larger "
1;"""The plant arrived promptly in excellent condition.  It is very healthy and sturdy looking.  Better than the picture.  I have a plant similar to this one that lasted 10 years until someone told me to put it in the sunlight--wrong move.  This one came with directions for in-direct sunlight.  I have had it for a couple weeks"
1;THANK YOU SOO MUCH I ordered this for my 69 year old grama in ohio who is diabetic and at risk of loosing a limb or more then that even and the money trees were to cheer her up and they did just that I just wanted to thank you whoever you are for helping me to send something alive thriving and healthy to my grandmother It was WONDERFUL!!!!
1;I love the taste of Pour Over Movie Theater Butter Popcorn from Orville Redenbacher. I have found it tough to find in my local grocery stores so it's nice to be able to find it on Amazon. It always arrives in a timely fashion and in good shape. Please don't ever run out of it.
1;"""I had a difficult time finding the sanding sugar.  There are no stores in my area that carry it.  I was very surprised to find it on Amazon.  The store I bought it from was quick to deliver and I was very pleased with the price of the product.  I received a generous amount and was able to  dust  all my sugar cookies! Thank you!"""
1;I am sad that this product is being discontinued in the stores but I am glad that I was able to find it at your site.  Thank you for fast shipping.  One box was slightly damaged but the inner bag was intact so no problem there.  Thanks again.
1;They sell Count Chocula at Target during Halloween (along with Boo Berry and Franken Berry) and so I finally got have it again after all these years of craving it. I remember it being a big hit in the early 90's and the taste sure brings back memories. It's easily the most delicious cereal ever!<br />I'm glad they didn't discontinue it completely and that it's available online. I just wish it were more readily available at my local grocery store. Gotta love those chocolately marshmallows!
1;I don't really eat breakfast cereal so this review is on behalf of my husband. This is his favorite cereal. Why is this cereal only available for Halloween? I purchased 20 boxes back in October and by Thanksgiving they were all gone. So we now have to wait until next October to purchase them again or get them online. Can someone from General Mills explain the reasoning behind this?
1;"""I bought this for my boyfriend as his  funny  Christmas present. It is his favorite cereal. He absolutely LOVED it. He dared the kids to eat it. :) I ordered the product and was not sure that it would make it in time"
1;This cereal is very hard to find and after doing a little research I found out that it is a seasonal cereal and is only produced in the fall around Halloween. No stores where I live carry it so amazon is a great way to find items that my area stores will not carry. This cereal is exactly as I remembered and worth the effort to locate.  There is no other cereal that can come close to it.
1;Couldn't wait until the fall when the local stores restock their shelves with Count Chocula cereal.  It's the only cereal that I will eat.  I split the order with my younger sister who also loves Count Chocula and is disappointed with the limited supply.  I'm sure we'll be putting in a few more orders which should last us until this coming Halloween.<br /><br />We will be sure to stock up next time!
1;"""We received a bag of these yesterday in a snack gift box sent by my sis in law.<br />I tasted them and they are quite good!  I looked at the ingredients and realized there isn't any actual cheese in them so I figured the nutritional yeast had something to do with the flavor.  I confirmed this after googling  nutritional yeast  and also found that it has a good amount of nutritional value"
1;These are so tasty and addictive! I wish I could buy 10 lb. bags. They have a yummy cheesy flavor due to the combination of pureed cashews/red bell pepper. So delicious - you can't go wrong with these as a savory snack. Use them to convert your friends to the world of kale chips! Then try making your own.
1;I finally received my shipment of the Espressivo.  I had tried this and went to order it for myself for use with my Citiz machine and I am really pleased all the way around - both the crema and the flavor are excellent. I plan on trying some of the other flavors down the road but really am enjoying the Espressivo. Ethical Coffee Company has a new customer. besides the shipping taking a little longer than expected I think this is great.
1;I purchased the Ethical Coffee Capsules this week to try on my Nespresso Lattissima that I purchased from Sur La Table-which did not sell Nespresso capsules-Strange.<br />I picked the ECC Espressivo for its strong intensity rating as I like a strong espresso.  I popped the first capsule into the machine and pulled down the lever and heard the pop of the capsule and soon smelled a very pleasant aroma that immediately reminded me of the Italian coffee shops of Milan.  THe Espressivo had a very strong taste and a smooth finish and gave me just the right lift I was looking for.  I then had a latte the next day and the combination of milk & crema was perfect- I am sold.  The convenience of getting the capsules delivered right to our door (free of charge) is brilliant along with the whole biodegradable capsule which my wife said she would put into our garden is a nice feeling.  I have already ordered the other flavors.<br /><br />Coffee guy!
1;We purchased two of the ice tea dispensers for use at various church functions.  They were light weight and easy to handle. Clean up was also much easier than the expensive heavy duty dispensers.  Great quality for the price.
1;We use taco type seasoning quite a bit and it seemed I was always running out and replacing those little jars.<br />This mix has good flavor and assures that I'll have it on hand for quite awhile.  Very handy.
1;"""This is a GREAT tasting and HEALTHY cereal which I enjoy for my breakfast almost every day of the week. Kudos to to Nature's Path for producing a cereal that tastes good and really is healthy! Almost all other cereals including so-called  healthy  high fiber ones have HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP as one of the principle ingrediants.<br /><br />HFCS is suspected of contributing to metabolism disorders"
1;I am a middle aged women and for the past ten years have had what is called Irritable bowel syndrome.  I have been to Drs and have tryed all kinds of medications.  I have been eating this cereal almost five days a week for the past five years and I no longer have bowel issues.  It has made me regular and no more constipation or bloating.
1;"""This is a cereal I found while on vacation in Seattle but can't find locally. I order it on Amazon in a package of 6 boxes and it is cheaper than it would be at a health food store. I am in my 60's and fiber is my friend and sugar is not! This cereal is high-fiber and low sugar"
1;"""I am not a big fan of bran cereals. Most of them are heavy and get soggy fast in milk. Smart Bran was a pleasant surprise. I love the light texture that is in between bran buds and rice crispies. They are impervious to milk and remain appealing to eat to the last spoonful. The taste is also amazing. There isn't that gritty feeling that most bran cereals leave behind.<br /><br />One criticism is that the sweetness"
1;I had been eating Kelloggs Bran Buds which were fine except they contained a few unfavorable ingredients (HFCS being one of them!).  I went looking for the organic approach in a similar product and found Smart Bran by Nature's Path.  I enjoy it equally well and feel that I am getting a superior product because of the organic and wholesome ingredients.  I am grateful it is being offered undert the S&S program so it is at a very favorable price compared to the per box price in a grocery store (plus it's difficult to even FIND this product at a lot of stores!).  This cereal fills me ups and seems to keep my digestion process funtioning well.  I like it with greek yogurt and fresh fruit.  The serving size is really more than adequate (don't fill up your cereal bowl!).  A good choice if you are looking for a bran cereal.
1;"""<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL3DM >Nature's Path Organic Smart Bran Cereal Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br />I actually love this cereal so much I signed up for automatic delivery.  It is not artificially sweetend and does not become mushy sawdust as you eat it....stays crunchy."""
1;Picked up a teeny bag in a local dollar store and have been on the hunt for them ever since. I am so glad Amazon carries them! They have the same sweet/salty thing going on as fresh kettle corn does-but with the caramel taste. There are 'lumps' of hardened caramel goodness on the chips(like the caramelized sugar/butter chunks you yearn for in kettle corn). Can't wait to get them. Thanks Amazon!
1;I hadn't seen these in years. Bought a bag at the grocery store and got addicted to them all over again. Went back to get more and they were out of stock - for 3 weeks. I am so happy to find them on Amazon.
1;"""I've tried several other brands of low-carb breads and they were flavorless with an odd texture.  Carb Krunchers breads  are great - they freeze well and hold up well in the freezer (don't become soggy when they thaw).  They toast very well.  You could serve these to unsuspecting people and they wouldn't know the difference.  Not the BEST bagel I've ever had"
1;We've been drinking this coffee for several months and love the flavor and the fact that it's organic. Buying 3 bags at a time is no problem as we throw the extras in the freezer till it's time to open a fresh bag. We purchased some other whole bean organic coffees elsewhere on the Internet at much higher prices and the shipping was quite expensive. Amazon sells this at a great price and it qualifies for free shipping making it cheaper than buying the typical run of the mill coffee from the grocery store. Try it and see for yourself.
1;My girls loved this although it did take getting used to the texture.  The texture is thicker and chunkier than other stage three foods and is perfect for transitioning to solids.  I fed them this until they were 15 months old.  Now they are 19 months old and from time to time somebody still goes in the cabinet and brings me a jar to feed them.  Better than I expected!
1;This is basically mashed up pasta with carrots and I guess pureed chicken. Some jars seem to be chunkier than others... My daughter really enjoys it. I got some broken jars once and Amazon was great with their customer service. Highly recommend.
1;I am addicted to these things! They are difficult to find in my local grocery store and my Sams Club doesn't always carry them. I have bought these and the Kellog's variety. I prefer these because the flavor is more robust and the texture is more like Gummi Bears while the Kellogs is more soft & smooth and the flavor is a bit flat. I like to grab a couple bags on my way up to bed as a bedtime snack.<br /><br />[...]
1;"""I first bought these to have on hand in case of an emergency. It is a plain and simple fish perfect for adding to a simple soup or salad. I personally like having the low sodium so I can add the amount of sea salt I like"
1;"""I have always loved this product and was glad to subscribe so that I could have a constant supply on hand.  The smoky flavor and the lower salt content are very tasty.  The supplier keeps juggling the price and sometimes it's not available"
1;I really like Crown Prince seafood - it is high quality.  There is certainly a difference than the store brands and not just the hefty price.  My son (8 year old) loves these snacks with avocados I do too.  It's nice to have a healthy quick snack on the go.
1;"""I recently began baking Red Velvet cakes and was surprised at the cost and difficulty of locating and buying single bottles of red food coloring for the cakes.  These cakes take two TABLESPOONS of food coloring per batch and when the batch is doubled"
1;My red velvet cake recipe was costing me about 8 dollars a cake in red food coloring.  Things were getting out of hand fast.  This is saving me a ton of money.  A great way to buy food coloring.<br /><br />The product itself gives a beautiful color and doesn't seem to impart any additional flavor.
1;"""I bought this for my grandson last Christmas as a  gag  Christmas gift because he LOVES these candy bars and was always asking someone to buy him some everytime anyone went to the store.  He really loved this gift although I'm not too sure his parents did because of the  sugar  high (he kept them in his bedroom for late night snacks!).  His pleasure was well worth the price of the candy. He's 16"
1;This was so hard to find for a little over a year. I tried various other cocoa powders and finally found a Starbucks hot chocolate individual packets last year that ended up being a decent alternative but nothing compares to their mocha powder!! It makes the best mochas at home! It's still not exactly like getting a mocha directly from Starbucks but it is definitely the next best thing. I LOVE IT!!
1;I am so glad they brought the mocha powder back. Know I can duplicate them at home while saving money. The mocha's taste great when making them with the mocha powder! Hopefully it won't disappear again!
1;I had been waiting and hoping for Starbucks Mocha Powder to be available again after disappearing from the shelves at the Starbucks coffee shops. It tastes just like I remember and it came promptly after I ordered it -- I ordered 2 cans to make sure I have it on hand for awhile. Thank you for carrying this well loved and missed product.
1;I LOVE this product!!! Our dog and cats are crazy about it and it is good for them.  NO additives!!! Only dehydrated beef livers!  You do have to be careful because too many will cause diarrhea but I cut them small (when necessary) for my 8 lb Papillon and he can have quite a few before having any problem.  It does smell like liver so you won't want to carry them in your pocket without putting them in a plastic baggy.  Excellent for training!!!
1;I was first introduced to Bakery on Main at a local GF Food Fair. I am still in the learning stages of finding out more about being GF but I have a 2 year old that is Gluten Intolerant and I needed to find a snack food I could trust for her to eat. At the food fair we tested soem products and she loved them! I find myself and my 4 year old even eating these bars. They are the perfect mix of sweet and savory with the cranberries.
1;I love craisins and was so pleased with the taste of Bakery On Main granola bars. I've had some other gluten-free bars from other brands that I didn't like at all and so I was a bit hesitant to try any more gluten-free bars. Glad that I took a chance and tried Bakery On Main. I love all their products.
1;"""I love these bars!  I really can't believe that they are gluten free.  I truely would not be successful without having all of the Bakery On Main products that are available to me.  Some gluten free items just don't taste good"
1;These are wonderful. They have packed with cranberries and taste great with mixed in the maple nut. They are great to have on those busy morning when you don't have time for breakfast or you are just on the run. They tie you over till lunch and you know you gave yourself something good.
1;I bought these for a relative who cannot eat gluten and she told me she loved them.  I'm glad Amazon has so many gluten free products to choose from.  I choose these because of the rave reviews and I guess they were right because she loved them!
1;Bakery On Main Cranberry GF Maple Nut Bars are a welcome addition to my GF pantry. They are easy to take along while running errands or road trips. There is always one or more in my purse. They are a tasty snack.
1;"""This stuff is the best mix and I love everything in it.  Usually stuff gets picked around but not in this batch.  I can't believe they only put the big bags & containers out in stores at xmas time though"
1;"""The Ginger chews by the Ginger People are my favorite candies of all time! These are the Ginger People's pure Ginger candies and they are of excellent quality. They are perfect if you like really spicy candies. These candies are similar to the  See's  brand Crystallized Ginger and I feel that the quality is about the same as  See's . Unlike the See's brand"
1;"""The other five-star reviews have said it all.  This is an absolutely fabulous product.  I just want to emphasize that it is also very good if you have an upset stomach.  I suffer from chronic stomach issues"
1;This is the best Ginger I have ever had.  This is the 2nd time I bought from Amazon.  I buy it in a local store but in the spring of 2011 they had none so I searched on line and found it here.  We are all hooked!  I have an 89 year old Aunt that has vertigo and it helps her a lot.  We also take it for  stomach issues and colds.  Only the Ginger People's Crystallized Ginger from now on.
1;"""I have a lab that absolutely loves these.  I buy the 6-pack of small dog peanut butter since they're small enough to fit in a Kong and fill it up.  She loves them so much in fact that she'll bring the Kong over to me"
1;My dogs love these treats.  I use them for treats as well as training.  They are small enough so you do not have to worry about your dog gaining weight if you use them often.  I have used them exclusively to potty train my Basset Hounds.
1;"""Cats really love this food and I recommend it to anyone I know with a cat who throws up a lot. Many times they will stop throwing up altogether after being put on this food. It is great for sensitive tummies. I like the fact that this comes in multiple smaller pouches so that it stays extra fresh and is easier to handle. I have back and joint problems and I just can't handle large bags of food so I am willing to pay extra for the convenience. Plus"
1;This pasta stays al dente much more than other brands I have tried.  I am so impressed that I am going to make a point of looking for this particular brand from now on.  Bulk shopping clubs sell this for $7 per 9 boxes.
1;"""I started buying Avoderm for a cat with a skin problem. She kept licking the fur off her tummy. Nothing worked - even those high-powered pricey foods from the vet.<br /><br />Then we discovered Avoderm and now it's my primary food of choice for all three of my companion animals. My dog (the CanineUrbanPrincess) had minor skin issues when I adopted her. She kept scratching. After I switched her food to Avoderm (mixed with some California Natural)"
1;This organic whole grain cereal is not only healthy but also delicious.  10% of profits support community projects for peace.  Nothing synthetic or artificial has been added.  I particularly love the mango flavor!
1;"""Yes it is expensive. But it has best of both worlds. Peace has great taste particularly mango peach passion. Not really excessive sugar unless you are coming from blend organic brand. The ingredients are also very good (although not organic). It has real fruit chunks. It is definitely worth to try even at this price. I usually but it at papa joes. michigan"
1;I bought this bag of Ghost peppers and they were great! I made a awesome hot sauce with them and crushed the rest up for soups and such. Only thing I can say is that the quality of the peppers varied quite a bit. Some were small and unripe but overall it did not affect my opinion of the seller as I'd prefer that those peppers weren't thrown away because they were unripe. Hope this helps. I will be buying the this seller again.
1;this coffee drink is great! it will wake you up and tastes delicious-you will want to drink 2 cans.<br />I could only find it in some 7-11's but amazon's price and free shipping are the better deal. ENJOY.<br />I will continue to buy from amazon.
1;"""<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053HNTUS >1 Gallon Snappy Buttery Canola Oil</a> Has been a very good popcorn.  It is like having the movie theater type popcorn.  Very light and fluffy with a buttery taste and where i can have 1 batch of popcorn "
1;"""i bought this as a gag gift mostly.  i like metal music so i thought it would be a fun thing to have on the shelf.  but this hot Sauce tastes GREAT!  I'm now buying it for every metalhead i know that likes spicy food.  its fantastic.  I'm about to order all the other ones now.<br /><br />it is not extremely hot"
1;"""I am Canadian and was raised drinking hot tea. We didn't even know what iced tea was. I live in Virginia now and iced tea is the norm. I have searched for good tea for hot tea and have been disappointed in not finding tea like I remembered growing up. Taking a risk"
1;Omg thus stuff was decadent. I mean really couldn't put it down. I'm not Greek or middle eastern in any way and have never tried the really authentic stuff but man I can only say that this is probably the best baklava type pastry ive ever had. Try their other varieties as well. All I can say is brew a pot of coffee and enjoy. It is really great stuff. They also have sugar free varieties.
1;"""I discovered Chimes Ginger Chews a few months ago and I am hooked!  I have also gotten a few other people hooked.  I like the original and peanut butter ginger chews also but these are by far my favorites...will be ordering these again"
1;I purchased this as a last minute Christmas gift for my wife. It arrived as promised and was everything I hoped for. My wife loves smoked flavor uses it on everything. She couldn't be happier. You can smell the smoke as soon as she opens the container. My next problem is to find a covered shaker that will trap the smoke<br />and keep the salt fresh.
1;If you like smoked sea salts this is a very good product.  The smoke flavor is mild and the taste is great.  I put this salt in a grinder and find that the crystals are a bit small so it comes out fast.  I may switch to a small jar and salt spoon or a large holed shaker.  The 12.4 oz jar is enough to go a long way as seasoning salt.
1;"""This mustard is excellent! While it may not be the mustard you'd want for everyday recipes and is by no means the subtle mustard you'd want with many sandwiches it shines when it comes time to BBQ. Using this mustard when you BBQ chicken/hamburgers/Turkey burgers(especially) and about any marinade you'd use mustard for is a real treat. There is a somewhat pungent quality to the mustard that while it smells somewhat unpleasant when you first open it"
1;I use it everyday in my Visalus shakes.  It tastes great.  And only 45 calories for a serving?  Can't beat that.  Save yourself hundreds of calories a day by swapping this for normal peanut butter in your protein shakes.
1;"""I have purchased this  Organic Green Tea  locally and have to say its very good.  Its smooth and light... similar to other organic based green tea's I have tried. The price is more than fare... and would recommend."""
1;Don't even waste your time ordering this bag of soup from this vendor. It's advertised as 1 bag - and you can get 1 bag of the same soup at your local grocery store for under 4 dollars. Haha - this was in need of a review!
1;"""Any true southerner knows of the ecstasy brought on by popping one of these salty treats in their mouth.  But only those of us that have left the south have learned the true value of the green peanut.  They simply do not exist outside of the south.  While their is no substitute for buying a bag of fresh raw green peanuts and boiling them yourself"
1;This is a great bundle of different types of rice from Riceselet with the price of rice increasing it's a great deal. The plastic containers help keep the rice fresh and are reusable. All the directions are clear and concise I have cooked the rice in a rice cooker and on the stop top no issues. Recommend this and anything from Riceselect.
1;Great brand! And I'm really glad there's a trial pack - they are each a good size and helps to change it up when making rice with dinner. I've used the rice in various recipes - from pilafs to soups to quickly boiled or steamed.
1;"""I liked the way this manufacturer packages 4 types of right. It alowed me to try it before I decided to buy and I settled for the Jasmine after trying all all of them. So now I'll order the 4 pack in Jasmine and if you do the subscribe and save the cost is even better.<br />Good quality"
1;"""My dog is very picky and I spoil him all the time.  On his first birthday I bought him a nice cake with sprinkles on it from a very expensive high end dog store.  The cake was fresh made and he barely ate the cake.  It cost me like 25 dollars.  I found this at home goods and decided to try it for 8 dollars.  I have a little dog so I don't need alot of cake.  He only has a few dog friends and this cake was good enough for him and 3 dog friends.  And enough for another day to eat.  Yes its tiny but easy to make and my dog LOVED it!  I'm ordering more because its hard to find"
1;"""After using Nielsen Massey's Pure Vanilla Extract I would never be able to go back to using cheap artificial vanilla. There is just such a flavor difference. In fact friends ask me to put double the vanilla in my baked goods because they crave the flavor. I use this in banana bread"
1;"""I do the baking in my house. Let me make this short and sweet. This stuff simply makes whatever you're baking taste better. As a prime example. I have been making zucchini bread for months like theres no tomorrow. Everyone in my family has always loved it. I purchased a bottle of Nielsen Massey 4-Ounce Pure Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla Extract here on Amazon. From the first time I used it I started getting new complements.  What did you do different. It tastes even better.   Did you change the recipe? I liked it before but this is even better.  To me it really brings out a richer more complex flavor out of all the ingredients its combined with. At this point I'm out of zucchini and the bottle is almost empty too.<br /><br />Next time I will go for the 32oz bottle as its much cheaper by the ounce.<br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GE8N4Y >Nielsen-Massey 32 oz. Madagascar Bourbon Pure Vanilla Extract.</a>"""
1;"""I love to use superior quality products when I cook and this was certainly a  must-try  product for me. Now it's been turned into a  must-have  on hand product when I bake. I've used it for baking cakes and frostings. Has an excellent flavor. Will make you ever wonder why we have been subjected to grocery store baking products."""
1;"""We have been ordering this product for the past 6 months and always found the product to be of the highest quality. I eat this for breakfast every day with some nuts and butter and the texture of the oatmeal is outstanding.Since my son and wife dont like the oatmeal texture(nothing wrong with the product"
1;I ordered this Lipton Peach Tea for my wife.  She is the only one in the family that drinks it.  She always reminds me that this tea is the only brand and flavor she loves to drink.  She prepares it every day of the week and says it's just the best there is!!!
1;I got my bag o matcha about 5 days after ordering it. I am happy with the product-- it tastes good and dissolves more quickly and easily than more expensive alternatives. It is also more concentrated than other more expensive matcha powders I've had. You only need to use a little bit. Good deal. Thanks!
1;This is the best lemon cookie that I have ever tasted.  I bought a box at a Ross store and then never saw the product again.  I went on to Amazon and bought a case three weeks ago.  Between my friends and I they are gone.<br />I am going to buy another case.
1;Needed a Mother's Day gift for some family and friends and found this product and based on the reviews purchased it. Everyone loved the taste of the cookies and wanted to know where I purchased them. Great product at an excellent price. Will order more.
1;"""I absolutely love these shortbread cookies.  Unfortunately my store is out of them and doesn't know if they'll get them back in stock.  They are plain shortbread...not flavored.  I would order the butterscotch if I knew the nutrition count was the same.  Could someone give me the nutrition count on the flavored ones?<br /><br />The plain ones are:  76 cal"
1;We just tried this soup as a quick dinner fix during the work week.  The mix made plenty for dinner...plus left overs for lunch. Texture is great and satisfying. We topped with shredded cheese and a little sour cream and it was perfect. Id recommend this product if your looking for an easy quality meal to make in a quick time period that still tastes like a homemade soup. Great product!
1;for some reason all the food from amazon are better tasting then in the supermarkets i go to' i buy the same stuff from the markets it just do not tast the same i dont mind paying extra on shipping to purchase goods
1;really good in so many recipes. the product is fresh and it tastes delicious. it arrived in good condition. the price is good and it is delivered right to my front door. i am very happy with this purchase. there are many wonderful meals to include diced tomatoes.
1;Same as CAT review ..I discovered this product  when I was in my 30s' ( I'm 80 now) I had migraines for over thirty years and the pain and mausea were terrible. Cola helped with the nausea but they never treated migraine as anything but sn orphan disease.
1;"""I bought this in the 2 bag pack at Costco and was pleasantly surprised at how crispy and chocolately this cereal is. It's got just the right amount of sweetness and leaves you with a great bowl of chocolate milk at the end"
1;These are really good. Never ate cheerios until these came out. Now I have them in the house all the time. I eat them about2-3 times a week. Cheerios have recently come out with a peanut butter flavor. I like to mix the 2 flavors. OH SO.GOOD!!!!!!!!! Yummie in my tummy! Love them.
1;"""The other day daughter made a deliciously simple birthday cake for me using a boxed yellow cake an a single thin layer of this chocolate Shmear and it could not have been better! The taste is that of a high quality dark chocolate - related to grocery store brands"
1;"""When I was in Venice I purchased local red wine to find out what Italians drink at home. It did not taste like anything I had at the large wineries or even the upscale specialty wineries in Napa valley. I sampled the majority of California brands and varietals over a period of a decade in connection with my job. Carlo Rossi is part of Gallo and is a bulk wine. However"
1;"""This product is great! With that said it would have to sell for $22.80 per 12 pack to make it worth while to buy. I can get these all day long for $2.00 per can. That would put a 12 pack at $24.00 and that still wouldn't get me to bite! Fix the price"
1;"""This tea provides a luscious and refreshing break from your daily grind and helps you relax as well. It's got a great cherry taste to it that is not overpowering with just a hint of berry flavor thrown in for good measure. Let it steep about three minutes and you're bound to enjoy it as much as I do!<br /><br />Each bag contains all-natural ingredients"
1;"""I have enjoyed herbal teas for many years.  Several years ago my wife and I started to entertain groups in our home.  At the first session I decided to offer the guests some tea.  Many of the guests liked my tea"
1;"""I have tried-out this fine tea in several ways now. It was great each way -- hot or icy by itself -- or hot or icy added to regular black tea. My primary purpose was to find a good cherry tea to make my own black cherry black tea blend. This black cherry herbal tea does very well for this -- at about one bag of black cherry herbal tea per three bags of regular black tea. It is not as tart as a  zinger  type tea -- rather just spot-on to back the black cherry blend. Celestial Seasonings has fine-tuned this blend of various organic ingredients very well -- to find a mix which is most like a rich tart black cherry tea -- great on its own or in a further mix +++"""
1;"""I absolutely adore anything cherry.  I bought this tea in the sampler fruit package of teas.  I was curious how this would taste.  My favorite Celestial Seasonings tea is Lemon Zinger.  This is a close tie.  I know everyone says  you don't even need sugar  but I use sugar.<br /><br />I have not seen this tea sold by the box in my local store.  When I run out"
1;I love this stuff and it's good for you (or at least it's not bad for you).  Pretty much every day I make a large pot of one of the Celestial Seasoning's fruit teas (Black Cherry is one of my favorites) which I chill and it's my drink for the day.  It freezes well such that I can take it with me when I'm out for the day and the kids will drink it (and not bug me as much for soda and the like).
1;"""When I adopted my cat they were feeding her science diet cat food. I kept her on that for only about 2 more weeks after before she was starting to refuse to eat the food and would go for my other cat's food that wasn't science diet. So I switched her to that and she ate that for awhile before getting fussy again and not wanting to eat that either. After trying out a few other foods I saw this food at our local animal store and decided to try it out. That was about a year ago now and so far I haven't had a single problem with this food. Both my cats love it and seem to like this food a lot better than the canned food even. The Royal Canin food overall might be a bit more pricey than others"
1;"""I bought this kibble for my senior cat after trying several brands. She is healthy but has trouble digesting kibble. Her hairball problem has disappeared and she likes it very much. My other three cats also eat this and no longer have a problem with hairballs. All four are full of energy and look good (fur is soft and gleaming"
1;"""I have to say I am really glad I read the reviews about this licorice.<br />Sandy R hit the taste on the nose. I also remembered the Callard & Bowser English company who sold the best licorice I ever had (at that time). My grandmother introduced it to me. The licorice toffee candies came in a silver box with each piece separately covered with striped silver and black wrapping. It also came with a certificate of quality. I fell in love with the taste instantly and bought it when ever I could. I was heartbroken when I found that Callard & Bowser went out of business. This confection is so similar to the original taste I fell in love with that the after my first piece"
1;If you like real black Licorice you will love these yummy soft and creamy licorice caramels. When i was younger growing up i used to enjoy licorice toffee by a company in England i believe the name was Collard & Bowser ? These Dutch licorice caramels are just as good or better and i plan on repeat purchases of this product.
1;I got these for the hubby and son. Their birthdays are on the same day and I was planning on splitting them up between them since they both love licorice.<br />I had to test them of course. Very nice. A touch grainy in my opinion but still delish!!<br />They are also individually wrapped which is great since they are going in a candy dish for the hubby's desk at work.<br />Very pleased with this product all around.
1;"""Ive hunted high and low and have tried every type of licorice toffee that I can find since C&B stopped making licorice toffee. Spot on in flavor.  I've read other reviews that outfields or other brands are better.  They are very salty.  If you're a super salty licorice fan"
1;"""This is good if you like soft licorice and caramel. Not so good if you're not supposed to eat licorice (like if you have high blood pressure) or sugar.  It's wicked.  I'm bagging it and putting it in stockings as 'coal.'  If I can keep from eating it all before Christmas"
1;"""This licorage is the best EVER! Being from Europe I am very  picky  about finding good licorage. No more store-bought regular American Licorage for me.<br />I WILL ABSOLUTELY ORDER again from you.<br /><br />Eva C."""
1;"""All 3 of my cats love this food.  They were previously on Wellness Turkey and when the cans were recalled I tried this on the suggestion of a family friend since their one cat has the same crystal issues our oldest does.  He eats his prescription dry in the morning and this at night.  Normally he's content to let the other two cats get to their food first and hold back with patience for his own"
1;"""Wow! I have the pickiest cats in the whole universe.  The only wet food they eat is Spot's Stew Chicken.  I can get them to eat the Chicken/Beef flavor if I add some shaved Bonito but with three cats Slinky"
1;I feed my cats Halo dry food and supplement it with a little of the canned food.  They love it and they are very happy and healthy.  The canned food is amazing - looks and smells like people food.  I've been buying this for years and have no intention of switching to something else.  If you read the labels you'll see how good this stuff is.
1;I was surprised to find that the canned Halo cat food is low in protein - even lower than Science Diet wet KD for cats.  And my cat refuses to eat the Science Diet food anyway.  She loves this (turkey) and also the chicken and salmon.
1;"""I started using  Flavor Doh  after trying  pill pouches  which are expensive and inconvenient.  It is easy and very inexpensive to use especially when daily medication is necessary.  I just dip some out with the capsule and stick another small pill on the tip and  Duke  gobbles it down.  He runs to me when I tell him it's time for pills.  Duke is a 6 year old toy poodle."""
1;"""I give my dog a powder medication that is very foul tasting. He has IBS so cannot give him cheese or anything else to encase the medicine.  I have been using Flavor-Doh for the past two years and it is an outstanding product.  It is so easy to flatten the doh"
1;"""I often wonder if I am the only person in the world who cannot stand microwave popcorn.  Give me real corn and a little oil and I am pretty happy.  Then I discovered this popcorn at a kitchen store in my local outlet.  Then they went out of business and I lost my awesome popcorn connection... until now.<br /><br />Wabash Valley Farms is the best popcorn you can get outside of your local multi-plex (though I really like target popcorn too).  You don't need the whirly popper as indicated on the package instructions - I always cook it on the stovetop in a large covered pot"
1;"""I own two super automatics (Capresso and Gaggia) and a separate Kitchen Aid drip coffee machine.  My wife and I drink at least two cups per day and host weekly gatherings of about a dozen people.<br /><br />After trying majority of the Starbucks"
1;"""Mix this with your mayo or sourcream to make the BEST potato salad ever.  It is one of those products in your mom's and grandmother's kitchens that will never disappoint.  Full of flavor and a good keeper"
1;"""My 16 year old cat had been on dry food since I adopted her from the shelter 13 years ago. A couple of years or so ago she became very finicky and refused her regular brand. I then switched her to an 'all natuaral' version by the same maker. She did fine on that for awhile then out of the blue she'd have nothing more to do with it. I decided to give wet food a go. As she's becoming more&more picky in her golden years that was a hit&miss ordeal. Seems as fast as I'd  stock up on her favorite variety of a brand she'd decide she didn't want it anymore.  Every other day I'd have to trek out to the store(in the harsh Michigan winter no less)to find something to feed her. I finally decided to pick up a few cans of Fancy Feast at CVS. I had steered clear of FF because of the  high price of those tiny cans. Since I was desperate to get food into kitty I caved. I bought every different variety my local CVS had on the shelf. She didn't want the flaked variety. She wouldn't touch the shredded meals. She loved the food in the gravy"
1;"""My two cats usually like Fancy Feast the most. I think it is because this brand doesn't add bread or corn as filler so it smells better. The seafood variety is my favorite.<br /><br />I like to buy this from amazon because the price is about 1/3 to 1/2 less than at store and you get 3 varieties in one box"
1;"""My cat is very picky with her food. We used to feed her dry food with an occasional treat of wet food but now we are changing it to dry food in the morning and a can of wet food in the evening. Fancy feast classic is in pate form which my cat prefers. We usually get these in fish or seafood flavor"
1;A very convenient product. This package of Fancy Feast cat food is convenient delivered to your front door. It is comparable in price to the cat food purchased in the local grocery store in a favorable way.
1;A friend's research to find a good food for her diabetic cat revealed that the choices specifically in the FF Classic are lower in carbs than most on the market. Her cat's diabetes resolved and she attributed it to the FF Classic.<br />Can't beat the price through this seller and shipping arrangement!
1;"""I have a lovely snowshoe siamese named Mocha and she loves this.  she isnt a big eater....as in she likes to eat little bits here and there with all types of food offered to her.  I feed about 1/3 a can of this and sometimes mix in fresh cooked meat or fresh green vegetables for her nightly meal.  i do want her eating fresh food as i believe any processed food isnt good for anyone--man or animal.  Mocha isnt a fan of fresh food"
1;"""My Fancy Feast cat has always loved the classic best!  He can be anywhere and all I have to do is yell  FANCY FEAST  ...he is at his bowl in a flash.  Perhaps he knows his pic is on the can :)  Anyway I tell him it is...the resemblance is close.  I've tried the grill and the shredded stuff.  It is apparently not as yummy because my  Feather  (white fur-ball of a cat) picks at those versions.  Feather is going on 14 yrs of age so it must be healthy."""
1;This product has a light coconut fragrance and taste.  Makes it much easier to take as a supplement.  However it does alter the taste of food slightly so keep that in mind when cooking with it.  Will report later on any health benefits I notice with it.
1;I originally found these at Wegman's and tried the Chili and the Olive Oil and Sea Salt varieties.  They were a big hit with everyone that tried them.  When I returned to Wegman's to get more they were out of the Olive Oil and Sea Salt so I headed online.  I recommend that you try these with relatively strong flavored cheeses since they are fairly thick and aggressively seasoned.  Wegman's got them back in stock so I will buy from them because of the great difference in cost.  On line is very expensive.
1;A healthy treat that is hard to find in stores.  I cant give my dog anything Chicken (allergic) and found the Sweet Potato glucosamine treats here on Amazon at a great price too. My Lab absolutely loves them and the glucosamine is good for his hips.
1;"""My dog LOVES these treats!! And I feel good about giving them to her because they are natural and healthy. Plus the glucosamine has eliminated her joint stiffness and the vitamins have increased her vitality. Buy these treats for your dogs"
1;"""I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered these.  I knew my dog liked sweet potatoes and because I've been buying Dogswell Happy Hips brand treats for years I thought we'd give it a try.  Here's the skinny:<br /><br />They are smaller than the other treats.  This is because they are pieces of dried sweet potato with chicken wrapped around them!  This makes them a bit chewy and thus should work well to aid in the daily cleansing of your dog's teeth.  There is no unpleasant odor"
1;"""My dog has food allergies so it's hard to find snacks for her since she can't have biscuits or meaty treats. She loves these!! The are dried so they can be a little tough to chew so they might not be great for older dogs"
1;Dogswell brand treats are the best I have found. After the gluten scare I searched for natural ingredients treats and found these which he loves. Even though they are made in china they are continually tested here in the US for quality control and have always passed. My dog has alergies and with two basic ingrediants I don't have to worry. He is also a picky eater when it comes to treats and he takes these every time.
1;"""Our vet told us to switch our dog to a treat that contained ingredients he hadn't had on a regular basis because we're working to determine what is producing an itchy allergic reaction.  So far it looks like he may be allergic to chicken and maybe corn"
1;Stella starts her day with chicken and banana treats or chicken and apple.  My little rescue dog loves her treat and waits patiently for it every morning.  I can only tell you that it must be tasty because she is both happy and satisfied ... A wonderful way to start her day. This is a great product and I recimmend it!
1;Any dog puppy to senior and any breed dog loves these treats.  They go crazy over them!!!  They are healthy too.  I have been buying them for a few years now.  How I first found out about them is I read an article online about the oldest dog to live ate these treats.  So that made me want to buy them for the health of them.  So I do feel good about feeding healthy treats that dogs really like the taste of!!!
1;All my dogs enjoy this product.  They can't get enough.  It is packed with healthy ingredients so I don't mind giving them this treat often.  I can't keep up on the orders as they go through them so quickly.  They are offered through subscription order on Amazon and you save a good amount. I compared the prices with the local pet supply store and these treats go $5.99+ a bag whereas I am paying $21.34 for six bags and free shipping.  I am very satisfied.
1;My poodle just loves these healthy and nutritious snacks.  The natural sweetness of the apple combined with the chewiness of the chicken wrap makes a perfect treat.  He jumps for joy at the sight of the bag (which is resealable for freshness).  Great choice!
1;What a wonder healthy treat we have discovered! I never would have imagined that Teecos Niceah Misty Blue would eat bananas!!! Happy Hips also aids us in our training. Niceah is a certified AKC registered Pet Therapy Dog and our patients have enjoyed giving Niceah her Happy Hips Chicken and Banana Treats during our visits. We highly recommend these treats to all happy canines! Robin and Niceah Kulik
1;"""Ever try the goldfish crackers?  They taste as much like the box as they do cheese.  The TLC Country Cheddar crackers are far superior.  They taste of cheddar and the texture balances smooth with crunchy"
1;"""We tried these whole grain crackers with our one year old daughter as an alternative to the 'junk' crackers that are marketed to children.  She loves them!  She even asks for them when it's time for snack and my husband loves them as well.  Be aware"
1;"""Matcha green really works! I am so glad I decided to give it a chance. I am quite a skeptic about trying new products. It does exactly what I have been researching. It gives me energy and controls my appetite. I also tried it as a facial mask. It left my skin with a nice and beautiful glow. I have recommended this product to my mother-in-law"
1;I just got into drinking Matcha and have been fascinated by it. This is an excellant product for a reasonable price. I have been drinking it once a day and this quantity of a half pound will last 3-4 months. Not bad for $16. I greatly enjoy the calmness of mind and energy it gives me. I like to add a little honey to it. For a good read on its health benefits check out the amnio acid that is in it called L-theanine.
1;I purchased some macha at a health food store and figured it was the best quality. I was assuming that with the bright color and smell it was the best. It was good-----but this macha tea is BETTER in my opinion. The color is darker-but the smell is stronger--which told me this was going to be more potent than what I had tried before. So far it gives me a great boost and my body likes it as well. ---I'm highly sensative to what I put into my body and I was happy to feel I made a great choice with this company and product. ****I plan to buy more in the future------
1;I am so happy I purchased this. I put it in my morning green smoothies in addition to drinking throughout the day. I prefer the taste over regular bagged green tea. We also use ut to make home made mochi.
1;"""I would (occasionally) treat myself by purchasing vanilla smoothies from my employer's cafeteria at a cost of $4 per 12oz. serving. Since this treat was a bit expensive I researched to determine if I could purchase a product that would produce the same reward. I read the reviews of the other buyers of this product"
1;"""These have a very sour coating over a fruity sweet hard candy.  The coating disappears in 10-20 seconds.  They're about 2-3X the size of a Tic-Tac.  You must love sour candy to enjoy them.  Only 20 calories for 5 pieces"
1;Being French I grew up knowing how important it was to use a good unrefined salt. The one from Brittany being the very best. No! It's not foolish to spent money on a  basic spice. It has a very delicate flavor (almost floral) and you don't need a lot. Will taste great on salads. A clear healthy winner.
1;"""i toast these on a cookie sheet at 400 in the oven for 12 minutes. i toast enough for a week's breakfasts. then i put one portion in the blender and grind. pour into bowl. add boiling water. voila! instant hot oatmeal! add any flavoring you usually add to cereals.<br /><br />btw i tried to sprout these and they did not sprout. i ate the soaked groats raw though"
1;"""This is one of the best Mystic Chai teas and I have been drinking it for several years. My order always comes on time and in excellent condition.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YXXKTK >Mystic Chai Spiced Tea - 2 - 2 lb cans</a><br />I have tried other Chai teas"
1;This is one of my favorite teas.  I was not able to find it any where else but Amazon.  The product says to make it with water but I prefer milk to give it a creamier taste.  I even have all my co-workers hooked on it.
1;I also first tried Mystic Chai Spiced Tea when Sam's Club sold it. But when they stopped I had torn off the label from my last can I had purchased which had their email on it.  Well I just found it about a month ago and immediately emailed the company. They responded quickly letting me know I can still purchase it online at Sam's Club or straight from them but I checked with Amazon just in case and found it. It is just as great as I remember it. I have also tried other chai's but they do not EVEN come close to Mystic Chai.  You will not go wrong with Mystic Chai.
1;I am a chai-aholic. I don't drink coffee and discovered chai a long time ago at starbucks. We used to get this from sam's club but then they stopped carring it and had another brand called Enchanted Chai...just not the same taste! So don't waste your time with any other brand!!! I just googled the Mystic brand one day and found it on amazon. I don't mind paying a little more to get my fix. haha...it really is the best tasting chai. I always mix it with milk...:)
1;I was SOOO happy to find this online! I saw it once around Valentine's Day then it was gone! Pink Lemonade cakes are a favorite and I was glad I could buy it again. About the shipper: came on time..no issues there!
1;They carry this at Walmart and it's outstanding.  It tastes just like sweet baby rays.  I especially like it because the jerky is on the softer end... none of those endlessly chewy pieces.  It has a really great after taste too. Try it out!
1;This is the best jerky I have ever tasted!  To the guy who gave this a two star rating because they changed the flavor from the 80s?  They didn't mass produce Sweet Baby Rays until the mid 90's so your product review is based on a completely different product or you clicked on the wrong link/product to review.
1;"""Buying this item was a real shot in the dark. Mother has high blood pressure and this was an alternative salt product. We are VERY pleased with the way it tastes. It has a little bit stronger taste so don't need to use as much as you do table salt in order to get the same flavor. We bought the three pack"
