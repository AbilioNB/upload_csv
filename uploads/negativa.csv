0;"""My cats have been happily eating Felidae Platinum for more than two years. I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different. They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food. I've noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past. Unfortunately"
0;"""Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea"
0;Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come. There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack. You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor.
0;This candy is not as described. The middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described.<br />Looks and tastes like it's way past it's expiration date.<br />Would never reccommend this. Paid a good chunk of cash for nothing
0;"""I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues. It reeks like a chemical rubber smell. This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid. When I called to report the situation to the company"
0;"""I paid $1.79 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today. I bought them because brown rice is a  good  carb.  As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients.  The name is deceptive - these have  Masa corn flour  listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste.  I won't buy these again - I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste."""
0;This mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping. Nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box. 3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top. There were no tears in the packages.
0;"""These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.<br /><br />For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case  & Chive ) chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour"
0;"""I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color"
0;"""When originally produced in England  these we're the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty. Hard rather than crispy"
0;"""I've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning.  Keeps you from eating too many!  Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazon.com and this was one.  Unedible.  Beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case"
0;I bought this brand as a trial since I am tired of the Pingos.<br /><br />It claims that it is natural. I have no argument on this. But the point is that more than 50% in the bag is over-fried and in brown color. I really suffer eating the over-fried chips. I open some other bags and it looks like the same. So I just throw away all of them. I don't know if I was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same. But for sure I will never buy this brand any more.
0;I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORS<br />SALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPER<br />TUSCAN 3 CHEESE<br />N.Y. CHEDDAR AND HERS<br /><br />THEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME.  IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZE.<br /><br />I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS.
0;"""I Was sent 3 week past  Fresh by date  stock. Chips are noticeably not fresh in taste. Won't order again.<br /><br />EDIT: And just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it"
0;I am very disappointed with this product because I could not see how many calories it has at the time I ordered it. I received it and now I can see it has 60 calories per tablespoon. Granulated sugar has only 45 calories per tablespoon. How could Agave Nectar be better than sugar?
0;"""I am a preschool teacher and do a G is for Gingerbread unit every January. I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found. Which is odd. I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week. I looked everywhere and could not find ont. So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday. I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The gingerbread itself came broken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken. It's non returnable. I called Amazon"
0;The US made version of this Cadbury chocolate has a distinct taste from the UK version of the chocolate which I have been eating since childhood. I did not like this new taste. To all my friends from India -- buy this chocolate if it is either made in UK or India
0;"""My daughter had extensive food allergies as an infant/toddler and we bought these bars consistently.  She still has the nut and egg allergy so I like that I can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe.  Unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars (all varieties) they have been hard as a rock and my daughter won't eat them.  I have tried them myself and thought I might break a tooth. I had them on subscribe and save"
0;Refer to the picture I posted above.  The bar is half the size you think it is going to be...It is literally a two-bite bar.  Very deceptive advertising.  That and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star.  My 10 year old son ate one and didn't like them. I ate one and agreed as did my husband.  Couldn't give it away!  Everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as I'm concerned.
0;Only three jars came in a form edible to babies.  The rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water.  It also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixture.<br />Pretty disappointing and a waste of money.
0;I just wanted to post here that I found small bits of plastic in this food as I was feeding my 9 month old.  Plastic!!! in food!!!! baby food!!!  So please be careful if you buy this or are considering it.<br /><br />My daughter LOVES this food-- it's actually her favorite.  This is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over 2 months.
0;"""I first tasted Sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it.  So I started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form.  After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea.  I was told is was Pappy's Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked online and found it at Amazon.com.  As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought I'd order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didn't taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice"
0;"""OMG I would love these cookies except for the chocolate mixed in makes it taste medicinal. DEGUSTING isn't even a strong enough word. A horrible horrible mistake...an expensive mistake....they advertised it as peanut butter cookies which is why I bought them since everyone else had peanut butter chocolate cookies when I just wanted plan peanut butter cookies....however when I received them I found out they were the chocolate peanut butter ones but I thought okay I'll try them and omg I almost threw up from the taste. HORRIBLE"
0;"""I have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since I was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in Canada. This is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available. I recently got back from a trip to Montreal"
0;These had heat and had good enough coating of the seasoning. The first 2 cases were amazing best i had ever. Then they restocked and tried 4-5 cases and they taste either like plain chips or slight hint of seasoning on them. What a shame they seemed to cut back on quality to save money. Bad Uncle Ray!
0;"""Bought Uncle Ray's Wavy's 16 oz potato chips because purchased  Uncle Ray's 16 oz barbque potato chips in the past and was very pleased. Oh how wrong we were.  Do not purchase the Wavy's chips!!!!!!!!!!  They are the quality of buying a no name bag of chips from a roadside service station store"
0;"""I just received these bricks today and was very disappointed to find that BOTH of the bricks were broken and unusable as a serving/cooking plate.  They were busted completed in half. They were packaged in one sleeve of small bubble wrap in a shallow box with no other protection or packaging in the box.  I went online to try and return them and they are not eligible for return.  This is the first return I've ever tried to do in over 7 years of purchasing items off of amazon (to the tune of several orders a month!) and yet the one time that I want to return a defective product"
0;This vendor is unscrupulous. She ripped off her cultures from other collectors and shamelessly claims them as her own. She has no conscience and I would highly recommend that you do your purchasing elsewhere.
0;"""This was a disappointment.  I use other products from this line/manufacturer on a regular basis.  I bought this item as a convenience to carry liquid Stevia in my purse.  The first time I went to use it"
0;"""I ordered these lollipops for a friends Wizard of Oz themed shower. The arrived packaged well but I noticed the box said they're from  Oriental Trading Company .  If I wanted a cheap product that I knew was low quality and from China then I would have bought them directly from their site at $7 for 38 of them!!! However"
0;"""I purchased these for my candy buffet at my wedding and I'm not impressed at all. I could have saved money by ordering them directly from Oriental Trading Company which is clearly where they came from. they look cheap and they're not as colorful as shown in the picture. the Oriental Trading Company information is on the back of the wrappers on the lollipops. most of the lollipop sticks are bent and two lollipops arrived broken. the box only has 12 lollipops"
0;"""For christmas I ordered some coupons from my daughters school for $30.00 off Ohama steaks.  I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.

0;"""Loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form.  This tea is black tea with prickly pear  flavor . The shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea.  If there is a prickly pear component it is all but undetectable when I drink it. It just tastes like regular black tea.  Very disappointing."""
0;"""It is not the best way to buy Beer Nuts.<br /><br />Perhaps the product had been exposed to high heat and a  whole lot of shaking .  Most of the  coating  and  flavoring  was off of the nuts.  Even though the individual cans are  sealed "
0;"""I bought this 4 pack to have some inexpensive caviar to use for garnish over the holidays. The other night I decided to go ahead and use one for some dip. It was so bad I couldn't believe it. It wasn't spoiled"
0;I ordered this for gifts around Christmas time. I actually was hoping to use it for our Christmas day meal. Two out of the four jars I ordered were rotten and inedible. I never did get to try it and I was very annoyed and disappointed!
0;"""i found this product doing a search for  edible gold leaf.  i decided to purchase after reading rave reviews about food items that were created using it. HOWEVER.. it is clearly marked  NOT to be consumed  and  for decorative use only.  so this is a misleading product."""
0;This coffee is absolutely horrendous.  I cannot believe it has any favorable reviews and agree with the other reviewer who believes positive reviews were written by employees.  I cannot stress enough how bad this coffee is.  It doesn't even taste like coffee.  The best way to describe it is a cup of chemicals.  I am really bummed I cannot returned this.  A complete waste of money.  It all went in the garbage.
0;how come you sent me instant choc.fudge pudding...<br />the order told you to send me the COOK & SERVE choc.fudge pudding....<br />you show the picture of it....<br />why couldn't send it to me....<br />it makes me wonder if I should order anything else from you....<br />pissed
0;"""I tried the Martha White Turtle Fudge Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe and these are the worst cookies I have ever made. Either there is someone on the staff of Martha White who has a lopsided sense of humor OR their taste buds have taken a permanent vacation. I wasted my time"
0;Found this product for sale on vacation in North Carolina and loved it... great maple flavor!! Walmart sold it for 3.99$ for the 24oz pack. Wish i would have bought some more while I was there because i'm not paying 15$ for what Walmart can sell for 4$. That is just robbery... very disappointed in @#@zon for their insanely high price... If price was reasonable would love to buy more and rate much higher!!
0;I read the reviews on this and thought id get some for my dog and pup.<br />They will not touch it. Even if I mix it with home cooked food.<br /><br />They like the dollar store dog food better than this.<br /><br />Amazon let me down on even allowing this dog food to be sold under their name.
0;I bought those chips after reading good reviews but I was very disappointed with the taste. It was nothing like what I expected (granted that I expected good old kettle cooked potato chips). I bought the 6-flavor variety pack and there were many flavors I did not care for. It was worth trying them but I am not going to purchase them again in the future.
0;"""I've been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herb/vegetable/salad bins inside to grow vegetables and I thought the Prepara Herb Savor Pod looked like the perfect precursor. Wrong. The detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere. Similarly"
0;After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there. I would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health!
0;Ordered this a few months ago only to find it is just basically lactic acid.  Read the ingredients.  The main label says olive juice by no such thing.  I am going to suggest that Amazon take this off the website.
0;"""I have an immense love for pancakes.  I have been on a search for the best pancake mix for about a year. I did not write this review prematurely as I wanted to give the product a fair chance.  I tried it with whole milk.  I tried it with buttermilk. I tried it with blueberries. I tried it without blueberries.  It is by far the WORST mix I have tried thus far.  The flavor is not good"
0;Part of me wants to ask for a refund. I bought this package of k cups because I wanted a mix of teas. When I got my package I was very disappointed to see hardly any teas in the package. I know they substituted based on availability but I think it's completely misleading to substitutes with products that don't pertain to the packaged theme. I got a mix of gingerbread and eggnog. DISAPPOINTING!
0;I got two Teas and one type of iced coffe and the rest were HOLIDAY COFFEES and APPLE CIDER!  Spicy Eggnog? Gingerbread? Bait and swtich.  The only redeeming factor - Amazon was great and issued me a refund.
0;"""you won't BELIEVE how many ways this product has saved my life!  I only gave it one star because i'm so dehydrated from drinking regular water all week because i ran out of money before my penta ran out.  when i can afford another shipment"
0;"""The site doesn't list the ingredients for their products online.  Had I known the product was full of trans fats I would not have ordered it.  Watch your labels.  Partially hydrated = partially hydrogenated.  You have to laugh at the ways manufacturers will try to fool the public.  In the future I will not order a product that doesn't list its ingredients online so that consumers can make informed purchases.<br /><br />Did try the product and found it tasteless.  No heat/spice and it left a waxy film on the roof of the mouth"
0;"""I have a special needs pet and searched for the right food.  Since Amazon has been a five star resource I chose to have Pot Pie shipped. Many of the cans are dented.  So I have to toss them or return. This is a big hassle but would not ever feed a dented can to my beloved boy.  Best to purchase at the pet store"
0;ordered some from an amazon-fulfilled associate. Normal amazon shipping etc...The cigars were cracked and stale. How does chewing gum shatter and break? No way it was fit for consumption.<br />Easy return process.
0;The label is misleading. Cento actually sells two kind of San Marzano with the same label other than one that says D.O.P. certified. You will receive the one w/o the D.O.P. if you order from Amazon. I have made the mistake in the grocery store not realizing Cento sells ones are D.O.P and ones that are not and did not realize till it was too late. The true D.O.P. ones I have to say make the best sauce! You can taste the difference.
0;"""Buyer beware! The label on the Amazon site clearly states  D.O.P Certified  but the product received does NOT match the site label and does NOT state  D.O.P. Certified  This is bait and switch and I will file a complaint with Amazon."""
0;"""these are not DOP they're just  certified  which means nothing significant. they should go a step further with a little more nonsense and write  department certified . real dop tomatoes are much better."""
0;They tomatoes are certified San Marzano but not DOP like the item shows in picture. I called amazon and they sent me another box of 12 for free to fix issue. THe new shipment was still certified not DOP.  So please know this. Tomatoes are ok but not the best fyi.
0;Merchandise was not damaged during shipment but supplier send me damaged and incorrect merchandise.  3/4 of the cans were badly dented and the cans they shipped were not DOP Certified.  They sent me lower standard merchandise.  Received full refund from Amazzon.
0;"""I was disappointed when I received this dispenser.  It said a large dispenser.  It looks like something for a child to play with.  I bought it for my husband to put in his  man cave .  He is a huge M&M fan.  I buy him a tree ornament each year from the M&M collections.  I was hoping it had more substance to it.  I also did not realize I was unable to return this item."""
0;The picture shown is for three packages and the price is fair for three but I was only sent one but was charged for three. Also the item sent was not the item shown. I can buy the item shipped all day long at any local grocery store. I went to Amazon because I was looking for the type shown.<br /><br />When I contacted the seller and told them about this they said they would give me partial credit for the item but nothing for shipping. Seeing as how I was shipped something I didn't order I should be entitled to a full refund including shipping. I was not offered that.<br /><br />If I could give this seller negative stars I would. Any future buyers beware.
0;Please contact the manufacturer and ask them to change back to the old formula if you love this product! We just cancelled our subscription of 8 cases per month because the new formula is disgusting! Not buying again unless the change back to the old version!
0;I'm a little shocked that this so-called health food product is made from Chinese grown ingredients.  I'd be curious to see what the carbon footprint of each bite is.  Also keep in mind that Chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products. All the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the United States.  Why not support products and companies who source locally and consider our own economy before we sell out for a slightly cheaper price?  Your purchasing choice does make a difference.  Let's stop expecting corporations and governments to take care of our safety and economy.  They never will.  We can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical well-being. Make purchase decisions wisely.
0;Mrs. May's should inform their customers where exactly their products are made and take a stand. I won't be buying any more of her products until further notice no matter how yummy they are. Do-no-harm and quality-control is a concept not understood in China. Totally frightening what they're getting away with.
0;I used to buy these as healthy snacks at my office cafeteria and consider it better than a bag of potato chips.  These taste very crunchy and tasty.<br /><br />Given the kind of unethical food stories we read about China - we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these.  You just cannot import food stuff and sell in the US as gourmet snack food - there needs to be data backing this.<br /><br />Few example of Chinese food (yuk ...):<br /><br />(1) Melamine(kind of platic) in baby food and milk (so wide spread that 80% of milk in China contained this plastic in 2008)<br /><br />(2) Honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin (antibiotic) - because of which it was banned in the US<br /><br />(3) Soy Sauce made from Human hair (not joking google it if you want)<br /><br />(4) Spurious drugs exported to African countries.<br /><br />Need some good facts and quality controls from the Manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls.
0;"""Do not spend your money on this product as you will find the popping ratio extremely poor. One cup of popcorn will have 1/2 cup of  un poped (old Mades) kernels left over which is unacceptable.This is a non returnable item so if you buy this one you are just out of luck"
0;I am so surprised that they have this popcorn for sale.  I received 6 bags the other day and the special popcorn pan from Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country ....GOURMET ... well.. the popped kernels are the size of a pea and with hulls.  It burns very easily.  There are too many old maids due to the delicate nature of the kernel.  I ended up throwing most of the popped corn away.  I am so disappointed in this product.  I now have 5.75 bags of this stuff ... I have nothing good to say about it ... but if you like tiny popped corn with lots of hulls then this may be your product.  I am giving mine to the squirrels.

0;When I placed my order it was for Hartz Pigskin 10 pack with sweet potato center.  When I received the order it was Hartz Pigskin 10 packs but it was all pigskin and this is not easy for my dog to chew.  I contacted the company and they were very nice about the hole thing as they refunded the money to my credit card and told me to take the pigskin packs to a local shelter or SPCA.  They were also very fast in sending out the original product.  They told me that they forgot to change the photo from sweet potato center to all wrapped pigskin and they would do that.
0;"""These things are NOTHING like Oreos.You think wow Oreos. Think again. I would say spend your money on something better (the Hershey's or Reese's crisp wafer bars come to mind). My honest view on these  thin crisps  cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer"
0;This comes in a case of 24 so I bought one can locally before ordering the large amount.  Good move!  I have 3 cats and none of them would eat it. This review is for the mature gourmet beef entree. Haven't tried the other favors yet.

Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact"
0;I did not know anything about chutney until I went on a known recipe cite and found out that they mix the fruit with peppers and vinegar! I thought chutney was a different form of Marmalade but I was wrong!
0;"""We purchased this product and were greatly disappointed.  The product did not have the texture or the taste that it should have.  We contacted customer service and when they discovered that we were complaining"
0;It has artificial sweetener which not only taste bad to me but also gives me a headache. This should say light or diet to let the buyer know this. I would have never bought it had I known. It seems like it would taste good otherwise.

0;"""I have never tasted such a poor excuse for a cocoa drink. It has such a bad aftertaste that I checked the box to see if I ordered sugarfree by mistake! I will toss this  and chalk it up to a loss but if you are reading this"
0;I bought this to include in my daughter's party bag - It worked so well with the circus theme that we had.  Unfortunately the cracker jacks were stale.  When I heard this the first time I thought no way can't be but then someone else told me the same thing and then I heard it again from someone else.  Really disappointing.  I am so embarrassed.
0;Ordered this and most of the boxes were stale and stuck together.<br /><br />Checked the expiration date and it wasn't expired.<br /><br />Starting to think they just changed the expiration date and shipped everything that went bad.
0;"""Original description and order said  Assorted  chocolates. What I got--weeks (!) later--was one pack of all white chocolates (the least desirable).

0;These look like typical sugar plum jellies but they are actually grape flavored. You would assume that they would have a sugar plum flavor. They taste like cheap Kool-Aid and not the yummy Jelly Belly ones I can't seem to find on Amazon.
0;"""This product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent Gluten free as well as non-gluten free baking products. DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market"

0;Tried these the other day because of the low price and regreted it from the moment the jar was opened. These sausages tasted like card board soaked in beef flavored vinegar. Im used to eating Glazier's pickled sausages that snap when you bite them. Guess I will stick to what I like.
0;"""I don't enjoy giving products a bad review but I was so disappointed I had to.  I've tried quite a few teas and I've been able to drink teas that others say taste like dirty dish water so I can get down some pretty harsh teas.  I usually don't use any type of sweeteners either because I drink my tea right before bed.  I've tried to give this tea a chance.  Ive tried it with sugar"
0;"""It saddens me to say I had to return this item.  The item's page specifically said the Calamares were packed in Olive Oil.  However on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil....an unhealthy oil.  That was the bad news.  The good news is Amazon"
0;I did not know that I was ordering biscuit crumbs. That is exactly what I received. Such a lousy product. It's Amazon's fault for shipping out expires products. Will NEVER order food from Amazon.com ever.
0;I have been purchasing this product for about 9 months.  The taste of the product is inconsistent from lot number to lot number. I have gotten 3 cases where the chips had no flavor at all.  Have contacted the manufacturer 2 times.  Have not received a response from my latest inquiry. I don't recommend purchasing.

0;I made the waffles and was not impressed.<br />Definitely not worth the expense!<br /><br />It's only redeeming quality was that I seasoned it to bread oven fried pork chops.<br />I would rather have saved my money and made up a flour mix from scratch.
0;"""Was awful. The sight of this in my pan made me sick...smells like POTATO  duh potato starch)...would not brown. My child laughed the entire time...as I complained because I was so hungry and thought I could have a late night pancake session. Totally not the case.  Yes"
0;Pure toxic garbage. Eat poison if you want to. Toxic metals. Go ahead and buy this junk and feed yourself poison. Look at all the high ratings. Apparently people love eating toxic metals. Not harmful? Would you eat sodium mercury phosphate? Enjoy your metals.
0;A great idea that falls short. Bisquick gluten-free still uses an aluminum-based baking powder that is toxic to humans.

I appreciate the effort anyone puts into a GF product but I couldn't buy this one again. It was like eating reconstituted potatoes that lookes like pancakes. No butter or gravy"
0;"""Going gluten free is not optional for those diagnosed with celiac disease---- but eating a pizza made with a dough created with this product is optional---and definitely not recommended.

0;These sticks definitely don't look like ones in the picture.<br />They are much thinner and IMHO not worth the money. I should have returned it but instead gave my dog (GSD) 5 at a time to keep her busy.<br /><br />I'd stick with the Redbarn or equivalent from another website.

0;I purchased 6 boxes as gifts at $21 per box.  I spent over $120.00 and none could be used.  Every piece was broken and could not be used for the Seder.  Sending a gift that is broken and can't be used is very embarrassing.  Also the return window is April 18th which is ridiculous since the matzo was for the first Seder which was on April 18th at night.

0;I had to pick up a grocery store brand after running out of our regular Innova dog food. I fed this to my 160lb dog for a week and could not believe the amount of waste this brand produced! He was going up to 10 times a day! Unbelievable! This just goes to show how much filler is in this food. Would never recommend.

0;The chicken is not organic. It is the MAIN ingredient. This is NOT organic dog food. It is marketing lies to fool you into thinking you are paying more for quality ingredients when you are not getting organic chicken.
0;I guess it does the job okay.  And it's much cheaper than 5-Hour brand.  But the packaging it arrived in was in Spanish.  Since I don't speak or read Spanish I was a little leery of this item since it was impossible for me to read ingredients and nutritional information panel.<br />The item is labelled as being made in the USA but the website on the label has a .mx extension for being a Mexican company.<br />I don't have anything against our neighbors to the south.  I just expect that when I buy something on Amazon that the labeling will be in English unless otherwise stated.
0;Formula itself is great. Works wonders for a baby that spits up but WTF... why is it so expensive here? $121 for 6 12.9oz cans. That's $20 for a 12.9oz can when you can buy a 24oz can at any store for less than $25. Almost double the price...I don't get it.

0;This is my 2nd review for this product.  The first one was supposed to be 75 words.  That would be too long for this item.  The product itself is good but the price for shipping for such a small item was ridiculous.  The package was small and light weight but I was charged $6.78 for shipping of a $4.99 item.  I have bought many items from amazon.com and it seems here lately that the shipping has gotten totally out of hand. I bought several items and the shipping was all together.  Therefore I did not know how much was charged for each item. I will not buy from this vendor again since they are making money on the shipping.  Enough said.
0;Bought this after reading the good reviews - not sure if it has to do only with my package but rice and lentil mix literally has a smell of mold. I actually opened two containers to make sure it wasn't just my nose playing tricks on me. I love this brand and I am very disappointed.
0;My baby loves this food.  At whole foods they sell the same flat for 10.99 and thats retail.  I ordered this and just received it today.  I hadn't even opened package and I could smell a rotten smell coming from box. I opened it to find jar smashed and mold everywhere! I'm so disgusted and can't believe I waited over a week for this to arrive.  What a waste of my time.  The worst part is I ordered the fruit flat as well and also a broken jar and rotten mold everywhere.  I don't get how this happens the  shipping box isn't dented or damaged neither is the flat box.  So what someone packaged and sent a smashed and rotting shipment? Not a happy customer!
0;"""I was disappointed to find out that the LIDS of Earth's Best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains BPA :(<br />I thought I was avoiding the whole BPA issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers. If it's in the lids"
0;I ordered this because I really like this brand and I have never had any issue with them.  My son usually like all the flavors.  I ordered this and the pears were sour/spoiled.  The other flavors my son refused to eat. I am sure there was something wrong with it.  So I am not sure what happened but I will NOT be buying these online anymore.
0;"""Beware of what you are being charged .... it says that it's $9.99 but 911Drugstore is charing you $39.99 plus $14 in shipping.

Amazon doesn't seem to think it's an issue since the seller can charge whatever they want for the item.  I disagree"
0;There is BPA in the lids and company claims it doesn't touch the food so it's okey. Why do they even write ORGANIC 6 times around the lid? Not honest to their costumer. I wouldn't even give 1 star if l could.
0;"""This food is phenomenal but WAY overpriced. I pay $7.99 a case in New York City and it is often on sale for less than $6 a case at BabiesRus in New York City. Grocery prices are obscene in NY so if I am paying less here"
0;"""The  reviewer from Florida  was being extremely kind in their review.<br />This gruel is not even fit for farm animals.

What Amazon has sent me is NOT<br />edible in my opinion.

0;I would never buy this cake. It looks horrible. Some of the fondant work on this seller's other cakes is shabby the piping is horrible...worse than a cake you would buy at the grocery store. The flowers look like red and green blobs. How can you possibly think you should sell these to people?
0;"""I LOVE green tea and green tea beverages. When I saw this on sale I was happy to try it. Once I received it and tasted it I was not so happy. First off tasted like the smell of dirty water. Best way I can describe it lol This has cane juice yet tastes like it doesn't have anything. Added calories for what no flavor? No Thanks. So yeah all in all pretty flavorless (beside the dirty water smell taste). Was a huge disappointment. Worse yet I bought 2-12 pk cases. Now I have to doctor the rest up. Maybe just buy some lemons and make them into a green tea lemonade? Oh well"

Also the following admonition - don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.<br /><br />Side effects can include:<br />*diarrhea<br />*intestinal cramps or gripping pains<br />*rash<br />*severe weight loss<br /><br />Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease"
0;I dont like the taste of this at all.  I have some other fennel tea from another company not on amazon and it is fantastic.  Cant remember exact name but think it is something like MB - is a french company and I got it in canada and by mail order after that.  It is much better to my taste.  Never dreamed there would be this much variance among fennel seeds as only ingredient.
0;I've read the reviews and I agree that Yuban is absolutely the best coffee but at $100 for 12 cans comes to over $8 a can.  That's $3 more a can than I pay at my local store.  I don't understand the high price?
0;"""I have never received anything like this from amazon before. The product was packed in an old used golf ball box(bizarre). The cans were all dented and old looking. The bowls were chipped up. I thought"
0;This product smells so bad that I couldn't even try to consume it.  It smells sour and rancid and is detectable even before the package was opened.  The seller has a no return policy so I'm out the $ I spent on this as it will go right into the garbage.
0;"""I have been making wonderful homemade vanilla with a recipe that I found on line using vanilla beans purchased from Williams Sonoma. I decided to try Spicy World Vanilla Beans rather than the much more expensive vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma.  Two vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma in a pint of vodka resulted in a very dark richly aromatic vanilla after only two months.  I used three Spicy World vanilla beans in a pint of vodka and after two months I had a liquid that looked like weak tea and had the aroma of alcohol.  I added three more beans and waited.  The results were disappointing"

0;"""I have a One:One Coffee Pod machine and have ordered pods online before.  These looked good and sounded like high quality coffee- albeit a little pricey for 12 pods.  This was the worst cup of coffee I have ever tasted!  It left a bitter taste in my mouth that lingered for hours.  Yuck!  Don't be fooled by the fancy name and packaging. It tastes like rocket fuel.  Fortunately"
0;You have to put a lot of sugar in  this to make it taste good. The coffee just by itself kind if has a stinky smell like a poopy diaper or a pee pee poo poo puppy in a cup. Next time I am going for raspberry flavored coffee...cause the chocolate is like poop. YUCK.
0;The advertised regular price of $99.99 is ridiculous.  5 hour energy drinks are widely available for $2.00 each.  Don't buy from sellers who inflate prices and charge ridiculous amounts.  You can get a case of 12 for $20 right here on Amazon.
0;I bought this bag and found it 50% cheaper at smart and final. It was also old and and white. This was terrible! I bought it to put in the candy canisters I give to co-workers. So I didn't find out it was OLD till a co-worker informed me. I was so embarrassed. Do not buy this candy. It all ended up in the trash. Very disappointed!
0;I don't know what all the positive reviewers here are raving about. I tried Ghiraradelli's premium cocoa mix and found it much too sweet that it was almost unpalatable. And not a very chocolatey taste either. The directions given for one serving are 4 Tbsp of the powder to 8 oz of milk.  Did they meant 4 tsp?  Using their directions would yield a total of 8 cups of hot cocoa -- not very economical for a product with so much sugar.  I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed.
0;"""I love hot cocoa and hot chocolate... and have tried many different brands.<br /><br />GHIRADELLI is by far the worst that I have ever tasted!  I honestly don't have any idea how they ever became famous for their hot cocoa.<br /><br />This cocoa has an awful"
0;"""Talk about horrible . . .<br />I was craving carrot juice and the store was out of the brand I normally like which has what I like for ingredients: Carrot Juice.<br /><br />I did see before buying that it said it had Organic Lemon Juice in it when I looked at the ingredients but I figured that the makers would only add it if it didn't change the taste that much.  Well all I have to say is I taste no semblance of carrots at all.  It tasted more like drinking a bad V-8 or something.  Then after sipping a couple of ounces I now have an acid reflux feeling in my throat and chest.  I drink water with lemon pretty often and never have that happen.  So now I'm wondering exactly how much lemon juice is in here.<br /><br />If you want carrot juice this is NOT for you.  I don't even think they should call it that . . .<br /><br />I don't normally do it"
0;The chips are awesome.  I first bought them at Costco and now I cannot get them there any more.  The bags at Costco were about 3 times larger than the one I recieved from Amazon.  The arrived mostly in tiny crumbles of chips and the bags were about 1/3 full.  I won't waste my money buying them from Amazon again as the shipping is just not up to par.  If you can find the chips retail I would advise buying them that way.  Their website says that super target and Costco carries them but have not been able to find them there recently.

Even my snack-loving toddler didn't like these. Eating them"
0;I was disappointed in the unpleasant flavor and dry texture of Nana's Chocolate Munch Cookie Bars. To me there was an odd artificial almost chemical like after taste in them that cocoa powder can't even cover up. I threw away the entire box after tasting the first bar.
0;We have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the Beneful Healthy Weight we've noticed very unpleasant results. They whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we don't get them outside in time.  Our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to 6 or 7 times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have. My theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body. Which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving.  Poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative. I will most likely be going back to Purina One.

0;I didn't like this carbonated juice.  Although it appears to be all juice (not artificial flavors) it tastes somewhat artificial.  Perhaps it tastes more like canned orange juice (which tastes NOTHING like REAL orange juice)!  I fully expected to like this as I do like fizzy fruit juice drinks.  This one did not do it for me.
0;I tried this along with two of my children and we all agreed that it tastes like spoiled OJ but fizzier. Maybe it would be an acquired taste but I won't  be drinking it again to find out.<br /><br />Oddly enough the black cherry version is quite good.

0;The Solo K-cup works perfectly instead of these.  I Totally agree with the Poor Performance review.  I also got coffee grounds in my cup everytime I used these (yes even with the filter). The cup is poorly designed. It clogged the system causing the water to back up producing a half cup of coffee or water spilling outside the top of the unit.
0;I ordered the disposa kups with the thought of making my own kups. They don't fit together without a big production. The lids won't fit and water comes out the top of the brewer lid as well as the kcup. Just a big mess. not what I wanted at all. want to return them and get a refund. Donna Phillips
0;"""I got coffee grounds in my cup 4 out of the 5 times I used these. Very disappointed because I would like to use my coffee. The hole punctured in the bottom is larger than the one punched out with the regular K-cups"
0;"""We put together the cups.  Everything went well with t he coffee into the cups along with a filter.<br />When putting the kcup into the coffee machine it would only drip.  I checked everything and it was put together correctly. I took the made up cups to my son's coffee maker keurig brand also"
0;I was really hoping that your product would solve my discontent with the Keurig coffe maker that I received for Xmas.  I am a coffee and chicory drinker so of course I wanted to have the same great coffee thru the Keurig machine.  The mesh filter that I bought first left a slimed residue in the brew....so I believed that the paper filter you created would do the job....well it does it's work properly but it is a little large for the Keurig device....so water and grinds sort of go everywhere.......I dont think your product isnt good ...the whole Keurig experience is a great disappointment!
0;These K-Cups have damaged something causing the water to not come through my already made K-Cups. I now have to put a ready made in and puncture it then open it and turn the K-Cup and puncture it again for the water to come through. I think the material in the disposable K-Cup is too heavy and damages the needle on the bottom.
0;I bought this item thinking it might be equivilent to Starbucks or Davinci Hazelnut syrup but it's not. At first it tastes like Hazelnut then you get the flavor of cheap pancake syrup followed by an aftertaste that can best be described as tasting stale. The price is only slightly better than what I can get the Davinci Brand at Sam's club but the quality is far lower in my opinion. For hazelnut fans I suggest avoiding this particular brand.

0;This is twice as expensive as basic box Mac and Cheese.  It is just so so in taste.  If you check the ingredients it is not much different than other Mac and Cheese.  The cost does not justify the ordering.  I will not be ordering from Amazon again.  The cost is much cheaper at a big box chain.

I hate to see my girl sick so I just recommend you watch your cats after you give them these treats. If not a problem...carry on.
0;"""I finally did the research on this temptation treats and I'm glad to see that my suspicions are correct. I have been buying this treats for my kitty for years and suspected them all along to be the cause of him vomiting. Ironically"
0;My one year old cat ate a few of these and seemed lethargic.  Two weeks later I gave him a large helping of these<br />and I thought he was going to die.  He laid around and would not eat or move for two days.  I will not feed him these<br />again.  Same thing happened to my parent's cat after eating the salmon variety.
0;Used for less then 2 months both cats fur began falling out bad.<br />Stopped using it & the cats fur is back to fine.<br />Back to feeding my cats Nature's Variety instinct.<br />I baught this PetGaurd product at Fairway Market not Amazon.<br />Will not use it again.
0;Nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored. I'm still not sure what flavor it is. Some type of nut. I wrongly assumed that Jamaican coffee would be similar to the Blue Mountain coffee which Jamaica is known for! How silly of me to assume that! I hate flavored coffees so I was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee. It only says flavored very small on the box so I didn't notice it before I opened it. Hopefully I can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee-flavored coffee for myself!
0;I was in a hurry and did not read the reviews...I trusted amazon's description and it did NOT indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was NOT Jamaican...it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad. I feel cheated.
0;Probably because it doesn't taste like coffee.  It is flavorless.  I saw the good reviews and thought I'd get a couple boxes and now I'm stuck with a bunch of k cups that I don't want to drink because I'd rather literally drink any other k cup I've ever tried.  As you can see I'm not a fan of these k cups.  These are the worst ever.
0;I love the taste but have found that many of the cups explode!!  The glue on the side of the cup becomes undone and then the cup explodes.  Very hard to clean up.  Do not think I will buy this brand again!
0;I bought this coffee because several people who also liked my favorite (Jet Fuel or Emeril's Big Intense Bold) liked this one. Typically Sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well.<br /><br />I am wondering if they made a bad batch or gave it the wrong label.<br />It is **NOT** bold.  It is extremely mild and smoky tasting.  Not a single member of my family liked it and that's very unusual.<br /><br />I'm going to contact the company to see if they'll exchange it or refund me.  It is THAT bad.
0;I tried a double boxes of this when the Donut Shop  coffee I usually order was unavailable.  While the coffee is pretty good the cups suck.  A full 1/3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable.  They are slow to brew(coffee maker has to work very hard) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water.  Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.  They could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee.  I believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable.
0;This was the nastiest flavored coffee I have ever had in kcups. I purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag. It smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what I expected. I will stick to gloria jeans and timothys flavored coffees. This was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last I order of his brand. I thought maybe I got a bad cup but I brewed 3 and I opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same nastiness.
0;I am not a fan of flavored coffee and I thought I had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did I see any indication that it was a flavored coffee. I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee.
0;I use to purchase Jamaica beans locally and it was great. This Jamaica me crazy is nothing close to it. The odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale. Other people in household tried it and couldn't get past the first cup. Pitched the remainder cups in the trash.
0;"""To me this coffee was extremely bitter.  I dumped it out and made a different cup.  It made me afraid to try other WP coffees but I did like the WP Sumatra Kopi Raya.<br /><br />For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.<br /><br />My favorite k-cups are:<br />Starbucks French Roast<br />Starbucks Caffe Verona<br />Starbucks Pike Place Roast<br />Green Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran Reserve<br />Green Mountain Double Black Diamond<br />Green Mountain Revv<br />Green Mountain Dark Magic<br /><br />Other k-cups I've tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel "
0;This Wolfgang Puck Coffee Jamaica Me Crazy is the worst coffee I've ever had!<br />I threw it out right away after one sip! It taste like all coconut flavoring.<br />Hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was marketable. They should be fired!
0;Ugh... no where on the Amazon page for this item did it state that it was Hazelnut flavored.  I have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it.  Thought it was going to be a Blue Mountain-like Jamaican coffee...
0;Ok...TODAY 4/15 this company decided to put them up for sale at 12.50 per 24pk...  This advertisement was on SLICKDEALS.NET<br /><br />Well... Went to order and refreshed the page and in my cart was now 1 at 36 dollars???? so they sold one out of my cart.<br />Next.... I waited 20 mins to see if it was a fluke and SD.NET started claiming dead link.<br /><br />Well upon refreshing again... they were now 44.95 for one 24 pack...<br /><br />Hey RIDICULOUS SELLER..... GET WITH THE PROGRAM ...IF THIS IS YOUR WAY OF RECOVERING QUICK MONEY...I THINK PEOPLE ARE MUCH SMARTER THEN THAT UPON PRESSING CONFIRM MY ORDER>..... ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO YOU FOR BEING SO UN-TECH-SAVY
0;"""I bought both the Creme Caramel and this Hazelnut kcup and I couldn't tell them apart even if my life depended on it... The flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too and unlike the Caramel one"
0;"""Are these people crazy or can I not multiple properly? This is $43 for 24 small cups of peaches.  That works out to $7 for the 4 pack.  This 4 pack cost about $3.50 in a grocery store in the states but because I'm deployed I'm suppose to pay $7 for it?! Not happening. Netgrocer.com is $4.00"
0;"""I of course prefer freshly made espresso but sometimes instant is good in a pinch.  I travel around Europe extensively and there are several brands available there which aren't at all bad.  This brand is OK for using it as a coffee flavoring in custards"
0;"""Good idea but the company should use a better soil compound.  Maybe darker.  It's hard to tell if the soil is wet or dry.  Present compound blows away when I water it.  Finally sprouted and I'll transpant to a regular top soil when it grows more.  At least with soil"
0;Under the product features it says all meats are sourced in the USA. I got the Lamb and Rice jerky today and it says on the package the Lamb comes from New Zealand. That's a huge misrepresentation of this product on the product page. Very disappointed.
0;This huge bag of chocolates contained old (white and cracked) chocolates that were completely melted all over the inside of the bag!  Noone at work would even touch them since they looked so sad and gross... what a waste and disappointment!  Will be wary to ever purchase from this seller again
0;"""My wife really loves O.N.E Coconut Water.  I thought via auto ship would be a great way not to have to go to the store every other day to get some.  I ordered 6 cases of 12 ea.  The first problem occurred when case number one was sent back as undeliverable.  I guess a San Diego address would be undeliverable in Kentucky.  Of the 5 remaining cases all of which did arrive but in not great condition.  All the cases were still sealed but 1 had 2 of the 33.8 ounce boxes split open and there were 3 other boxes in other cases that were stale (really had a rancid smell).  Therefore I cancelled the auto ship and have gone back to picking this up in the local supermarket.  Works out better"
0;"""Fondarific usually has glowing reviews... everyone on the cake forums seems to love it.  My batch was either old or just crap.  Very disappointing.  Will go back to making marshmallow fondant.... cheaper and WAY easier to work with.  Also bought the black but didn't open it because the white was such crap.  Had to use it because I ran out of time to make MMF for the cake I was making... DUE TO THE FACT THAT I PRE-PURCHASED fondant to use.<br /><br />I love working with Fondant"
0;These tablets hardly work in comparison with the actual berries. If you want flavor tripping then buy a box of the Synsepalum dulcificum berries or grow your own plant instead of wasting money on the pill/tablets. In my opinion.
0;"""I read all the positive reviews and thought I'd give it try. First of all it tasted stale.  Secondly I had to use 5 spoonfuls just to get any taste and then it didn't taste like the chocolate. It tasted more like Olvatine.  For the young people out there"
0;I have orderred Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Organic Breakfast Blend Whole Bean Coffee more than 5 times however the last lot I received with really bad quality. Lots of broken coffee beans and very oily. Hope the seller can check what happen...I may not try it again.
0;we switched from the advance similac to the organic product thinking it would be better as we prefer organic foods ourselves. it was a disaster with our 2 month old baby getting constipated and progressively worsening her intake till she fell drastically below her calorie intake. we discontinued the product within five days and switched back to the previous similac and she is fine now. her feeding and calorie intake is back to normal
0;"""RECONSIDER THIS FORMULA!!<br /><br />Martek advertises this formula on their website!<br /><br /> Although Martek told the board that they would discontinue the use of the controversial neurotoxic solvent n-hexane for DHA/ARA processing"
0;My child was exclusively breastfed for 4 1/2 months and I gradually introduced Similac Organic formula to supplement (my breastmilk started to dry up).  She found this was so much easier to eat she gave up on me by 5 1/2 months.  By the time I completely stopped nursing she was so constipated from the formula that I switched.  She winced and cried and worked so long to just produced a hard ball the size of ping pong ball.  It was horrible!  I realized I was the one helping her poo with nursing and then she lost all ability when she went full-formula.  I say switch....
0;"""I got a call from my mother-in-law last night thanking me for her birthday present I ordered here. She thanked me for the surprise and also had to comment how terrible they tasted. She asked me if it was supposed to be a joke on her. I said no and felt bad a 93 year old lady ate some bad jelly beans.<br /><br />Won't buy again"
0;Be careful if you have a chocolate allergy.  The last box I purchased has cocoa powder as the ingredient and the cones are brown.  I know previous boxes did not contain cocoa powder and were a normal cone color.  The distributor should market these as chocolate cones and not try to pass them off as something else.  Note:  Be especially leary since this seller doesn't list ingredients.
0;I was very disappointed with the quality of the coffee. I have purchased Blue Mountain coffee before from other places and it was always great. But this was totally unsatisfactory. It had a mildewed flavor to it like it had been stored for a long time in a warehouse that was damp or moldy. For the money I paid for it I was quite displeased and will NEVER buy from them again.
0;"""My son had this Jablum roasted and ground coffee brought back from Jamaica and paid a lot for it.  I have drunk blue mountain for years when I can but this was shocking.  It tasted stale when you opened the bag and even worse when you drank it.  It was definitely off.  He bought 5 bags and every one we tried was the same.  I would never buy another.  We had bought another brand in a tin from Jamaica which was fine.  I think this is a con.  You get all the rubbish about it being tested in Jamaica"
0;"""Lowrey's has changed it's microwave pork rinds. I used to love them. The last order I received was put up in a generic paper container with really flimsy cellophane wrapping. There is no writing on the paper sack whatsoever. The taste is sub par as is the amount of rinds. As I said"
0;"""I ordered this product - Lowry's Pork Rind - and received it promptly - within two days.  I have not been able to pop one bag!  They all stay flat - nothing works.  My microwave is not the problem as I cook lots of other things in it.  Looks to me that the product is not longer any good"
0;This is my first time and I can't eat them they are all small hard peaces with only a frw puffie ones. Is there something wrong with my batch? I can't eat them or they would break my teeth am I doing something wrong I only cook them 1 min.
0;They were very salty and seasoned with a seasoning that my family and myself did not like.  I shared with co-workers and they did not like them either.  We still have the balance and hate to pitch them but if we can not find someone who likes them that we can give them to we will.  I think they were awful
0;I was so excited when I heard about this product. I love pork rinds. But these have a nasty chemical smell and they really don't taste good at all. Don't waste your money. I actually threw the remaining 17 packages away. They REALLY SUCK!!!!
0;"""I got these for my dad from his wish list.  He thought they would be spicy and flavorful but they just tasted like cumin and had a funky smell.  The box came with 18 individual bags but after you open one bag"
0;Kind of  a ripoff.  I bought the theater box instead of the 5 piece candy bar version and that turned out to be a big mistake.  Each box has only 8 or 9 pieces and they are randomly filled so you are not guaranteed even 1 piece of each flavor.  One box had 6 green pieces and 3 black.  A better value is 20 pack of the original 5 piece bar.  This theater box is sold by weight (4oz) and not volume.  The box is about 90% empty- Ripoff!
0;This soup is very very sweet.  They left out the salt but it is full of sugar.  There is 14 grams of sugar per serving with two servings in a can.  Too sweet for me.  Also there is dairy butter in it so it is not vegan or for someone with dairy allergies.
0;Actually I can't remember a time when I tasted anything so bad. I really could not believe it was meant to be eaten. Cannot imagine anyone liking this.  It did give me a good example for my daughter why it is important for her to take her health seriously.
0;"""I received this product for free and was quite excited to try it out.  I have a child who has a variety of food intolerances and Namaste brand products have been a Godsend to our family.  Unfortunately this  Say Cheez  product is terrible and my child wouldn't touch it.  Normally"

0;"""This is some of the worst stuff I've ever tried to drink. It's even worse than that awful stuff that comes out of those machines where the cup drops down and fills it. I tried it on the various cup size settings with my Keurig machine and it just goes from bad to horrible when going from the larger size to the smallest.<br /><br />It's a complete waste of money.<br /><br />I just tried another brand that's similar and it's no good either. If you like chocolate water"
0;"""I LOVE Green Mountain coffee.  I use it all the time for my k cups.  I got a sample of the Green Mountain Hot Cocoa and thought it would be the best.  I actually threw it out.  I tried several times to drink it.  It tasted bitter and like chemicals.  I have tried samples of the other brands of hot cocoa and this by far was the worst.  I was so surprised because I adore their coffee.  I personally would not recommend this.  Maybe it is the soy I don't know.  It just tasted very"
0;I have tried 4 times to make cocoa with this product.  Twice it appeared to plug the coffee maker and would only provide about one once of cocoa.  The other two times the product worked correctly.  I do not think it is the coffee maker problem because it has made dozens of cups of coffee with no problems.  So I can not recommend this product.
0;"""I just bought a 35 oz box of this at Sam's Club yesterday for $7.87.  AND the reason I looked it up on the internet today is because it is NOT GOOD.  I checked and the expiration date on the box says best if used by Feb 16"
0;I adopted a 12 yo cat from a woman who had a premature baby with a lung condition.  She's skinny and will eat very little besides Wiskas.  I think it's Soilent Green for cats.  I would never feed this to her if she would eat anything else.  I don't think she's long for this world!!

0;I don't have any dietary restrictions.  I bought these because of an price reduction.  I wouldn't purchase them again.  They have very few chocolate chips.  Like you have to hunt for them in the cookie.  That isn't what chocolate chip cookies should be about.<br /><br />The oatmeal version of these cookies is much better.

Perhaps wrapped it in small bubble wrap and taping it securely as I've seen done with other less fragile items I've ordered. I was especially annoyed however that there is NO way of returning it!

0;Admittedly my dog loves these treats and thinks they are delicious.  However they are made in China and dog lovers in the US usually choose not to buy products from China due to prior problems with the quality control that has sickened many animals.  Dogswell should take note of this and manufacture them in the US.  It should also be noted that competitive brands on your grocery store shelves are also made in China even though distributed in California.

I am going to shop for a better product that is made here in the US . . . I have been looking at GNC products for Dogs and that is probably the route I will take.
0;I have been told by my veternarian that Glucosomin treats with chicken cause urinary problems in dogs and so I wanted to return 3 unopened packages (of 3 each)and the company will not accept returns.  Ridiculous.  They must know how bad they are for animals.
0;"""STOP USING THIS PRICEY JUNK NOW!! search  chicken jerky treats china  on google for more info and SPREAD THE WORD (some media coverage but way too little...) I am  fortunate ... my dog only suffered small amount of kidney damage-- others are not so lucky. Remember the Chinese pet food scandal of 2007 that killed 1000's of our four legged friends...TELL AMAZON  NOT TO SELL CHINESE CHICKEN JERKY.  I read that Dogswell was going to stop manufacturing in China tho dont know current status."""
0;My dog loves these treats but we recently found out these are made in China. Chicken jerkey products from China need to be avoided. I threw out the rest of these as a result.  Stay away and buy something American made.
0;After finding out whats in Beggin Strips these were recommended to me by a client.  I am a dog groomer.  My Standard Poodle had two this morning and has been vomiting along with diarrhea all day..  enough said..
0;Either I got 15 tubes that came from a bad batch lot or they are not selling the right Harissa. I bought 15 tubes thru Amazon from Parthenon Foods and used 4 of them so far and after putting the whole tube it still isn't spicy at all. Normally a whole tube would get you to sweat a bit!!!!! This seems to be a case of false representation. I buy these tubes in Canada at the grocery store all the time when I am up there and they provide a nice kick and spice (as they should). What's up with dat?
0;"""We love the Merrick lines of food to mix in with the Nature's Variety dried kibble.  Our dogs simply turn their noses up at this food and will not touch it.  They aren't normally fussy eaters.  I have one who will eat whatever you put in front of him"
0;"""I loved wintergreen Altoids!  In fact I loved them so much I stocked up last year at Easter when they were on sale for half price.  I had enough to last until this week.  So I bought a couple of tins at my local grocery.  Today I opened one and found out 1) they are now blueish in color and 2) the taste is terrible!  What prompted Wrigley or whomever to change these?  I can't describe the taste except that it is too strong and has a bitter aftertaste - nothing like the Altoids I used to love (and I had a few left today so I could compare side-by-side).  If you love Wintergreen Altoids and haven't had the blue ones yet"
0;I enjoyed these mints for many years... They are now terrible because of the changes that Wrigley has made to them.  Get rid of the color and put back the flavor.  I will not buy them again unless they are changed back.
0;I opened a can and it smelled like cigarettes which I was informed was bad bacteria.  I reported this to Amazon whom I got it from and they sent me another 6 pack for replacement BUT it also smelled badly...At this point I gave up trying. I am all for organic but this stuff was poor in my opinion.  Allot of it seemed like hard rice and it smelled like cigarettes and bad bacteria.  I wouldn't buy it again.
0;"""Maybe I'm asking too much---but I am trying to find a nondairy organic protein powder that would replace the whey protein I'm using in my morning shakes. Thought I'd give it a try-- my normal shake has the protein powder/shake mix"
0;Very disappointed in these nuts.  Horrible taste.  I got my money back and these went into the garbage.  Will not trust Azar again.  Same thing with the raw cashew pieces.  I thought they tasted toxic.
0;"""I concur 100% with the other negative reviews.  My nuts arrived rancid and were not edible.  What more is there to say other than these Azar macadamia nuts were a huge waste of good money?  Two pounds of expensive nuts were tossed out in the back yard to feed the wild life and even the squirrels would not eat them.<br /><br />I will stick with organic raw macadamias"
0;"""These Sweetleaf  flavored  products are only for people who want something really sweet with just the very barest whiff of some flavor (you probably won't even be able to tell which one it is). If you're looking for a product that's about half sweetness and half flavor"
0;I will never know how this product is.<br />Amazon/Starbucks chose to send this order with the requirement I sign for it!  Why they would do this on a $20.00 order is beyond me.  I work and am not home to sign for packages.  The package was returned and Amazon/Starbucks has yet to reply to my emails or even return my money.<br />This in my first Amazon disappointment and I have ben a customer for nearly 10 years.
0;"""I am a true coffee lover  and it is my favorite beverage morning or night.  I enjoy brewing coffee at home and buy a variety of brands in varying price points.  After reading the description of the Melitta Cafe Collection I was excited to brew it.  I was extremely disappointed by how stale the coffee smelled when I opened the bag and was not impressed by the flavor after I brewed it.  It tasted like a pouch of hotel coffee"
0;When I bought this I was hoping it would be like peanut butter but almond flavor.  Its not close.  I suppose if you can't eat peanuts this might be an alternative but I would look at other nut butters.
0;This coffee was substituted for a coffee I had ordered in a coffee club. It was $4.00 more than what I usually get and like. It was bitter(harsh) and strong. I thought it was terrible. Quit the coffee club and would not order this again.
0;After following the directions to the t I was completely unable to stomach this product.  It was a little crunchy and very jelly-like.  This was just a huge waste of money for me and very disappointing because I was really excited to think I had found such a low calorie substitute for regular pasta.
0;"""My baby is ready for some new foods in her diet so I decided to give Gerber 2nd Foods a try. Gerber 2nds is vastly different from the other brands of 2nd baby foods that we have tried. The other brands seem to be similar in consistency. There is really no difference in the consistency of Gerber 1sts and 2nds. The difference is that 2nds includes turkey"

0;"""Most of the pill pockets have arrived crumbled or partially broken.<br /><br />The problem is the pocket dough is so inelastic that it falls apart at the slightest touch.<br /><br />Pill pocket needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with a<br />pocket worthy of its name.  It can't be that hard to create a dough to form a sturdy"
0;"""Prior to ordering I misunderstood what truffle oil is... I warmly encourage potential buyers first to google  truffle oil --you'll discover that there's no such thing. The  truffle essence  put in this and other truffle oils is a synthetic ingredient"
0;I guess my palate is not as sophisticated as I had thought. I'm a rather adventurous diner but this truffle oil really cashed me out. I tried it on scallops and pretty near had to trash them. I have no idea what amuses people about truffle oil. I gave mine away (ananomously).
0;"""My daughter wanted 3 of these so she could make my 1st grandbaby her food. I bought them and then 3 boxes of the One Step reusable stackable Fresh and Freeze as i thought the latter would be better.<br />These are hard to remove when frozen and you end up touching the other sections and contaminating them. You have to run hot water over the section you want to remove. You cannot see thru the lid if you put different food in a container.<br />These are way too expensive when you can buy the other Fresh and Freeze by One Step Ahead that can go from the freezer"
0;NISSIN INSTANT NOODLE<br />CHICKEN FAVOR X 12 Packs<br /><br />The above item was sold by JVS thru Amazon.com  It written in the product description is MADE IN JAPAN. But when I rec'd that pkg of Noodle is written MADE IN HONG KONG. I e-mail to request Instruction of return twice within two weeks. NO Reply! I return it any way in the third week. They should have written Return Policy in place or reply my e-mail within 48 hrs!
0;"""I ordered this product and the Urbani white Truffle oil and it arrived broken because they shipped it in a box with nothing inside to protect it. It was just 4 glass bottles thrown into a box and shipped. Also there were no markings on the box to say it was fragile or that there was glass inside.  When I tried to go online and return it I was told the items were not returnable.  So I just bought some expensive"
0;"""I love Greek food and was excited to find this product with all the positive reviews since I don't cook a lot.  I took one reviewer's advice and bought some at Wally World at a considerable savings.<br /><br />My first (and probably last) attempt was chicken breasts"
0;"""Some of the other reviewers noted that they still had reactions to this product.  Look at the ingredients - any sort of hydrolyzed vegetable protein contains MSG.  This is a trick used by most companies in the food industry.  There are like 25 different names for MSG- or free glutamate-containing substances"
0;"""Warning to other dog owners: the edible Nylabones are extremely dangerous for dogs with a big & greedy appetite.  My dog swallowed it whole within 30 seconds of giving it to her and choked on it.  She was fully unconscious before I could dislodge the bone and breathe into her nose to bring her back to life... We almost lost her over this bone.  If your dog is a greedy chewer or eater"

0;"""I paid $7.99 for the colossal sized one I got my Great Pyrenees puppy.  In less than 7 minutes she had eaten the entire thing.  I cannot afford to entertain my dog for more than $1 a minute.  She loved it"
0;I wish I had read the other two reviews here. I picked this up at a local store for about 6 bucks. My dog just ate half of it in 5 minutes and would be done with it now if I had not taken it away. And he is only 5 months old...so an older bigger dog could destroy this even quicker. I can't believe they actually sell these...at that price at least. He absolutely loved it and is quite mad I took it away...but not worth the money.
0;"""I finally found my most favorite cookies through a dealer on Amazon.  After waiting nearly 4 weeks for them to arrive I finally contacted Amazon to let them know that I still had not received the cookies I ordered.  Two days later the cookies arrived - where they went before reaching me is still a mystery.  But I was happy to finally have them as I can't get them in Southern California.  The minimum order was 4 packages and that was okay"
0;After wasting many batches of these nuggets I finally got them to puff up properly and was excited to try some that were not still rock hard.<br />What I found was that the texture is not very appealing and they smell horrific. I know most pork rinds smell funny but these were extremely pungent and the after taste was even worse.<br /><br />I ended up just throwing away the whole bag because I was not interested in ever having that taste in my mouth again.<br /><br />Great idea. Was excited to try..  but these just fell way short.
0;"""I gave each of my two dogs one of these bones after I picked them up grocery shopping on Monday evening. By early tuesday morning one of my dogs was already throwing up (first time on my white bedding"
0;Used this piece of junk to stuff olives with blue cheese for martinis. After two olives it bacame clear that the Olivator was not up to the task. It's poorly-designed (falls apart) and much slower than stuffing the olives by hand. It cannot handle sticky material like blue cheese and then you have to clean it.
0;This product previously ordered and excellent but this time tasted old and was very hard---finally threw it away.<br /><br />Still have not figured out how I ever got it in first place as ordered another product from Amazon and somehow got this  as well?????
0;Raving reviews made me buy this for dogs.<br />I have a lab mix a beagle and 2 Shepards that I got from impoundment and they're not spoiled.<br />One chewed it to crumbles but left it on the ground and my Shepards have been burying them in the backyard.<br />I wasted my money on this one.
0;very disappointed with this product. Although the taste is good it was difficult to serve these crackers with a topping of hummus to other celiac friends. The two foil pkgs in each box does not guarantee is whole cracker. From one foil pkg. in the first box I ordered I had 5 whole crackers...the rest of the foil pkg. was broken pieces. This does not speak well for Glutino products. I will never order them from Amazon again.
0;I've tried and tried to convince myself that these crackers are acceptable but they just aren't. If you are desperate for a cracker find another. I rarely throw any food out but I made an exception in this case. It is terrible.
0;"""I read several of these reviews that state how often this product arrives damaged.  I decided to chance it and order it anyway hoping to be one of the lucky people who wrote good reviews.  The box arrived and I could see and smell the leaking creamer from the porch.  I had not been one of the lucky few.  Several of the containers had ruptured and leaked all inside the box.  If you like washing close to two hundred tiny containers of liquid"
0;I received the item and found 10 of them were crushed and spilled onto others.<br />My mother spent about 30 minutes to clean.<br />Didn't want to return as it is not worth my while.<br />Always liked this particular creamer but wasn't happy to see a lot of them crushed inside the box.
0;I just bought the Emril k-cups and have used about 12 of them and half if them exploded in my kurig machine.  It was such a pain and waste of money because I enddd up throwing them away and using. another k-cup because the coffee was full of grindes.  And I cant even write to the seller yo complain!
0;Just about 9 out of 10 of these would not work in my machine.  Its not my machine we have run hundreds of cups of coffee through it without an issue.  Had to toss most of them in the trash and clean up the mess they made.  They would just stop filtering about a third of the way then just pop and spill grinds everywhere!
0;All but a handful of the shipment were defective.  When brewing the water flowed through very slowly and large quantities of grounds were released into my cup - Gross.  The only way to use them is to empty the contents into a reusable k-cup.
0;With a variety pack I received about 7 of these k-cups. I tried the first one and it was very bitter. I let my mother in-law to try it separately without knowing my feelings about it and she said to me the same think.<br /><br />I tried over 50 different varieties of k-cups but this one definitely take the 1st place of the worst taste and the most bitter flavor.<br /><br />This is the first time I write a negative review and it is disappointing but my hope is that maybe they can do something to fix that problem with their coffee.
0;"""I have to wonder about the leadership of this company.  There's a review here from 2007 complaining about no safety seal and obviously no one at the company with the power to change that thinks it's a big deal.  I bought this at my local grocery store.  When I got home and opened it without the lid popping"
0;"""I thought this sounded like the perfect solution for taking nutritious wholesome food with us for our 8 month old baby on our vacation out of the country where I am worried we won't have very many fruit and vegetable options.  I have been making my own baby food with organic ingredients for the last 2 months.  I was excited to get the package today and ripped open the sweet potatoes"
0;I should have read more closely.  This is dried packet of mix that can be added to yogurt or milk.  Not what I wanted.  I am going to have give them away to so someone with a 'new eater'.  Missed the mark for me.
0;i was disapointed in this salt. since it is a truffle salt i expected to taste at least a hint of Truffle but didnt. if you want a really good Truffle flavored salt order Fusion Black Truffle salt it has a wonderfully strong aroma and great flavor!
0;"""I finally gave in and bought these expensive chews because the others we have used only last a few minutes. The package claims to provide  hours of entertainment  for your pet. What a ripoff! They didn't mention you would have to buy a case of these things and feed your dog a big meal of bull hide for it to last hours. I have a seventy-pound mixed breed dog"
0;Ordered Galil Roasted Chestnuts after watching a Dr Oz show.  We expected that the word roasted was referring to something similar to dry roasted.  Instead we found that they are a wet soft mushy nut.  Horrible tasting. We couldn't eat even one complete nut much less 24 pouches. Strongly would recommend that all future buyers beware of trying something in quantity that you have not tried before.
0;I have purchased these lemon drops for years and the company(Jelly Belly) has discontinued them.  I  bought what I thought was them on Amazon because they are claiming to be the ones from the Jelly Belly Company!  They are not and very disappointed they were misrepresentd as being the original...shame on you.  I now have 10lbs of junk
0;Item arrived promptly but was not as described.  It did not come with gift box packing and the plant had only 3 blooms and 1 was dead.  I requested to return and was told a replacement item would be sent.  I has yet to arrive and more than 30 days have elapsed.  Would not recommend this vendor.
0;"""I was very diappointed in this product and the company selling this product!<br />First of all shipping of this product was grossly overstated and was not anywhere near its estimated delivery time(product was 3-4 days overdue). Second of all this product was advertised as(HOT & SPICEY)an this is an overstated claim "
0;I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.
0;"""I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly"
0;I received all containers previously opened - all seals were opened. On the top of containers was decent pieces of liver and below that were grisley pieces and a lot of powder on the bottom. I will never buy liver treats from Amazon again. BIG RIP-OFF!
0;"""This jar of light coral goo is filed in the back of the fridge with  one-recipe  stuff and other exotica.  It is waiting there for me to admit that my curiosity and desire for novelty beat back my better judgement. In a blind-tasting"
0;"""This product is pretty nasty. AND you have to get three jars at once. We ended up putting one in the fridge to be ignored indefinitely and the other two will go as gag gifts. It tastes a little like the fake bacon bits that you can sprinkle on salads"
0;Save your money and do not buy this product. Does not even come close to bacon flavor more like a hickory smoke taste. After everyone in my family tried it we all agreed it was nasty(we're not picky either).
0;I should have read the ingredients list before purchasing this - they are not plain roasted walnuts or tasty roasted walnuts. I did not care for them at all. Strange combination of sugar and garlic coating.
0;I am a huge fan of Amazon and I order all the time (at least weekly) and this is the FIRST time I've ever written a review (that's how strongly I feel about these).<br /><br />I am a big walnut lover but these things are absolutely GROSS.  I opened the first can and ate the first one and thought I was going to throw up.  I spit it out and washed out my mouth thinking they were rotten or poisoned or something.  I opened up two other cans and they're the same way.  They are absolutely disgusting.  They taste stale and rotten at the same time.  I threw all six cans in the trash as I wouldn't even give those to our squirrels.  I would look elsewhere.
0;I love walnuts so I thought I would save some money and buy them here in bulk. But what an unpleasant surprise. These were horribly stale and had a very distinctive bad bad bad BAD taste. I had been told that Emerald nuts were very good and maybe I just got a bad batch(of 6 canisters?? unlikely). But I will definitely never buy these again nor will I ever recommend them to anyone.
0;"""I just checked with the Post Office here where I am stationed.  People can mail dried fruits and vegitables through the US Postal System.  I tried to order these walnuts to be delivered while I am overseas and can not get them.  My order was refused because according to Amazon  they can't ship food  overseas.  From doing some research I found that the reson they can't ship to an APO address is the vender uses either FedEx or UPS and they can't ship to an APO address.  It doesn't bother me that the vender can't ship"
0;okay this review would be about how it tasted but it never arrived at my door...i ordered it and they didnt even send it eww.this site sucks balls.they didnt even refund my money when i talked to them.ewwthis site sucks and i hope it gets shut down.VERY VERY SOON!!!! EWW!!!!!!!ps i rate them negative 1000
0;I recently started eating healthier and needed a low calorie chip to eat with lunches at work. I usually love anything ranch flavored and was excited to try the new Southwest Ranch cracker chips. Their flavor was actually TERRIBLE! I literally thought they tasted like poo. I could only force myself to eat two or three chips. I then had my friend taste them (hoping I could give away the box) and he hated them too. Now I have almost a whole box of these  that I will be throwing away. The texture wasn't very appealing either so I'm not sure if I will ever try another flavor.
0;"""My kids and I love root beer and I brew my own from time to time. Recently while purchasing some specialty versions from a local store I saw the Jack Blacks Red Dead Root Beer and thought the label was cool so I grabbed a couple. After we sampled it"
0;"""Very odd product.  Can says No GM ingredients (Genetically Modified?) but the ingredients include partially hydrogenated canola and palm oils.  Yucky source of transfats so be aware that thsi imported product contains 2g trans fat per serving...and each can has 3.5 servings.<br /><br />Taste wise - in my opinion"
0;I ordered the spotted dick. After eating I felt a little strange. I went to the bathroom and to my horror realized that I had this horrible disease. Luckily 1 gallon 128 Floz Tuscan Whole Milk cleared this up for me.
0;This is the most pitiful excuse for a bonsai that I have ever seen in my life. It consists of a twig in a cheap plastic pot. Nothing at all like the photo. I would never do business with this company again. Amazon should be ashamed for dealing with this company!
0;"""I was rather dissapointed with this product. I've had Lavazza before and remember it being more flavorful. This was very mild. It may be because it was old stock. The  Best If Used by  date on the bag was 7 months ago. I won't order it again through Amazon for fear that somebody it just getting rid of their old stock through mail order. I'll find a more reputable store."""
0;"""The coffee is good but the price is ridiculous($1.25 each K-cup approx).  You can get it from Green Mountain for 75 cents a K-cup (delivered) which is still too much. Buy it for 60 cents a K-cup at Bed"
0;Beware of this vendor.  All other K-Cups are sold 2 packs of 24 for this price.  I ordered several brands in one order assuming that these are the same 2 pack of 24 quantity and was surprised when I only received one box of 24.  Went back and looked at my and sure enough the description did not state 2 boxes as other brands / suppliers.  Beware when ordering and just pick a different vendor.
0;"""This stuff is NASTY.  I don't even think it's particularly good instant.  Why would anyone spend all that money on a keurig coffee maker in order to make instant coffee at home?  You just need a kettle or a microwave.  And what a waste of space in your kitchen and landfill.  The worst part is that you don't know it's instant until you taste it"
0;"""I knew there was something wrong when I opened the outer packaging from Amazon an it contained loose coffee grounds.  I found the Breakfast Blend box to be leaking the grounds.  When I opened it I found several of the K-cups had lids that were applied off-center"
0;These K-cups are either extremely old or they're not authentic Green Mountain K-cups. The coffee is weak and has a bad after-taste. Both my spouse and I have noticed this independently of each other.<br /><br />I tried to contact the seller to ask about this but couldn't figure out who it was.
0;"""What I received today in shipment is a joke! I have the product on the desk in front of me. I see 4 packages of Green Mountain Coffee..Breakfast Blend. The 4 packages arrived NOT in an outer box! The packages are held together with yellow strapping tape. ALL 4 packages are ripped open in one way or another. One package has the bottom ripped off almost entirely and several coffee pods are missing. This disaster of shipping  was sitting out on my front porch in 95+ heat on a very humid Texas day. Mice"
0;I have this coffee in the past and really enjoyed it. However this one I received was so weak that neither my sister-in-law or I could drink it. It was left for my mother who likes weak coffee. It feels like it's only half full so it may have been a bad box. Like I said I've really enjoyed it the past when I've purchased it at the grocery store.
0;"""Its my understanding (based on discussions with material scientists!) that nylon releases toxins when put into hot water..so..whats the deal with the nylon tea bags?  This wasn't stated anywhere or I wouldn't have bought them.  The company told me they wee FDA approved"
0;The product was good but the service was slow.  I ordered two extracts and the Shipping and Handing was $7.95 and it took over two weeks to get the product. I even contacted the vendor and didn't receive a reply. Not what I thought I was paying $7.95 for and I would bring your business someplace else.
0;"""This product is carbonated and 100% fruit juice with NO high fructose corn syrup. It has packs 140 calories in a little over 8 oz. of product.<br />I prefer my drinks with 0 calories or just plain water.<br /><br />The taste wasn't pleasing to me and it left an unpleasant aftertaste. Also"
0;I'm a bit perplexed wondering what void in the beverage market this is intended to fill.  Imagine a super sweet slightly carbonated juice drink with an almost syrupy consistency and you have The Switch.  I had to drink a tall glass of water after drinking a can of this carbonated candy in a can because it's anything but refreshing.
0;"""I find this product to be too sweet and syrupy and consequently does not quench my thirst. The size is nice but that's the only thing I liked about it. This is a subjective review of course and other's may love this product"
0;Short on flavor and not as advertised. Says no sugar but doesn't admit to the sugar found in the concentrated juices. My teens felt it was just ok with the flavor. I did not like it at all. Is it better than drinking pop? Probably but does the high price warrant the small differences?
0;"""Whose crazy idea was this?  Someone who used to work for Bear Sterns or AIG selling derivatives?  Or is this Bernie Madoff's way of getting back at us all from jail?  Why take a nice juice like Kiwi Berry and add carbonation to it?<br /><br />Not only is is toooo sweet for a refreshing drink the carbonation makes me want to lose it.  The two things you can say for it is that it's ONLY 8.3 ounces (why not 8.2 or 8.7) or 245 ml (why not 250)"
0;I did not know that Pace Mexican Four Cheese was discontinued until just now when I googled... my husband just went to 4 different grocery stores looking for it since that is one of the ingredients of one of my very best personal recipes!!  I am very disappointed that once again a company discontinued something that was JUST FINE!!! Now I have to write Pace next. :((
0;I have been using the earlier versions of this product for about 15 years. It was without a doubt the best tasting cheese salsa on the market. I have tried many other brands and they are not very impressive. When I saw Pace Salsa Con Queso back on the market I was very pleased until I tasted it. The flavor and consistency are disgusting compared to the Mexican Four Cheese and original versions. I have contacted Pace without results. I would be embarrassed as well.  I think I will take these cans and smash them against a brick wall. This is just one more sorry replacement for a good product.
0;I saw that some folks had problems with damaged cans but many more gave good reviews so I took the risk.  Turns out that 5 out of the 12 cans were dented...and I mean severely dented.  And those were all packed in the center of the shrink wrapped flat so as to hide the dents unless the can was unpacked.  I haven't tried the good product
0;I was disappointed with my order of 2 cans of Coopers LME. One can expired one month before I recieved it. The other can was newer but very dented and damaged. I will not be ordering cans of liquid malt extract from here again.
0;I bought this cat food at Tractor Supply. My cats hate this food. They won't eat it.<br />It is so hard my cat's have a hard time trying to eat it. My cats are very unhappy with this food. I would not buy again.
0;"""Yes I had the original Turkish Taffy - No this is nothing like it - The people who are writing the positive reviews are probably shills for the company that bought the brand name.  This is made with artificial flavor"
0;"""I received these bars with great anticipation.  As I have tried the same bars only with chocolate coating.<br />These bars taste horrible.  It is almost a plastic like taste.  I think the shipper did not ship them properly based upon the heat of the summer.  When I took them out of the box they were really warm.<br />Even my children who love most things wont eat them.  So either this is a terrible product or the company shipped these in the heat of the summer and it changed them.  They are horrible.<br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006JG8ALK >Oskri Coconut Bar"
0;This product is old. the chocolate crumbles and it looks old. Maybe not stored properly? I could not return item as it is a food item and could not conveniently see how to get a refund. We have had this product fresh and it was wonderful. This was not wonderful by any means
0;I would like to tell this company that the whole box of bars had melted and then it was so crumbly to eat it was a mess I don't want to spend the money to send them back it's so expensive but wish they would send me another box that was not melted and falling apart. What do you do about that?

0;I was so excited to receive this. Thought I would cut down on the calories. I didn't like the taste at all. We baked a banana bread and we threw it out. I am going to try again with brownies and add a little bit more. Maybe I just did not add enough. I thought it had an after taste though. I will still use it up and try once more.

0;This was my own fault for not reading the small print but just to save someone else my fate - these are the smallest of boxes not the movie-size boxes! I can get this product in the movie-size for $1.00 locally. This small box cost me almost doouble that. Lesson learned.
0;This stuff is just awful. Doesn't taste like chocolate in the slightest. I've had very good Mexican spiced chocolate that actually tasted like chocolate. This stuff is just a mix of cinnamon and a bunch of other overpowering spices that are not pleasant. I can't believe this stuff has such good reviews. It's iky

Research shows that people who eat a greater percentage of monounsaturated fats lower their risk of heart disease"
0;Do not buy this if you think this will substitute your current uses of PB. I love PB found nothing this mixes with well or betters the taste. I Iove Amazon but ask these 5* ratings be investigated and following up that my review remains published.

0;Tea should be stored in an airtight container. This paper bag is just folded at the top w/o any seal. Tea was tasteless. I should have returned it but I was too lazy to do so. I am sure Amazon would have taken it back and would have paid for shipping. I like Amazon but not all the products are excellent.
0;On Oct 9 I ordered from a different vendor the same product 1.2 oz- 6 pack.  That order was 6 packs of 1.2 oz ea.  When I saw this item I decided to order it.  it read the same as my first order 1.2 oz- 6 pack & the price was approximately the same.  I received the order today & what is it but 1 large bag of small packs totaling 1.2 oz.  I call this deceptive not curious as another reviewer put it. I think the descriptions should be more specfic. The 1 star rating I gave is because of the description not the product itself.  The chips are actually very good.

Over half of each package (pack of 4) the candy bars were melted and disformed in addition to them having the  OLD  chocolote white fuzzy look and funny smell.

0;"""Do not buy this! We repotted most of our plants with the soil and the one's with the soil are full of gnats. The one's that we didn't use it on don't have any.

0;I also purchased this potting soil and repotted all the plants in my home. Now I have gnats everywhere. I thought this was the best potting soil and paid more for it only to end up with gnats. Hundreds of them. I wish I had read the previous post before. Do not buy this product. Now it will cost me double to buy another brand and the work of repotting about 40 plants.
0;We repotted about a dozen houseplants a month ago with Miracal Gro potting soil. I've sprayed the soil with indoor insecticide and these little bugs just look up at me a laugh. Insecticidal soap doesn't faze them either. Let's see... Miracle Gro is a division of Ortho and Ortho sells bug spray. Conspiracy theories anyone?

0;"""I re-potted all my plants in the fall of 2010 and spent a fortune all winter trying to get rid of these bugs! I never even considered the soil.. I thought I brought them in from a new plant purchase but couldn't understand how they could multiply so rapidly. When I heard my husband clapping his hands as they were flying around his desk downstairs (where there are no plants) I went into my potting room and opened the bag. BUSTED! I couldn't get that bag outside fast enough!<br />I ended up throwing out many of my favorite plants (some very old ones) and now I'm starting from scratch. In this case I didn't get what I paid for but a whole lot more than I bargained for!<br />As for the reviewer who claims it's from over watering...I can't agree.  I've been an avid indoor and outdoor gardener for over 30 years and I NEVER experienced anything like this.  Yes"
0;I used to buy Gerber baby foods and was thrilled when they started carrying organic foods. Then I discovered that they add gelatin! Why? It is disgusting and has absolutely no nutritional value.  I will not be buying Gerber products again. Earth's Best is actually organic.
0;I liked these tubs for a few months and then realized that they contain fish oil and gelatin. Why put these products in a VEGETARION seeming food? Beware! I'm going to review all of Gerber's products carefully now. Totally dissapointed with Gerber.
0;Would give this a zero if I could.  I spent a lot of money for crackers and I believe some production error happened.  Every single bag was sealed incorrectly.  I should say - not sealed or half way sealed - all 4 boxes only had the hermetic sealing to about 80% - rest was open.  All 4 boxes were entirely inedible.  I was shipped 4 boxes of expensive stale crap.
0;Didn't not like this at all. Didn't taste good and we hated it so much that we threw all of them in the trash. I don't recommend at all. I rather stick with the old fashion oatmeal. It comes out just right.
0;This is awful tasting and for the price with shipping turned out to be $10 a bottle. Bought for my son's birthday party and some of the boys were puking and gaging it was so bad. You are better off buying a bottle of Franks hot sauce and chugging it down...at least it tastes good. This was my BIGGEST rip-off buy EVER!!!

Then I had a couple friends try a couple pieces and my assessment was proved to be correct.<br />I threw away the majority of the two pound container one hour before the trash collectors arrived so the Raccoons (which often find their way into the garbage no matter what precautions you take) wouldn't have to suffer eating it.<br />What a waste of my hard-earned money.

I don't know if the problem is with the web/computer system or if the packer simply grabbed the wrong items. As I couldn't find a way to contact Amazon my only choice was to return the items. I'm afraid to reorder as I can't be certain the same mistake will not reoccur. Too bad as the price would be good and my dog loves the product."""

0;I took a chance seeing the variation experienced by others.  The shipment that we received has such a minimal taste of cinnamon that I wouldn't say they're cinnamon if given a sample.

0;I've purchased a number of Newman's Own products for me and my dogs. This is the first time that I've been completely disappointed. Don't bother with these mints - there is very little cinammon flavor and there is a flavor that tastes something like dirt.

My elderly dog started getting hot spots and vomiting yellow stuff. I thought it was just an upset tummy. The vet treated her with antacids and cortizone creams. My poor dog has been through a lousy time.  She was drinking massive amounts of water. I had her kindeys and blood sugar checked.  She was ok there.  Last month"
0;"""We switched to Canidae ALS after the tainted food scare.  We were very happy with our choice and I recommended this food to many people.  Then they changed the formula.

0;"""My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet.  Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea.  My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks.  After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today"
0;My dogs had been eating canidae since they stopped eating their puppy food. They did great on it until yesterday we bought a new bag and they became violently ill after only eating one bowl. This was the only variant in their diet.<br />I returned the bag back to the pet store and found out they had changed their formula because ingredients had become more expensive. They did not even notify consumers!<br />My dogs have very sensitive stomachs. What they may consider a simple change made them very sick. This is a complete disregard for the dogs they supposedly care for. I understand they need to make money but notify the consumer so they can make an educated decision or buy the old formula at a higher price.
0;"""My Black Lab has been eating Canidae All Life Stages dry dog food since we switched her from puppy food to Canidae in early 2006.  Our breeder recommended this dog food.  She did well on the old formula"
0;"""I have relied on Canidae for my 4 dogs for over 3 years now. It was nice to have a maintenance food that all my dogs could eat. The last bag I purchased on Aug.4th smelled and looked different.  Almost immediately after feeding the dogs"
0;"""I had fed my dogs Canidae for about 2 months before I had problems but as soon as they switched their formula I went from happy to completely unsatisfied. Both of my dogs broke out in hot spots and they itched all the time. Like other reviews say they had chronic digestive upset and wouldn't touch the food. As soon as we switched foods all went back to normal. I also emailed the company. They emailed me back saying there was no way it was their food because their food is of the highest quality out there. It had to be my dogs. Make sure you buy a food that does feeding trials. I know some may think this is cruel"
0;WARNING !!!!!  they don't even make there own food it is licensed out to another company if you look on the back of the bag it doesn't even list who it is made by it only says guaranteed by canidae and when i asked who it was made by i was<br /><br />1 either completely ignored<br /><br />2 given a huge run around only thing i ever got was a state it was made in they wouldn't even tell me the company<br /><br />this is dangerous because this is how all the pet food recalls happened a few years ago by out sourcing manufacturing
0;"""Canidae was the best food for my lab for the last 5 years until they changed the formula in June.

0;"""If I could give this product no stars I would.  We have been giving this dog food to our dogs for years.

0;"""I am very involved with dog rescue - in fact I am a founding board member of a large and active rescue group that adopts 500 or more dogs per year while keeping very high standards with the placement standards.  We (as a dog rescue) have used Canidae for years and recommended it to many adopters"
0;My 10 month old took one bite made a face and refused the rest. She eats anything. I tried it and so did my husband. It tasted like potting soil and has a very bitter after taste. I feel like some of the veggies are not cooked long enough and thats why its bitter.
0;"""My 1 year old will eat anything...well that was until I gave him Happybaby Gobble Gobble. Immediately when I opened the package I was turned off by it. It looked and smelled awful...this does not look like tastey baby food at all. Against my better judgement"
0;"""We had ordered some of these pouches after trying some other Happy Baby products that my baby loved. These had very little flavor and my baby tried a couple bites and then started to fight me. She even gagged in the process. Bummed that I had ordered a whole box"
0;I was so hoping she would like this because it is so healthy and would be easy to take camping and out to dinner...but she wouldn't eat any of it and kept spitting it out. I gave it to the dogs and they loved it and I am sure it is healthy for them!
0;"""I believe the concept and the intended combination of ingredients is nutritious and may be delicious BUT not in this little package.  My 11 month old daughter took one bite and literally spit it out.  I tasted it and it was so lacking flavor.  I'll be making this combination for her on my own in our Beaba BabyCook.  The other fruit and veggie combinations are great"
0;"""I purchased two boxes of this because previously I had purchased Happy Baby Chick Chick and my daughter loved it.  When I opened this pouch up I couldn't believe the smell and texture of the  food .  It smells just like cat food because it's fish.  And the texture is just like canned cat food.  I have two boxes of this that I can't use because my daughter gags as soon as I bring the spoon up to her mouth.  I don't blame her"
0;This used to be a hearty and great meal for my twin girls who have both loved it since they were 9 months old but they recently changed the recipe and it is watery and disgusting now. Very disappointed. And it seems that amazon does not allow you to complain directly to Happy Baby or return the product even though it has changed. seems unfair.
0;"""My son loved the original recipe Chick Chick but Happy Baby has now changed the recipe.  My son retched upon the first bite of the new meal.  Why do companies try to  improve  upon something that already works.  I'm guessing to cut corners somehow (ie. cheaper ingredients).  It's a shame.  I now have a case of the new recipe that won't be eaten."""
0;My 10 month old baby hates this stuff!!  I've tried giving it to him on 4 separate occasions-but everytime he tastes it--he makes a disgusted look and won't eat anymore.  I even tried mixing it with his favorite foods and he just takes one bite and looses his appetite and won't eat anymore of anything for the rest of the night!
0;"""Not sure why they decided to mess with a good thing. We've cancelled our subscriptions to both the Chick Chick and Salmon HappyBaby pouches. A huge disappointment to our family as these were two go to meals in our household for our 14 month old. Please bring back the old formula"
0;I wish I had bought a single packet before committing to the case.  My baby made a horrible face when I gave this to him.  My husband and I both tried it and it has a very unpleasant and strong after taste.  We opened a few different packets to see if maybe only one was bad.  They are all the same.  Not sure what we will do with the rest of this case.
0;"""This should be called Sad Baby--it's awful. My baby absolutely hates it! I tasted a tiny bit<br />and it was bland to the point of gagging. Besides I assumed (wrongly obviously) that Stage 3<br />food--for babies 7+ months--would have some chunks of real food. Unfortunately"
0;Very surprised.  Expected it to be thicker.  My 8 month olds are not pickey eaters but they refused to close thier mouths while this food was is there.  I would try it from babies r us before buying in bulk here.
0;"""My wife's shop has a Keurig in her shop and she loved it.  She wanted to buy one and only went off visuals.  (It's black and had two cup sizes)  So to my happiness I found it on Amazon.

Brews two cup sizes  SMALL AND SMALLER.  7.25 oz and 5.25 oz respectively.  So"
0;I bought this brewer because we have one at work that is awesome.  This one doesn't brew a large enough cup of coffee.  It fills your cup up about to the 1/2 or less mark.  The K Cups are too expensive to just get 1/2 cup of coffee!  The taste of the coffee in this one is kind of a chemical taste.  Not a good cup of coffee at all.  Very dissapointed.  Now they tell me this is an item that can't be returned either.  Ughhh!!
0;Makes great coffee for about 4 months. Cheaply made product. All pipes inside are cheap plastic. Even a $25 Mr Coffee has copper water pipes in it to carry the 190 degree water but not Keurig....all plastic water lines. Heat plugs the lines up in 3 to 4 months. Piece of cheap junk made to look pretty. Save your money
0;"""These machines are prone to not pumping water and  short-cupping  (delivering too little water into the cup. Keurig likes to tell people they need to descale because that means its a user problem and not a design problem. But using distilled water won't prevent the problem. If it did"
0;I just threw out $25 worth of this and other flavors I bought from another company online. I bought because of the good reviews right here. I remember horehound being stout and an acquired taste. This brand barely has any flavour at all. If you want real horehound look elsewhere.
0;"""BEWARE! This is not the  flavor  displayed on the label of the pictured can of cat food in the photo.  This is a photo of the original formula's label.  I ordered 5 cases because the label indeed showed a photo of the label on the  Classic Chicken ENTREE with Brown Rice ..this was the ORIGINAL formula.  Friskies phased out the original formula and REPLACED it with  Classic Chicken PATE with Brown Rice  (PATE IS ON THE LABEL OF THE NEW FORMULA).<br />My cat LOVED the ORIGINAL formula.  Friskies  replacement  formula is different (texture is nearly the same"
0;I would never describe these as berry burst. They are sickenly sweet (and I have a huge sweet tooth) with a weird chemical-like after taste. These sat around the house for a month until we finally threw them out.
0;"""This is my first Bonsai tree. It is obvious it is at least 1 yr old or less and it is a baby bonsai. The seller kind of tricks you with their profile picture.

My tree goes up about 1 and 1/2 inch out the ground then curves at a right angle. I am disappointing but using some wire I should be able to make it look unique I hope.<br /><br />When I arrived home to get the package"

0;I bought the exact same thing at walmart.com last week for $8.95. Walmart sells all the flavors in the 51 oz. canister for this price. Why on earth amazon is selling this for over $20.00 escapes me. Do yourself a favor and buy the EXACT same thing from walmart.com or anybody else for a decent price. Don't get ripped off...
0;I don't understand why this is priced so high.  You can get it from Walmart online for about $10.00 (this includes shipping & handling) The product itself is great. I like the fact that I can control how much flavor I get by adjusting the amount of powder I use.  Basically the product is 5 stars & the cost is 1 star.
0;"""I'm shocked that anyone gave this product a good review.  I've used Arm & Hammer Multicat strength for years but my husband bought a box of this...

It was expensive so I managed to get it edible by melting the block and mixing it with a substantial potion of pure cocoa butter and pure vanilla.  I can not recommend this product at all.  I was shocked considering that Callebaut does make good chocolate"
0;Believe that it is not right to sell a package of 7 boxes of McVitie's Digestive Biscuits less than a month before they were scheduled to expire on April 2011.  If I had known you were going to do that I would not have bought them.<br />Please do inform your customers the expiration date when you advertisement on your website.
0;This is my second box of greenies that I have been quite pleased up until today.  I pull out on greenie and found a WORM along with larvae!! This is horrible.  I had this box for 3 months.  I emptied the box and found about a dozen more worms and was disgusted.  I couldn't believe greenies product was contaminating my dogs.  The expiration date is dated 2013 so this clearly shows that there is something wrong with this product.  I hope someone from the greenies department will give contact me to fix this.  I will be posting these comments on every doggy treat review forum/website until I hear from someone so I know that they are trying to fix it and shows how much they value their customers and product.  I don't know how long I have been feeding greenies with worms in them so my two pups will now have to go to the vet.
0;"""Bought the big box to be economical..bad choice. My dog ate one reluctantly and then never ate another--and this was over months.  I gave them to a friend.  My friend who owns a dog store said that many dogs have digestive upset with these"
0;"""I ordered 3 packs of 27-count greenie dog chews from Entirely Pets and have ordered this product from various sources for many years. I have now opened the 2nd pack and both were the same:  all of the greenies were stuck together in one big lump.  I had to forcibly pull them apart.  Although I didn't try them myself"
0;My pug almost died from this product. A piece did not digest and got stuck in his intestinal tract. He had to have emergency surgery and 3000.00 later is now OK. Any knowledgeable pug breeder will tell you not to feed these to your pug. All the company did was refund me 25.00 for the cost of the product.
0;"""I made the mistake to give a Greeny to my puppy without reading reviews about this product. It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was:  a Greenie got stocked in his intestine .<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7"
0;"""I have an almost two year old lab mix named Ares. I willingly admit to spoiling him and didnt mind getting him these over priced treats. His vet told us that his joints were in need of attention so I took it upon myself to buy Greenies treats that support joint care for large dogs. I started with a small bag to see if he liked them which he did. He was in love with them. I noticed he had a bit more gas than usual coupled with some less solid poop"
0;"""Do not buy these for your dog! I made the mistake of not researching Greenies Dental Chews online before buying these. If you Google the Greenies and how sick it may make your dog you will be shocked these are still on the market. Dogs have died eating this deadly poisonous treat.<br /><br />I saw the reviews on this product and I bought the teenies for my Yorkshire Terrier and gave it to him at night after his dinner. I figured since its for 5-15 lb dogs and his first time"
0;I ordered the Teenie pack of Greenies that was supposed to come with 96 teenie sized chews. I ended up receiving a pack with 52 teenie sized chews and 8 large chews. I returned the product because I did not receive what I ordered. Amazon couldn't replace my order because they couldn't guarantee I would get the right product if ordered again.
0;"""We purchased this syrup for making popsicles (fresh fruit and very little sweetener) some time ago based on what we now have discovered to be crap science and misleading advertising.<br /><br />We normally are very strict in our choice of foods and nutrition and are members of a group who spearheaded the research on trans fats (partially hydrogenated oils) forcing the FDA's hand for trans fat labeling.<br /><br />That group"
0;I use honey in my tea and I was hoping to reduce the carbs with this.  It is actually the opposite.  Both honey and agave have the same carbs per tablespoon and I have to use twice as much as this to get the same sweetness.
0;"""<span class= tiny > Length:: 0:19 Mins<br /><br /></span>It took my dog no more than 4 hours to destroy this.  First off there are two types of rope that this product can come with - we've seen a cotton rope or a rubber one.  Ours came with the rubber one (as shown in the x-small and small size on amazon).<br />First"
0;"""Our dog chewed through ate the vanilla infused rope.  Ropes do not show on x-rays and ultra sound.  The dog was vomiting up to 15 times a day.  Day 3 - our dog could not walk any more. Luckily our vet convinced us to do exploratory surgery and found the rope knot in our dog's intestines.  It is a very hard knot that will tear the intestines.  If not for this surgery"
0;This is a poor excuse for a dog toy . It lasted all of ten minutes . My puppy picked it up carried it across the room and dropped it on the floor and the screw off bottom that you load the treats in shattered and rendered it useless.<br />Big waste of money !!!!<br />Potentially a choking hazard if the puppy had chewed the broken pieces:{<br />It deserves no star !
0;My one year old Lab. loved the bottle filled with his kibble. The kibble fell out when tossed around. He carried the bottle into the kitchen started tossing it and it cracked when it hit the tile floor at the screw end  ALL kibble fell out and it broke into sharp pieces and it was a scramble to get the piece before he tried to eat and swallow them.  You know Labs they will eat anything halfway looking like food.  The bottle is not very durable on hard surfaces.  The same would have happened on the patio deck I am sure.  Expensive for the 30 minutes he used it.
0;I was very disappointed with the tug-a-jug.  It came in the mail today.  The dog had it for 5 minutes and she had the rubber rope chewed in half in that short amount of time.  A waste of money for me.  I have yet to find something that this black lab doesn't destroy in record time.
0;I bought a xsmall for my 12 lb dog.  My dog is unable to get the treats out and when I tried to pull on the rope I coudln't get them out either.  I also tried to pull the rope when the bottle is upside down and still no treats. I tried several sizes of treats/food to see if perhaps that would help and still no treats.  The rope in the bottle is so thick that nothing seems to fall through the bottle neck.  Don't bother purchasing.
0;My dogs play constabtly with plastic and rubber type treat toys. I have never has one break before. This bottle on a rope smashed in two places the first day I gave it to my dogs leaving jagged edges at the neck of the bottle and the bottom screw on lid. It was not made to withstand shaking and banging the toy on the ground which dogs generally do with toys on ropes.
0;"""I was so excited to get this toy for my 7 month old yellow lab.  When it arrived I filled it with kibble and soon discovered that this is the worst toy ever. It is loud and dangerous. The jug is a hard plastic that when swung around can easily bruise you and your dog and break everything in the house. In addition"
0;My 7 month old Rottweiler broke the bottom lid off within a few minutes.  The plastic is hard and when he tossed the product around by the rope it hit the ground and broke.  Now he just plays with the rope.
0;"""I originally purchased this item back in March of last year.  It worked out great with my yellow lab in dispensing a meal a day.  This version of the toy had an actual rope coming out of the jug.  After about half a year"
0;I bought two of this bottles because I liked the principle but ended up realizing that this toy was basically designed for puppies.<br />The two bottles I bought lasted no more than two weeks with my German Sheppard.<br />The main problem is that this bottle is hit on the floor and walls at the time the dog is trying to get the kibble out of it. It cracks and is basically a dangerous toy for adult dogs that will end up eating part of the plastic.
0;I bought this on the recommendation from someone that also had a siberian husky.  All i can say is that their husky must be fairly old.  My 6 mth old siberian husky is very active & a heavy chewer.  She figured out how to unscrew the bottom of the jug in one day-then proceeded to chew it to pieces.
0;"""My lab chewed up the rope in a couple hours. This alone is not a huge deal as the instructions with the toy say that a ball can be placed inside the container and have a similar effect as the rope. However"
0;"""Our Airedale Violet liked the idea at first. I sat on the floor with her and introduced her to the ins and outs of it. She just couldn't coordinate holding the jug in the correct position while jiggling the rope. She wound up frustrated"
0;"""The toy is so so. I enjoy the buster cube and atomic treat dispenser much better. The hard plastic jar against the tile floors is VERY distracting.<br /><br />The tug-a-jug kept my dog entertained just as long as the other 2 dispensers. After a while"
0;"""I bought this toy and put one of my dogs in her crate with it.  I just filled it with a handful of kibble.  1/2 hour later the Tug a Jug was broken.  My dog had chewed the end off where it screws on.  Her chewing destroyed the threads so the toy is useless. She's a 55 pound food motivated dog"
0;my dog wouldn't even touch it.  However from what I've heard other people use it. It seems way too heavy and bulky for a dog to play with and I can see if causing a lot of damage to your furniture if your dog was to swing this around.  Especially if you have a small child that could get whipped in the head with it.
0;I have a 10 pound Yorkie who admittedly destroys most toys we give him.  I thought this toy would be an exception based upon other reviews.  He has a ball that he rolls around that dispenses food and seems to enjoy it and it has lasted longer than most of the other toys.  For this reason I thought he would love this toy.  Less than 36 hours later he became so frustrated in not being able to get the treats that he tore the rope in two.
0;My dog loves puzzles and treat dispensing toys but this is the only one she dislikes. I don't really know what else to say except she's completely uninterested. Might only work for big dogs who like to rip things apart.
0;This product probably works fine at larger levels but at the small the bottle neck is too narrow to allow anything but crumbs to come through. With this sized rope and the storage available in the bottle the product would work perfectly if it had a larger opening to allow dog to pull out treats. Sadly this is not the case.<br /><br />I'm hesitant to purchase a larger one as I worry the bottle neck-rope width issue will be just as present as it is in the small.
0;My golden doodle chewed through the rope within 2 days.  I thought it was going to be a great interactive toy for him but it was not.  Clever boy chewed through the rope so that the treats poured out! lol
0;I have 2 chihuahua's and they are not at all interested in this toy.  I have tried different types of treats in it and they still care less.  Maybe it is a good toy for big dogs in a yard or something?
0;My 8 month old yellow lab destroyed the rope almost immediately.  She also watched me fill it with toys and chewed on the screw off part until she broke the cover.  Then she chewed up the bottle.  Not for the heavy chewers like Labs.
0;My 11 month old Welsh Corgi figured this out the first time she took it from my hand.  However within a matter of hours she had the rope soaking wet and chewed mostly in half.  The rope is now soft and not a useable tool to get the treat out.  The knot was also too big and frayed to let any of the snacks out of the bottle.  You should also know that the snacks this company makes are too big for the extra small bottle.
0;I thought this would be fantastic to keep my puppy busy but she just chewed the knob off the rope insert (ours was rubber) and that was that.  She won't play with it at all.  She is highly food motivated but this just doesn't do it for her.  Give her a Bully Stick and that's really something though!
0;My dog has still not figured out what to do with this.  He is a very smart dog with a vocab of about 50 words.  I was surprised how hard the plastic is and am also worried.  Once he does figure out how it works I am afraid he will knock himself out when he shakes it from side to side! Let alone what will happen if it flies out of his mouth!
0;"""This is the second  Tug-a-Jug  food puzzle I've purchased for my wire fox terrier. The first lasted about five months until she chewed through the rope. But this toy kept my dog more occupied than any other food puzzle I've tried"
0;"""this product is grainy and smells very strong. my son didn't care for it and when i tried it i didn't either. when i did further research on this product i was disappointed to learn that they use a process that involves hexane to separate the oil used in their  barrel drying ."""
0;"""I purchased the High Protein Pretzels.  I've had Newman's Own Organic Pretzels before and they tasted great - but these are not good at all.  95% of the salt is at the bottom of the bag (have to have salt on pretzels!) and they have an overwhelming flavor of being burnt and not a good burnt either!  I have no use now for all these pretzels and i can't imagine anyone enjoying this taste!<br />It is upsetting to see that a few others also ended up with the High Protein pretzels having this awful BURNT flavor and yet they still kept sending them out.  I'd think maybe they'd look at batch numbers or something to prevent them from being shipped out to dissatisfied customers who will give it a bad review.<br />Generally Newman's Pretzels are really good"
0;Bought this product as a gift for my relative in Asia but was ashamed that was told by my receiver that it has been expired 3 months ago. It a waste of my money whereby I can't make refund due to product is not with me.
0;"""This is my first review ever....I've been a Pho lover for years.....grant it I didn't expect this to be perfect....actually its so horrible I gagged...I wasn't sure if i was smelling the broth or the plastic from the container. I didn't even smell the star anise was non existent. Please"
0;I decided to deter from my usual brand and try this.  I like a strong green tea but using the same measurement I usually use with this brand was so weak I might as well have just used the entire container.
0;Delivery was on time but when I opened the product it was like the shelf life expired.  They were hard and chewy. I contacted the manufactur and they sent out a new box. I will be ordering direct from now on.
0;"""This was included in an expensive shoe stretcher package. I finally realized the reason it doesn't spray is that there is no hole in the cap. I tried to make one but was unsuccessful. I have to pour the liquid into my hand and dump it into my shoe trying to hit the correct spot"
0;"""I drink am a frequent coffee drinker - at least a couple of cups a day.  So I was glad to see this product available.  I often switch between light roast and dark roast coffee - depends on time of day"
0;"""I took one sip of this.....then promptly dumped it into the sink.  I'd rather have heartburn - or go without - than drink this bitter coffee. This coffee smelled really good in the package and while it was brewing"
0;"""Sunday breakfast - sausage and bell pepper scrambled eggs and a piping hot mug of coffee.<br /><br />This morning that coffee was the Puroast Low Acid French Roast...I received one bag to review and it had enough coffee inside to make 8 cups"
0;"""I love coffee. I love the scent of it when it brews. I love the taste with a bit of cream and some sweetener. I love it and I drink a lot of it. I've tasted everything from high dollar gourmet blends to cheap supermarket standards just to see which I prefer the most. I'm sometimes as finicky about my coffee as a wine connoisseur is about a robust pinot noir.<br /><br />That's why"
0;I am GF and appreciate any/all efforts towards new foods but this is dull stuff.  Making your own granola is super easy and takes very little effort.  I'll take my $6 for this weenie package and head back to the kitchen.
0;Healthy Choice Lunch Express meals are terrible. Not healthy. Packaging and marketing and yet MORE plastic to choke the planet. The calorie count is reduced because the box is full of AIR. Make your own lunch.
0;"""This product is terrible.....REALLLY!!!  It taste like dog food.  I fixed one and could not eat it.<br />I threw it in the garbage. (it was that bad) I wasted 28 bucks.<br />I did not want to spend another dollar on this product"
0;I eat healthy choice most days for lunch and this one is the worst.  I no longer buy it.  It is flavorless (unless you add a packet of soy sauce).  I don't even think this one will make it into my earthquake food kit.
0;I really wanted to like these after reading all of the good reviews.  I am not a cheese snob.  I like Baked Lays with cheddar flavor.  But something in the flavor of these cheddar Popchips is not right.  The first bite is OK but then there is a bitter aftertaste.  Too bad.  Back to Lays!
0;I have ordered my Pop Chips from Amazon for months. The last boxful was nasty. My whole family agreed and we threw them out. They tasted old and rancid. I wrote this to Amazon and never heard a word back about it. I just cancelled my regular delivery.
0;I just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received! AGREE. I ordered the Sea Salt&Vinger packs and am very disappointed. Ver weird Vinegary awful taste. The salt and vinegar especially tasted gross! I took one bite and had to throw the bag away. Agrre. Now I'm stuck with a bunch of 23 bags of chips that I'll never eat.
0;"""I read about these on [...] and decided to try them.  I bought the variety pack so as not to get stuck with one flavor if I didn't like them.  I really tried to like these because of the health benefits but I ended up throwing out the whole case after tasting one of each flavor.  If you are looking for these as a substitute for potato chips"
0;"""I gave these treats to my chihuahua mix and he developed renal failure.  I then found out the FDA had issued a warning about these treats causing renal failure.  I'm amazed Amazon is still selling them.  My dog just spent 2 days getting IV fluids at the vets and may still not survive.  Yes"
0;For Tulsi Original Decaffinated Tea the price is outragious for 1 box -- over $16.00!!!!! Rip off!!! What's the difference in cost for regular caffeinated and decaffinated to make the price too high. I don't get it.
0;"""How can this be  healthy  when it's made with modified corn starch and high fructose corn syrup?  Ick.  Any  food  that includes meat but needs no refrigeration is not actually food.  If the word  Healthy  is in the title"
0;"""We drink a lot of tea... from all over the world! By far this is the worst tasting tea we have had... I purchased this based on reviews and because this is organic. When compared to st dalfour organic tea... this tastes like Lipton caffeine free tea from Costco! I HAVE always gone with reviews before buying anything online"
0;"""I HAD TO THROW  THE WHOLE BAG TO THE GARBAGE CAN. I TRIED AND I TRIED TO MAKE MY DOG EAT IT BUT HE REFUSED. I AM TRYING NOW THE NATURES VARIETY RAW FROZEN FOOD RABBIT  AND THANKS GOD HE LIKES IT. I ALSO FEED HIM RAW PORK  FROM THE SUPERMARKET. MY DOG LIKES FRESH RAW MEATS NOT DRY MEATS. HE ALSO EATS FRESH VEGETABLES LIKE TOMATOES"
0;My 2 year old Cindy has developed an allergic reaction to a new bag of this Purina cat chow indoor formula food. She has been throwing up all over the rugs and floors when she used to be so careful about cleanliness! I am starting to suspect quality control. I will never buy this product again.
0;I've tried 3 different recipes with Carbquik.  I used it to bread chicken- just barely ok.  The biscuits I tried were terrible.  The dumplings for chicken and dumplings were a mess.  They didn't hold together when I put them in the boiling chicken broth to cook.  I had to pitch the doughy mess and order dinner out.  The mix its self has a peculiar odor that is unappetizing.  I wouldn't recommend buying this product.
0;"""I used this product under the belief that it was really better than regular flour. Guess what. It isn't. Go to the isle on your grocery store and you will see that there is about a 5 carb/ 20 calorie difference between this and regular wheat flour. NOT TO MENTION"
0;"""I was surprised when I opened the box and found that some of the K-Cups were not properly sealed.  Coffee was spilled all through the inside of the box and some of the K-Cups were obviously unusable.  This is the first and last time I buy this brand.  Although the coffee tastes ok"
0;"""There IS a difference! I was under the impression this was a chocolate flavored coffee with raspberry undertones. It's the opposite. I hate the raspberry flavor because it makes it taste like cough medicine. I tried mixing it a hot chocolate mix but it didn't work. That raspberry flavor is very overpowering. Also"
0;These K-cups arrived in a timely fashion but when I've tried using them at all 3 size settings none of them are strong enough. It seems there is not enough coffee in them. I wrote a complaint to Van Houtte and they did not respond...So I've got nearly 50 cups that when brewed smell like chocolate raspberry but taste like water. Not happy.
0;"""The idea of creme brulee coffee sounded so delicious.  It took a week and a half to get here so we were REALLY looking forward to trying it for the first time.  How disappointed we were.  There's absolutely nothing that indicates a creme brulee flavor or even anything with a slightly sweet (or sweet smell).  This is a smokey coffee and I think that makes a difference.  There's a somewhat nice aftertaste but it's nothing like we'd expected.  Now I'm pouring sugar and cream"
0;"""I have been drinking this Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee for quite a while and recommending it to all my friends.  I LOVED it!  My first conscious thought every morning would be of that great-tasting cup of coffee.  YUM!  So what happened to it?  The last few boxes have been absolutely tastless :(  There is no wonderful aroma either.  I might as well be drinking hot water.  This is SUCH a disappointment.  That wonderful flavor is now only a memory.  Sadly"
0;"""I LOVE chocolate and adore raspberries (Godiva Dark Chocolate Raspberry Truffles were my idea of heaven).  This coffee has been a major disappointment.  I drink a lot of flavored coffees and decided to try this one due to the rave reviews and being a combo of two of my favorite flavors.<br /><br />I've gone through one box"
0;I bought this product to keep my boxer entertained. She is very food motivated and very smart. The problem is that she tries to get the food out by any means necessary. This results in her being very ruff on the toy. I had to take it away for fear that she would break it.
0;My puppy just preferred to eat the toy than the treats. My older dogs were curious but did not do any thing. However the red plastic is pretty stong. My dog has been chewing on it for a few days. So if anything it gives your dog something to chew on other than your shoes.
0;"""Product arrived damaged and smashed up because packaging is cheap and inadequate to protect milk containers.  Milk was leaking out of box.  I tried to return it but found out that this stuff is non-returnable.  So if it arrives all beat up and leaking your stuck with it.  Given how expensive it is"
0;"""I bought this coffee because I have acid reflux/GERD.  It says it is coffee and it is low acid.  I made three pots in a very good coffeemaker and nothing I did improved the flat nothing taste of this coffee.  It also was no better for stomach irritation that other coffees I have tried.  I took a chance when I bought this coffee because it is non-returnable.  I have spent less money for much better tasting coffee.  Amazon seldoms disappoints me with the quality of their products.  Healthwise Gourmet Coffee"
0;This stuff was awful. It tasted like water soaked in Cherios-except the Cherios had a better flavor. This mud had no coffee aroma or flavor! My stomach was still aching so I really dont know how low acid or decaf this sewage was. As an unexpected bonus I also got a terrible headache.What a bunch of crap!
0;This product makes it sound healthy having 50% whole grains in the pasta however the part that everyone should be aware of is the 3.5g of trans fat. Trans fat is chemically made to prolong the shelflife of products and it is not good for ur health. Eating this each day is unhealthy due to the enormous amount in each serving. I suggest buying one that contains 0 or at minimal .5g trans fat if u must.
0;"""My westie and yorkie eat this canned food and I thought I might find it slightly less expensive on Amazon.<br />I found this one and saw the picture of the large dog food which is normally what I buy at the pet store.  It appeared cheaper by a little after considering the shipping cost.<br />I was very disappointed in finding out after shipping cost I actually paid .54 cents more than my pet store!  But then it was worse!!! The cans were more than half the size of the picture!  I contacted customer service and told them I should have read the description"
0;We use instant mashed potatoes a lot but these - I'm not sure what these are. The taste is horrible. Cannot describe it short of an almost spoiled sour cream taste. Off to toss the rest of the packs because they are truly that bad.
0;I love mashed potatoes. But I goofed on this batch. These are much too highly seasoned for my taste. Betty Crocker tried too hard to be distinctive. If she had let the poor reds be themselves they would have been wonderful.
0;These taste synthetic. There is a big difference between mashing your own potatoes and the contents of this package. The second ingredient is powdered cellulose and that's what they taste like - something that just can't or shouldn't be digested.
0;"""I totally agree with the reviewer who said this mayo is wayyy to hot!! I bought this mayo for my boyfriend who loves pepper with his sandwiches. I was alittle skeptical because I like pepper but not alot. So I reluctantly bought this because I really like the regular olive oil mayo.<br />I was the first one to try this mayo. I had made me a club sandwich with turkey"
0;"""If you love mayo and a touch of black pepper then this is not for you. You are better off with just your regular mayo and adding your own sprinkle of pepper. This stuff is downright hot. There is so much pepper that you can not taste the mayo. The mayo flavor is lost even if you only use a little bit of it. However some like it hot"
0;This Mesquite Lime flavor is so horrible! Please spare yourself from the disgusting mouth experience. The other flavors are pretty good. This is like some nasty fake lime flavor that is super overwhelming. Am I eating Lemon Pledge or something? Couldn't finish one bite. Hope I don't chuck.
0;My son really wanted these as he loves the other flavors. But They are DISGUSTING!!! Too much lime :(  So bummed I bought a case and can't return the unopened 23 we didn't touch and do not plan on touching.
0;The cups came in a brown paper bag that was crumbled like it had been used several times.  The receipt I got said 24 K-cups and this site said 22 K-cups.  Disappointed.  I purchased this for a gift and it looks horrible to get as a gift.
0;"""I was really looking forward to this salt substitute but it falls far short in my opinion. Tastes like a glorified version of Mrs. Dash and far from salt flavor. If you want something really good try Himalayan Pink Salt sold through Amazon --- it's outstanding !!!! I purchased the one with the grinder and it could not be better. Yum "
0;It was awful and didn't really taste like barbecue sauce at all.  It had quite a sour flavor.  I actually really enjoy intense flavors of all different kinds of spices but I actually threw this bottle out after trying it.  Don't waste your money.
0;"""I recently purchased the On the Go Yamamotoyama Sweetened Iced Green Tea and was floored!  I bought it at a store that is far from me.  I was told I could find this brand at Ralph's. But when I went I could only find the Raspberry flavored one.  It was absolutely horrible compared to the one I had earlier"
0;"""I had recently tried Pocket Coffee a friend brought back from Italy. And it was one of the best chocolate I ever had! I searched and brought this product at Amazon... but I am extremely disappointed... This is not the same as what you can get from Italy.  Instant Maxwell coffee  in the middle of  Hershey's chocolate  just doesn't compare with the real thing..."""
0;The claim that this is the best vanilla flavored coffee I have ever had is JUST NOT SO.  This product does not even taste like good coffee.  It does not smell like vanilla and does not even taste like coffee.  It is overpriced and terrible as far as I am concerned.
0;No doubt this is great if you are on a diet and need sugar-free but this stuff taste so artificial and the coloring is way too strong. The sweetness leaves a strange unbearable aftertaste. I'm stuck with 20 tiny boxes and I don't think I'll order these again.
0;"""I would never ever ever buy this gum again. Not sure what extra was trying to accomplish here but I'd advise you to buy a pack in store before purchasing it in bulk. I am a GUM LOVER! I wouldn't chew this if it were free. It tastes chemically"
0;"""My parents are both diabetics (Type 1 and Type 2). Their blood sugar has been uncontrollable and was looking for a healthy alternative to Splenda.  Bought this last week at Whole Foods in Northbrook and it was on sale as well.<br /><br />Love the smell"
0;If you expect this to taste like dr peppeper you will be very disappointed like I was. Sad to say but this product really needs a taste review before they offer it to the public. Do not bother with it.
0;For the price this product has NO truffle characteristics at all.  I could have been eating black pencil shavings with more flavor. Also the can was only a third full. I realize this purchase is by weight but the use.a smaller can to preserve any integrity of product.  Overall a disgustingly overpriced disappointing purchase especially with expectations for holiday meals when purchased.  Do not order. For all I know I received lack dyed leaf scraps.
0;"""I purchased this as I wanted to give my baby an organic alternative to cereal found in supermarkets. I thought is was such  great idea to have multigrain cereal just like what I eat.<br />BIG MISTAKE.<br />This gave my baby the most horrible gas and it took me months to realize it was the cereal causing this. Only when my mother-in-law said  Boy"
0;Opened a can that's not set to expire for another year and it was awful and rancid smelling. Rancid grains are toxic and it is terribly irresponsible of them to let this problem persist in food made for babies!! I won't buy their products again.
0;This was the first time I ordered this brand. All six cans were rancid. I wasn't as lucky as other people who can return them as I didn't open them right away. I will never buy products from this company any more.

0;All rice cereal contains arsenic which may cause cancer.  Check with your pedeatrician and see if you can switch to oatmeal instead which this brand carries as well. You can google rice cereal and arsenic for more information.  I will not be feeding my baby any rice after reading about arsenic.
0;This was the first time I ordered this brand. All six cans were rancid. I returned them right away and canceled my subscription. You would think baby food products have a better quality control but I guess some companies do not care.
0;"""I purchased 3 containers of this cereal all having expiration dates in 2012.  The first container I opened seemed fine (at least I hope it is! I fed it to my 5 month old!) The cereal color was a pale whitish-tan and there was relatively no odor to it.  Baby likes it so I am happy.  The second container I opened (again"
0;"""I purchased this cereal because it appeared to be very healthy and promising. But once I received it and after smelling and tasting it i knew something was wrong. I know a rancid smell when i smell it. I would not feed this to my baby. I tasted and it left a terrible after taste. I called the company and read other reviews on this defect. The company says since there is less fat in this specific product"
0;"""Tried one and it was horrible.  My son is 11 months old and have been eating cereals for a while (mix of Earth's Best and Gerber organic).  This is the first one that he doesn't like.  When I first opened the can"
0;I bought this because I was looking for something with probiotics.  I have purchased a similar product from Plum Organics (contained Pro and prebiotics).  I have purchased several items from HappyBellies before and have been pleased with them all.  I ordered this despite the reviews from others that commented on the rancid smell.  I assume this has to do with the added DHA.  I bought 6 containers.  Opened all 6 and they ALL smelled rancid.  I would never feed this to my child.  Ended up contacting Amazon because there was no return available for this product.  Save yourself the hassle.  Buy Plum Organics Multi grain cereal.

0;I love this brand and my baby loves the oatmeal cereal.  But I decided to try the multigrain and NEVER again.  My baby hated it & I didn't blame her because it smelled really stale.  Try the oatmeal cereal & forget about this one!!!

Ever since I gave my 6 month old this organic oatmeal cereal (which she seemed to like with my breast milk) she has been constipated. Day no 4 and I am still waiting for her  full diaper ! I can see how much she is suffering trying to poop"
0;This is a copy of the email that I just sent to the avoderm company:<br /><br />You changed your formula for the vegetarian dog dry food a few months ago.  The smell was completely different. After a few months my dogs developed MALNUTRITION!  You should be deeply ashamed of your negligence.  Vegetarian dog food must be of the highest quality and carefully monitored for it's value..  I will let all dog owners know of this horrible experience.

I do not have the lot numbers I need to determine if my bag is on the list.<br /><br />Please forward that information as soon as possible. Thank you.
0;I learned today that this product and the previous bag I bought were recalled due to Salmonella. I just happened to stumble across the article on MSNBC. No notification was sent. Now the household's mysterious stomach flu isn't so mysterious. Also if you don't have your receipt they will only offer a coupon for replacement in 6 weeks.Why would I want another bag?!?

0;These sellers do not want to give me my money back i purchased this item and it said pack of 4 accross the top of the box with an arrow and in the description. The cakes are great but i ended up spending a total about 40 dollars for this thing. I a purchased them for about 4 dollars at big lots a few years ago. I'm working on getting my money back but i suggest you be aware of what you are ordering. It isn't a pack of 4 it only 1.

This is probably the last time I will do business with AMAZON or ANY of it's so called merchants."""
0;"""You'll LOVE this!  It tastes like medicine.  It even coats your mouth the way medicine does.  I absolutely love sparkling water of all types and think this is completely awful.  It's not even like yummy grape-flavored cough syrup"
0;This is basically seasoned paste in plastic tube.  It does not cook well on it's own and is only good as an extra flavoring.  The taste seemed a bit weird to me.  It tasted like plastic.  Gross!!<br /><br />Save your money and just get some good quality spices to add to your meal.
0;I just received this and I expected this to be Decaf regular unflavored coffee.  This actually is a variety pack.  It has multiple flavors and I am not a fan of the non-decaf version of these flavors.  I will be returning...
0;"""BUYERS BEWARE - I guess it's my fault I really thought when I ordered this coffee I was gettinng TWO BOXES of coffee for 22.50 like almost every other coffee dealer on Amazon sells this stuff for. But this guy sells this coffee for 22.50 for ONE!!!!! box of coffee.When it arrived at my house I asked my wife where the other box was and she said:  Thats It just one box arrived!  I looked my order over and sure enough he does sell it for 1 box of coffee for 22.50 making this probably the MOST expensive k-cup coffee on Amazon. So shame on me for not looking the order over before I purchased it. If you look at all the other sellers"
0;Very dissappointed to find out I only get 1 box of 24 KCups. Almost $1 a cup. I usually get 2 boxes for this price. CRAZY!!! I buy these online because they are much cheaper than stores. I did not receive the right flavor and shipping seemed to take very long. Not happy!!!
0;"""I thought I ordered a bold decaf but this is what was delivered.  I opened one to try it out and do not like it but am now stuck with it because I opened the box.  This product needs to be labeled properly and CLEARLY.  If you like a mild roast"
0;I ordered two boxes of BOLD Roast and instead I received Light Roast. Now I am stuck with what I didn't want. The BOLD roast is perfect and it is my favorite coffee. Wish there was someone I could complain to about receiving what I did NOT order.
0;Not good coffee at all - I thought I was buying the donut shop decaf (which is awesome ) but thought ill give it a try instaed of shipping it back ... it has a terrible chemically / stale  type aftertaste. Donut shop is WAY better.
0;"""This is not Decaf  Extra Bold . Something is wrong with the computer or the person shipping the product. They have sent Decaf  Light Roast  twice in place of Decaf  Extra Bold . This really needs to be fixed. I sent back the first order. The second order they decided to overnight to me to make up for the mistake. I know the second time it also said Decaf  Light Roast  on the box"

0;For some reason Merrick thinks this product is worth double now! I bought two 8 lb bags early September and came back to buy the next batch only to notice the price has been hiked a whole 100% from $8.xx to now almost $17! Just gonna transition my dog off this brand and move on to another Company that actually has consistency in pricing!
0;"""I enjoyed my Manicardi #8 vinegar I bought in Italy. I thought I was buying and even better quality with this product as it is advertised as #12. I was able compare them side by side and this #12 is not close to the same good flavor. I did some research and found that it is actually a lower quality cleverly described by the manufacturer as a 3 barrel formally #12 to confuse the buyer. The description is correct per the manufacturer's label so I can't say that olio2go has a deceptive advertisement. It points out that it is actually  grape must  and a condiment quality. But including the #12 designation does mislead. So I gave it one star based on the easily confused product. It was not what I was expecting so I am unhappy with the result. Others may enjoy the flavor but the real thing is much better."""
0;It was not specified on this site and I did not know until I received the product.  This is something that should be clear on the product page especially since the FDA has specifically warned about chicken jerky products for pets that are made in China.  I am going to ask for a refund.
0;"""I cannot tell whether this product is good or bad since it is nigh impossible to get much of it out of the tube.  I even put it in one of those tube rollers used for toothpaste and it still does not want to leave its  home.  I have run it under hot water and that did not work.  My next plan is to take my box cutter and cut it open!  The person who  thought  this should be in a tube"
0;I read all the reviews before purchasing. Just received the mini sprouter tried to start using but the water keeps leaking out the sides.  Not sure what i could be doing wrong since its only 7 pieces that stack.  Very disappointing!  Returning this ASAP!!
0;Was looking forward to this. What a disapointment. It was stale. I didn't even try to return because I was just that fed up and looked at it as a lesson learned. Trust you me this is not the first food item I ordered on line nor was it the first stale one. Lesson learned is don't buy food on line anymore.

0;"""I agree with the others' comments about buying from Amazon.<br /><br />We've ordered these chocolates before directly from Lindt and they've arrived in perfect condition - crisp shiny shells that SNAP when you bite into them"
0;I guess it's my fault for ordering chocolate online... but these arrived completely melted. I am not sure whether I can return this or not but I was really looking forward to eating these. I ate samples at the Sony Ericcson Open this year. And watching the Roger Federer airport commercial on TV made me really want to get these. I got so excited when I got the package only to be super disappointed :(
0;My dog does not touch this stuff. The paste is messy and not something you would let your puppy play with in the house. I did try freezing the Kong toy but as soon as the paste thaws it oozes out of the toy and creates a huge mess. He does like the Kong Toy without the paste.
0;My puppy Paw Paw hates this stuff.And I hate it to. It get's my whole house plus the inside of the toy stink. And my next door neighboor dog Fluffy the Bichon frise ate this stuff one time and ended up in the emergenciey room! But she is better but needs to rest for a couple days.

0;"""I will never order from this person again. They took what would be 1. pig ear and cut it into 3 very small strips. Instead of my dog getting one full pig ear he got  strips of a pig ear. What was even worse is that I got 25 pieces of the strips which was equivalent to maybe 8 full size pig ears. I'm sticking with Sam's or Costco. This place ripped me off by charging $17 bucks for strips instead of a full ear.  Additionally"
0;"""These USED to be whole pig ears two years ago.... but now?<br />They are just pig ear pieces!!  What a total RIP-OFF!!<br />What is next?  Pig ear  chips ??<br />This is an embarrassment to the marketing industry... cheating<br />the customer.  And"

I would be interested to see a chart of their sales before and after implementation because their responses to the long time consumers is that  product testers  like the new formulation.

0;I'm 35yo and I remember eating this stuff for breakfast all throughout my youth.  I loved it.  Loved it to the point that there were days that I would eat it for breakfast and dinner if I could get away with it.  For some reason I stopped eating it.  I saw this and decided it was time start it up again.  I'M SO DISAPPOINTED!!!  The flavor is completely different.  The end product is soupy and letting it sit for a bit doesn't help.  The portions sizes do seem like they might be a bit bigger but that's the only good thing I can come up with.  It might be a healthy choice but I think I'll just stick to my fresh fruit breakfasts.  This is just bad.

0;This arrived today. The packaging was sealed but after opening the package I found that the cheap plastic cover was totally off the Tamarind Paste and the seal was even broken. Obviously I won't be eating it.
0;I would not purchase this item again.  It has some sort of scent or perfume added which is not only very noticeable but unappetizing. No listing of any additive of that sort on the package except aromatic spices and I doubt there is anything in nature that smells like that. Packages are marked 'Product of China'.  I have had no problem with Lee Kum Kee sauces that I purchased in the past.
0;This has a strongly bitter taste of lime when made as directed.  Definitely not a natural made from scratch taste.  It made the worst tasting Margaritas that I've ever had.  My initial response is to just pour the rest of it down the drain and cut my losses.  I'm glad I only bought one bottle to try.
0;I don't know if I got a bad batch or what.  About 1/4 of the bag doesn't pop and the flavor is absolutely horrible.  The smell of the unopened bags is putrid like it is very old and rotted.  I bought 2 boxes to give as Christmas gifts and am extremely disappointed with my purchase.
0;Very disapointed with this product.  They really have a terrible taste to them.  This was my first time purchasing this product  Through Amazon and I will never do it again.<br /><br />Here are the big issues with the product overall.<br /><br />Super hard<br />taste like salt pellets<br />no spice flavor<br /><br />I really could not even get through one serving.
0;At Sam's stores you can buy the 175 count for $12.98.  My restaurant customers LOVE these with their guest checks! Guess I am taking a trip to Sam's. Sorry Amazon.  I will remain loyal and use you for all your other great deals though.

0;It is unfortunate that the wording of this item description doesn't make it clear that this is artificial flavor. Real vanilla is always brown because vanilla beans are brown. The artificial vanillas are by-products of wood processing and contain petro chemicals.  Do your taste buds and body a favor - use the real stuff even though your cake/frosting will not be pure white.
0;I AM NEW TO THE GLUTEN FREE COMMUNITY. I HAVE TRIED TO FIND BREAD OF ANY KIND THAT I CAN EAT. BREAD THAT IS CLOSE TO WHAT I AM USED TO. I CAME ACROSS CHEBE BREAD ON LINE AND THOUGHT HEY THIS MIGHT BE OK. I WAS WRONG VERY WRONG I'VE TRIED TO USE TWO DIFFERENT BREAD MIXES WITH ABOLUTELY NO SUCCESS.

0;The ingredients say Green Tea Matcha powder.  There is no mention of sugar in the contents.  This is a product that contains sugar.  NOT GOOD FOR DIABETICS or people who can not have sugar.  Also the color is not bright green but more of an olive/tan color.  This product description is very misleading.  I will return to the 100% organic Green Tea Matcha powder from Eden Foods which I have purchased in the past and was extremely happy. BUYERS BEWARE!
0;"""Initially I was so excited to find this gift basket - it  seemed  perfect for a reasonable price.  I received the product today and was terribly disappointed when seeing it.  Honestly  it looks like yunk that you MIGHT buy for $12 to $15 but CERTAINLY NOT $50!!  I will be sending this back ASAP and recommend that others do not waste their time and money on this cheap"
0;The product will not dissolve!!! And it tastes OK (drinkable) but more like cool aid or orange soda even when added to orange juice. I cannot speak to the effectiveness of the product as dissolving is vitally important and it has a problem with that. Appears I've wasted some money.
0;The people who make this have no taste buds. This does not taste like berry flavored anything. Nor any actual berries I have ever eaten. It tastes horrible. I have had some other flavors and they are fine. But this one is pretty bad. No one I have give none too (likes the taste of it either.
0;"""I purchased two orders of these as gifts because it looks attractive in the photo and there appears to be a reasonable amount of nuts.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Turns out there is very little nut meats in this product.<br />The illusion was created by the the cellophane (wrapper or bags) folded underneath the nuts.<br /><br />I thought it was odd there weren't many reviews of this product"

0;I had high expectations but it was extremely salty and tasted nothing like movie theater popcorn. Next time I try popping it ( I do have 23 more packs to go through) I'll try cutting back on the salt in the packet. I don't know how this popcorn got such ratings. I'll give it another shot though out of the love I have for popcorn.
0;I was excited to receive my movie theatre style popcorn.  I was extremely dissatisfied when I received my item because it was OLD!  The oil was completely dried out & the popcorn barely popped and tasted very stale.  I feel like I wasted $17.00!
0;"""I recently purchased this popcorn and less than half of the popcorn popped.  And those that did pop were tough. I believe these were old.  I've purchased other brands and they all have an expiration date printed on back each pack.  These had no expiration dates printed"
0;"""We are disappointed with the Great Northern popcorn for our new machine.<br />It seems stale.....and 'chewy'.<br />We have a popcorn machine up north and it pops beautifully and tastes like theater popcorn.<br />However"
0;"""I ordered this popcorn based on the glowing reviews. It's possible that I received popcorn with an expired date but have no way of telling from the packaging. Food is not allowed to be returned to Amazon so I am stuck with over 20 bags of corn kernels that are inedible. Followed the directions exactly and popped the corn in my new popper"
0;After making several batches using different techniques I can only get 50% of the kernels to pop.  I used a different brand of kernels with much better results.  The only conclusion I can come to is that these packages are stale.  It doesn't help that there is no expiration or manufacture date listed anywhere on the packages.  I would recommend to not buy this product.
0;Smart and Final Has 36 8oz for $22.50. And remember don`t sign up for the get $40.00 if you sign up for a Amazon credit card. It`s a rip and the phone will start ringing from the people they sold your phone # tooooooooooo.

0;I just bought a new Great Northern 8 ounce Popcorn Machine and I bought the 6 ounce packs and 8 ounce and both taste chewy. This popcorn seems to have a lot of moisture in it because all the windows tend to steam up really good. I also tried leaving the doors slightly open and metal try completely open which helps with the steam but the popcorn still comes out chewy. I'll try ordering a different brand.
0;"""I read all the reviews before giving in and buying. After all the comments on how good this tasted I really expected to like it. For the price it better be as good as the reviews claim. I was completly dissapointed. So far I have tried 3 bags"

0;It was a real pain to throw out the whole bag.....but it was too disgusting to open.... beware. I am a huge fan of Kirkland products-but this was not worth opening to try.  My local Costco doesn't sell this.
0;"""i've ordered this several times.  each time it arrives with the bottom 1/3 of the package just dust.  for this price i would think the majority of the bag would be whole pieces.  i've complained several times"
0;"""I expected this product to be similar to those sold by Mrs. May's. What a disappointment! They are very salty. Imagine taste combination of salt and sugar. The bag is going back to Costco. I would not eat another piece"
0;I'm currently eating a very low carb diet.  When I saw the Mio energy product I was excited to try it.  That was until I first tasted it.  This stuff is awful.  I powered on after first taste and received no energy boost from this mix.  I will not use again.
0;This stuff tastes like the pink soap in a a gas station bathroom smells.<br /><br />Yuck.<br /><br />I threw the whole bottle away after two tastes.  I only took the second taste to see if it really tasted as bad as it did.
0;"""Although the cereal is a great tasting cereal I gave this one star because the price of $41.50 that they are selling it for here on Amazon is rediculous!!! That's almost $7 a box. I don't know about you but I know I've never paid $7 for a box of cereal. Wal-Mart sells the 21 oz. (6 pack) of Life Cinnamon cereal for $19.68. Just make sure you shop around because when you see a deal that you think may be to good to be true"
0;I bought this thinking that I could save money.  The taste is very poor and really doesn't taste good at all.  I used it about 5 times and will throw it out as soon as I go to the grocery store again to buy another brand.
0;"""Although this bread tasted decent. My husband had a severe allergic reaction. When he contacted Pamela's Products they told him many has had an allergic reaction to this mix. He advised them that they should post this information. Whether they will or not is up to them. This reaction caused his stomach to close and he had to go in and have it ballooned back open. If they would have posted  many people  having allergic reactions"
0;"""I can't even GIVE these things away.  The best description I can come up with is  Sawdust surrounded by wax.   Does not taste like white chocolate (or ANY type of chocolate) in the least.  I've yet to know anyone who can actually swallow a bite of one of these.  I have a  HELP YOURSELF  sticky note on the box at the office and everyone who has tried it"
0;"""Other reviewers here that gave this bar a good review must have been paid off by thinkthin.  Theses are the worst tasting protein bars I've ever tasted in my life.  At least other brands try to make their bar taste alright"
0;This coffee has a really strange taste. Not like pumkin pie at all. Originally I didn't believe the people who wrote the reviews so I bought it. But it was true! This coffee could be the worst ever. Plus it is expensive. I don't like it at all.
0;What a RIP-OFF. These chocolate bars can be found in the dollar aisle of many grocery stores.  They are also found in some 99-cent stores.  Don't be fooled into paying $8.94 (including shipping) for a $1.00 chocolate bar!

0;"""This has to be one of the most disgusting products I have tasted. If you are on the Atkins or low carb diet it is NOT truly low carb. The nutrition information was deceptive and when I tried to return the product (unopened) the return policy does not allow for returns. I threw away the entire order (since I could not return I opened one package and made pancakes...they were so bad I tried to feed them to my dog but she would not eat them either). Avoid this product at all costs! You can buy a much better product by ordering the REAL Atkins pancake and baking mix"
0;I had high hopes of this being delicious but was very disappointed in the flavor and texture.  It felt slimy on my tongue and the flavor was not even close to tasting like any ranch dressing I've ever had. I threw them away:(
0;Was looking to buy some dried strawberries when I came across this offering.<br /><br />In the description it says air dried strawberries without sulphur dioxide.<br /><br />In the picture shown the ingredients list sulphur dioxide!<br /><br />Not saying it's good or bad but why can't they describe what they are selling accurately???
0;I paid 2.99 a fifteen ounce jar or roughly 9 bucks for three.  Grossly overpriced here. Avoid this ripoff and look for cheaper. Also when measured out this fifteen ounce was barely more than an eight ounce cup. The fifteen ounces are not by liquid measure but by actual weight.&#128078
0;These tasted SO artifical & funky! And now I'm stuck with 9 lbs of them. I tried strawberry banana rings at a local frozen yogurt shop that were delish & found this great deal & ordered assuming they'd taste the same. Boy was I wrong. These are gross!!!!
0;Nutricity is the very worst ever place to order. I ordered almond butter thinking it came in a glass bottle and when I received it it was packages in plastic. I returned them and they send me an email saying they did not receive returns. When I tried to get in touch with them with their 800 number a recording said they only handle returns via email. I will never ever order from them. I highly recommend that nobody ever orders from them. When I ordered I never read that you couldn't return an item. And then to top it off I could not talk to anyone in their company they handle all via email. VERY DISSAPOINTING! DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THEM.

Definitely not ears of corn.<br /><br />And most of the meat is a byproduct"
0;When you taste these you only get the taste of salt. Either the package I got came from the batch Amazon had in storage for long period of time or when they packaged these someone overdozed the salt. I have these only because  the Roland Kalamata Pitted (whole) olives have been out of stock for couple month. As result had to dispose to trash Rolan Kalamata Halves.

0;This is the worst energy drink I ever tasted. It has a really big spicy flavor to the drink. The spicy to the drink over powers it and its impossible to even finish one out six.

0;I had been well experienced with different Brand Names to produce Mangosteen Juice. I do not believe this Dynamic Health Mangosteen Gold is made 100% Pure Organic Mangosteen Juice.

0;I have eaten Kopali Organic Mangos from grocery stores like Whole Foods before and they were excellent. The ones I received were horrible. I had different members of my family try them and they felt the same way. Then when I tried to return the remaining packages Amazon could not find my account and by the time it was straighten out it was too late to return them. I will not be purchasing food items from Amazon again.
0;The taste is definately not my thing.  For me it started out bland and as the chill wore off it went downhill from there.  I had to force myself to finish the container.  I did not think that the listed health benefits of the drink made it any better than other drinks of the electrolyte replenishing variety on the market today.  I do like the design of the container and although I was tempted to suggest a straw would be nice it is not absolutely necessary and would just add to the landfills.
0;This product completely dissapointed me. Im doing the lemonade diet and i was looking so foward to this maple syrup sweeting my lemonade but boy was i wrong. as soon as i tried it tasted horrible. you get such a nasty after taste. i would never buy this again

0;Someone I knew gave me a bag of this because they knew that I love mate unfortunately this is the worst mate I have ever had. The stuff is not even smoked which is weird because that has been part of the curing process ever since mate has been drank. The best way I could describe the taste of this mate is if you had a pile of really moist grass (like if you cut your lawn) and let it ferment in a dark warm room and then brewed it. Not good.

I gave both my dogs one Yam-Good each for about a month and the result was they almost died from vomiting and bloody stool. Despite their American sounding name"
0;I love the product and have bought at other places.  The reason I bought this from Amazon is they had a deal that allowed me to buy it for much less per bag than other places.  When I got it I noticed one of the 12 bags was opened already.  OK I was still in the black on the deal but after I put it on the shelf for a few days I pulled it down to get another bag and 3 more were open.  4 of the 12 bags were open and that isn't acceptable.

I may have to quit regular Kraft in protest of this insulting abomination. I know it may sound like I'm taking this too seriously"
0;"""I decided to give this product a try after reading all of the health benefits. I wanted to try something new and healthy.<br /><br />I cannot stand the taste of this drink. It tastes like very watered down tomato juice. It is just not for me. If you like tomato juice"
0;the package arrived as a disaster. One bottle of beverage completely leaked out and the original box and the package was watered and damaged. The UPS guy told me he knew something was wrong and suggested me to contact seller. I checked inside and some bottles showed greenish spots like some kind of mold.<br /><br />I haven't tried the beverage. No need.
0;"""My daughter and I loved the chebe pizza mix.  When you would open the package you would smell the oregano and it was heaven.  I just ordered more and obviously they changed the recipe.  I opened the package and was overwhelmed by the smell of vinegar.  Vinegar is not listed as an ingredient but that was what I smelled.  There was no sign of the oregano that was listed as an ingredient.  I cooked it so long that the cheese was burnt but the crust still was not browned.  It didn't rise at all and eating it was like chewing rubber.  Chebe wasn't the best rising product out there"
0;We got our box as a gift.  Even using the right amount of water it turned into a tapioca booger.  You'd never known until it was cut thought.  I'm just thankful we could scrape the toppings off and put them on a new crust.
0;"""I could not find an ingredient list anywhere for the Routin Sugarfree syrups.  So I ordered 6 bottles from another website (because I am a sucker for a  deal ) and received them today.  Not only does this caramel taste wretched"
0;"""Yuck....nastiest Pina Colada mix I have ever tasted in my life....and I have been a bartender for over 20 years. Left a terrible after taste in all of our mouths. I have traveled all over the tropics and have never tasted a Pina Colada as nasty as these. Go with  Bacardi frozen mixers  in your grocery store's freezer section. Now that is the best tasting Colada mix you will ever have....I guarantee it."""
0;"""Very disappointed with this product. I started using freeze dried chives bought from Super Target stores (Archer Farms brand). Thought I'd save some money and buy in bulk from Amazon. This Traders Choice product has neither chive aroma nor taste. Rather surprised no one else has complained. Suitable only for garnish"
0;Do NOT buy this product. I donated my entire box to the local food bank.<br /><br />Cream filling has some peculiar smell such that you will not feel like eating these cookies. Seriously stay away for this product
0;Don't buy this brand. Buy Huy Fong. It has a small portion of the sugar and sodium that Roland has. There's no way you're only going to eat one tsp of this. If you have 2 you're going to get more than an entire day's worth of sugar. Do yourself a favor and buy the real thing.
0;These are not particularly flavorful and the texture on your tongue is like chalk. There isn't any nutritional information for calorie and sugar content. So bad that I won't even try to give them away. I wouldn't want to ruin a child's Halloween!
0;"""My box of Skybars arrived from UPS in a pristine box. Inside it looked as if someone had stomped the box with a boot. Everything was scattered and in some cases torn up. I have reported this to Amazon"
0;Please don't purchase these noodles thinking you are going to smother them in Marinara or Alfredo sauce. They are meant for Asian stir fry and soup dishes.<br /><br />Also they smell terrible when you open the bag and you either have to run them under hot water or boil them first to get rid of the smell.<br /><br />Once they are washed they offer a neutral flaovr and can be added to any stir fry as a replacement for rice noodles.<br /><br />I would not purchase these again as I think the flavor is not good and you don't get enough for what you are paying for. The packs are ridiculously small.
0;Kids would not touch them and I didnt even dare trying them. I am preggo and I dont think that would have gone over well with the little one. The smell alone was vomit worthy! Dont even get me started on the texture. They looked very elasticy and just all around yuck!
0;I'm pretty tolerant of foods that don't taste good but this was literally the worst food product I have ever bought. probably. It tastes like rubber and it doesn't fill you up at all. I ate it with tomato pasta sauce and it was still gross. Also it gave me diarrhea which is really gross. NOT RECOMMENDED.
0;I was really hopeful after reading the positive reviews but I have to go with the people who say it's disgusting and not tolerable even for zero calories.  The fishy smell does go away but it's not easily forgotten once you've smelled it.
0;"""These noodles were just delivered and I was excited to make them for my weight and health conscious high school daughter and friend. I carefully read all of the reviews and took them into consideration when preparing these  noodles.  Yes"
0;OMG! definitely not what I expected!  The smell alone is enough to turn you off!  smells like really stinky fish!!!  I should of just bought one pack just to see what they are like!!  Instead I bought $60 worth!!! And I can't return them.  Stupid me should of read more closely!!  They taste like rubber. Even when I added them in a sauce - they were awful.  I just couldn't go thru with it.  Even my husband who eats sushi and other stuff I would never go near - said they were downright nasty!!  I started to gag!  But this is my opinion!  It's a miracle people eat these!
0;"""I had great hopes that this was the answer for my pasta cravings.  Wrong!!!  I bought a big box of 15 packs of noodles.  I did have great hopes with all the wonderful reviews I read.  I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed and rinsed some more"
0;"""This had such high reviews I was expecting much better. I can't describe the consistency except by saying jelly like and not the good kind of jelly. The smell is very fishy and if you wash them you can get rid of most of the smell. However"
0;"""NO RETURN!  NO REFUND!  The texture of all of the Miracle Noodle products is like eating plastic fishing worms.  I read the reviews and tried every way possible to improve the experience of eating this stuff.  5 minutes of rinsing"
0;"""I purchased these noodles thinking they would be a good replacement for pasta.  I had hoped that I could recommend them to my weight loss clients.  Unfortunately things just did not work out.  First of all"
0;This product is chewy like rubber bands.  I am on Atkins diet and was excited to learn about a low carb pasta.  Very disappointed in it chewiness.  Bought a six pack and threw five away.  And I am not a picky person
0;"""I read alot of reviews regarding these noodles and based on the description they seemed to be really good. They smell aweful as soon as you open them. The description said that they soak up flavors of the seasoning well"
0;There was no miracle about these noodles! They are in fact the worst thing I have ever attempted to eat in my life. They were so horrible I don't even care about returning them! For some laughs I gave them to friends to gag over just as I did!
0;"""I heard about this product on several tv show's and decided to try it myself.  What a mistake!! It may have no calories and be healthy for you because it's fiber but why didn't anyone warn buyer's about the SMELL!  I had to hold my nose to taste it!  Needless to say"
0;"""The shipping of the item was superb.  They came packed very securely.  But the noodles were just awful.  I guess I was expecting the noodle to be more  pasta  like.  I'm just glad I didn't spend more money on this product."""
0;I was thinking about the great number people that dislike these noodles and wondering what they would do with the extra packs they have order. I think I may have the solution Fish Bait!!! It smells bad which fish like and it is rubber-like which will stay on the hook well.  Just a thought
0;"""Nowhere in the description of this product does it state that this is an unappetizing looking mush in brine.<br /><br />Neither does it clearly state that this product is ineligible for return.<br /><br />I was confounded when I opened the box and found single-size portions of wet gloppy  noodles  in small bags.  I was fully expecting to get dry pasta.  I'm wondering if I can even get up the courage to try this stuff.<br /><br />Please"
0;"""This product is supposed to help you manage your weight loss by allowing you to eat  noodles  without the carbs and calories in real pasta. The idea is that it fills you up with zero calories because it is made only from plant fiber. I was excited about the idea and didn't mind paying over $2.00 a bag since it's cheaper on Amazon than on the company website. When the noodles got here I followed the cooking directions and seasoned them using my favorite sauce. Then I took the first big bite. This was a mistake! The noodles have a slimey"
0;Quick shipping.<br /><br />I really didn't like these noodles. The texture was awful & they had absolutely no taste at all. I threw the other 5 packs of them in the garbage. They actually turned my stomach. I had really hoped that they would be a great & healthy replacement for real noodles - boy was I wrong!
0;"""I am from a generation which does not throw away food. But these noodles went in the trash.  Some of the 1 star reviews were correct in stating the texture as being the primary problem. This is a great way to ruin a good meal by using these noodles as a base. Rubbery describes them well. It's like your mouth does not know what to do with them. I don't gag easily"
0;"""Purchased this for my daughter. the picture of the item certainly looked to us to include all five pez dispenser animals. She was only interested in one so I figured it was worth the price for all of them to get her the one. I guess I should have been on the lookout for  fine print.  Sad"
0;I'm changing this review from 5 stars to 1 star. This product used to be creamy and flavorful. The last two cases I've received have gone down the drain. The coconut milk is now dull and watery/oily. It's disgusting.
0;Happy to find a BPA free can filled with a good product.  Disappointed that more then 1/2 are always badly dented.  Have not rec'd a case without some type of dents in most of the cans even though the packaging was perfect and items secure.
0;I orderd the tea just for the tin. The regular tea came in just a box (I also ordered a refill) but he elephant tin never came even though it said it was in stock. They did refund my money but the tea isn't actually any better than say twiggins from your local store... just saying. not happy
0;"""I was so happy to see Sugar-free Hershey's Syrup on the grocery store shelf.  Anticipated all day having a scoop of sugar-free ice cream with a drizzle of sugar-free chocolate syrup.  Am I ever glad I tasted the syrup before ruining the ice cream with it.<br /><br />This syrup has the most vile"
0;Given how much I really enjoy the lite syrup I thought I would go one step further into sugar free land. That was a bad turn.  This lacks the rich chocolate flavor the regular and lite has.  It doesn't satisfy any chocolate craving so I am using what's left to beef up my chocolate protein powder drink mixes. It's not good for any other use.
0;Thought this would be awesome since I am now living a Low Carb lifestyle.  Was very disappointed.  It is very bitter and there is not a bit of sweetness to it.  It's like liquid unsweetened chocolate syrup.  Now I use it in my peppermint tea and add splenda to make it palatable.  These  reviews that rave about it boggle my mind.
0;"""Based on all the highly quality products turned out by Hershey this one totally missed the mark.  The powerful sour taste is so strong you can not even taste the chocolate.  The produce is a mistake or must be a bad batch. Our bottle was labeled  38D72  BB 10 2011 """
0;"""I did not realize that the items sold under the guise of  Managers Specials  are special because they are almost expired!  I bought the 6 pack and it was due to expire within a month...not ok.  I tried one bowl before donating the rest to a food pantry"

0;There is now a link between Autism and High Fructose Corn Syrup.  I am so disappointed in this product and that they would promote giving this to babies.  It may work for gas but the long term affects could be way worse.<br /><br /> See this link for more details.[...]<br /><br />I do not normally write reviews but feel everyone considering buying this product should know this.  Read the label.<br /><br />Erin
0;The seller claims that they give huge discount on the over 50$ item. However if you look closely they sell the smallest package (4 Lb) at a typical retail price(around 10$). The largest bag of the brand typically cost around 55$ not the small one!<br />Such prectice of traiding partners poorely reflects on Amazon's brand.
0;tastes great  but i found the same product at walmart for 1/2 the price.  really!!  UPDATE  I double checked on the price at walmart and for the same product same amount it costs $6.43 compared to $11 95 here.
0;I bought one of the Stash teas-don't remember which one. It contained gluten!  I am gluten intolerant but NEVER expected ANY tea to contain gluten.  There is NO reason for tea to contain gluten.  Celiacs beware!
0;"""This tea sounded great. I lived in the middle east and love the real moroccan mint tea. The real tea includes spearmint and green tea only. Honey is typically added. In this case all you can taste is lemon grass and the only hint of mint is peppermint"
0;"""I was looking for a tasty cracker that would go well with hummus or cheese or dip. These things taste like cardboard and turn to sticky glue after one bite. They have no flavor whatsoever. Not even salt or a good dip could save these molded wheat flour stamps. And if you think they're healthy"
0;"""bought this bar because of the ingredients and the nutritional analysis.<br />that is all that is good about this bar. it has an awful taste and it is super small for the price. i only wish i could return the 14 bars that i have left. what a rip off at $2 a bar"

0;"""Searching for the best sun-dried tomatoes is always a frustrating one because I am looking for a non sulfur dioxide product with nice flavor and affordability. These are affordable and mind you I read as much as I could including the labels and all the reviews but there was no mention of sulfur dioxide as an ingredient in this particular product. So I bought it with confidence thinking that although it was not organic"
0;I love most of the Kashi products I've tried. This was low in sugar which is great right BUT when my kids tried it and refused to finish it I tried it and I now know why. It tastes horrible....it has a very weird funny taste to it.
0;I actually bought these at Costco and was just curisous to see others opions. Was really suprised to find so many good review! For me the jelly center was a no go but to each there own. I should have looked closer at the package.
0;"""I should have known better than to order chocolate this time of year.  Most shippers refuse to ship chocolate to Florida in the summer.  As a Prime member I thought it might have been packaged well enough to get here in good shape.  There was nothing in the package to protect it from the heat and what should have been delightful little bites of chocolate covered pomegranate turned out to be a two pound block of chocolate with little bits of 'gummy' candy discs.  They may have been made with some pomegranate juice but not enough to give it that 'kick' that real pomegranate juice has.  Even if I see them on a shelf in a store and I can tell from feeling the package that they have not all melted together"
0;"""The idea of a popcorn bag that turns into a bowl is simply brilliant! I was sick of having to either get my hands covered with grease or clean the large bowl I'd dump my popcorn into. So I got these as soon as I saw them in the grocery store. Here are the problems"
0;Good idea but sadly the product does not deliver. The bag is hard to open without burning your fingers or making a mess and most times the popcorn in the middle of the bag is burnt. (I have followed instructions and tried a few different time settings) I also think it leaves a  bit more of a greasy filmy residue on my tongue than other  microwave popcorns.
0;"""We have been buying Chupa Chups for years and were quite surprised to see that this order contained  mini pops  - about half the size of the regular pops. This will be my last order from this vendor. Shame"
0;"""I bought a bunch of the Kitchens of India items during a promotional sale and the only one I'd recommend is the butter chicken sauce.  If they were tasty I could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but I'm not loving the taste.  I ofter buy similar products from Trader Joes and those"
0;"""I ordered this just because of a special deal going on at Amazon. It turns out they were being sold cheap for a reason. Just one packet contains 38% sodium which is too much. And the problem is that you can taste the nasty oil and too much salt due to so much sodium which I think is added as preservative. Would not recommend for regular eating. If you have ever eaten Indian meals"

0;"""I purchased the 6 pack of Good Earth Caffeine Free Sweet and Spicy. I was shocked when I compared the ingredients on the boxes I received to the ingredients listed on the Amazon website. Website states  100% Natural...No artificial Flavors . On the website"
0;"""I only gave this tea a star because I couldn't post a review without at least one. It really rates ZERO stars.<br />I had loved Good Earth Original Sweet and Spicy Caffeine Free Herbal tea from first sip"
0;"""I was so suprized to see on the front of the box  Artificial Flavor.  It also had Artificial flavor in the ingredients too. I couldn't believe such desceptive marketing. You think healthy good earth etc. I have been drinking this tea since the early 1980's. I had my first taste in the Good Earth Restaurant. Loved the ice tea version. I haven't had it for awhile and was excited to see it"
0;"""We have been drinking the Good Earth original tea for many years but this recent repackaging has changed the tea for the worse. We barely get one 8 oz. cup of tea with a bag and it is weak tea. Very disappointed with the new tea which is a far cry from the  original  and should not be labeled as it is."""
0;"""I am a big fan of Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Tea.  In July I ordered a pack of six 18-count boxes of caffeine free Sweet and Spicy tea bags.  I often give boxes as gifts.  The flavor of the tea from this order was not good.  Initially I thought maybe only one tea bag was bad"
0;"""I've been using this tea for over a year. I don't know what happened but this last  order of six boxes is just awful. Did Good Earth change the formula? Don't know but I will not be ordering this again. They have ruined a formally wonderful product!! So disappointed! However"
0;Ugh they changed the formula/ blend of their tea! It tastes dusty. Oh so sad - the box which is new to me says new look same taste but this is not true.<br />I bought 6 boxes and it's all getting tossed- so disappointed with this purchase and amazon for not taking it back
0;"""I purchased organic Good Earth (at a  whole foods  type of store) but not in the packaging shown.  I was disappointed in the flavor because it just seemed as though it used to be so much immediately spicy and flavorful and sweet.  Then I saw this package in another store and purchased it.  When I tried it I found it was more like what I had been expecting.  I compared ingredients between the two boxes.  Lo and behold the tea in the package shown had  artificial flavor  as ingredient #3!!  Wow!  So that was the ingredient that made it so appealing.  I had never read the label on the old Good Earth that I was so  addicted  to!! Needless to say"
0;Purchased two boxes of Sweet and Spicy decaf and it stinks!  It's not as sweet nor as spicy as it was before.  Really dissappointed and will stop buying it.  Just sorry I purchased two boxes as they'll both go to waste.
0;They've changed this recipe and it doesn't taste the same anymore.  The last time I order it was a little different but I could still drink it.  Now it's not the same at all and I'm so disappointed.  It's not even drinkable.  I'm going to contact the company to see if they can do anything.
0;"""I have been a drinker of the original Good Earth Tea for some time now and when I saw that Amazon had it I was thrilled.  I noticed that the box was different from what I had been using but it said it was the original blend so I went ahead and bought it.  I just had a drink of it and poured it out.  It was awful"
0;"""The purple box Good Earth Tea does NOT  have the same great taste  as the old beige box tea.  It tastes different and not in a good way.<br /><br />The purple box tea is NOT 100% natural.  It has  artificial flavor .<br /><br />Update: - Good Earth DOES make purple box tea with natural flavors.  The 25 count boxes are the ones to look for.  If you want natural flavors"
0;"""The product description for this tea on Amazon states:  All Good Earth teas contain absolutely no ... artificial flavors ....  What a joke. The third ingredient is  artificial flavor ! This product used to be naturally sweetened with Stevia leaf. It apparently has some kind of artificial sweetener now. What a disappointment. I will be cancelling my  Subscribe and Save  subscription for this product! Don't buy this product if you don't want to be drinking some unknown artificial ingredient."""
0;This has been my favorite tea for several years. The purple boxes list artificial flavoring instead of natural as the third ingredient. It now tastes like I remember kool aid tasting as a kid. Amazon customer service was great in refunding.
0;"""Good Earth Tea (Original Sweet and Spicy)~ whether caffeinated or decaffeinated has been my favorite tea for many years.  I am sick with disappointment over degraded and truly unrecognizable taste of this formerly perfect cup of tea. I will be telling all the friends I have introduced to the  good old recipe  over the years that our Good Earth Tea is no longer the same and that they should not waste their money on the new<br />recipe. I'll be taking the last four boxes I bought back to the grocery store for a refund. I called the TATA company this morning to find out the scoop on the change of the taste of the tea and to register my disappointment.  If anyone from the new Good Earth Company reads Amazon reviews"
0;"""I've had marrons glaces plenty of times before out of the country and these were a mediocre imitation at best. I figured it was too good to be true to get so much for the price - the good ones are very pricey. Instead of the delicious syrup they're supposed to have"
0;You might want to see a video on how to open this bottle before you order it.  There is an instruction on how to open this bottle but their hard to see due to small words.  Taste like Seven Up.  Quantity is very small.
0;Just received this product in a box with 4 cds that I ordered. No packing material in the box. What I got was a box of cookie crumbs! Not one cookie was whole or intact. I will not order this again!!! Will not eat these crumbs either. Very disappointed.
0;all cured meats are over priced with shipping and handling why can we not get a fair price of meat with shipping and handling. i would like to try different products of cured meats.amazon did show me where i can get my cured meats at a fair price and fair shipping but they are limted but not enough for me to change yet.this is for all cured meats not just this one i have not tried this one but would like to but price to high. the company you showed me i have have been ordering every month for over a year.it is a fair shipping price no matter how much i order. t j appico thank you for that info.
0;I ordered two different flavors of ZippFizz.  The company accepted payment for both but only included one in the box.  I sent an email and called inquiring the status of the other flavor and never heard a word from them.  My suggestion would be to find another resource to purchase products - pass this one bye.
0;"""Lindt's original recipe was the gold standard of dark chocolate. Mother Temptation's favorite child. But what is success in today's world if it can be exchanged for failure? And failure itself is the success of this new recipe. Lindt soyed the taste to where the experience of flavor is completely overtaken with the question of:  What have I just eaten?  Remember the world in the movie Soylent Green? This is the chocolate for them."""
0;"""The new formula 70% Lindt chocolate bar is terrible. Nothing at all like the old formula which was one of my favorites. I wrote to Lindt about this and they responded that marketing research found more people preferred the taste of the new formula bar.<br /><br />I wonder if they used the same company that recommended  new coke "
0;"""What a surprise when I only received 3 bars total!  The seller blamed it on Amazon putting in the wrong information.  The ad was marked as sold out for a few days.  Yesterday I was checking and the same ad was back on.  When I contacted the seller they again blamed Amazon.  They were again offering a pack of 12 for $[...].  Today they have changed it to a pack of 12 for $[...].  I will be keeping a close eye on them and hope you do too!  An honest seller would have checked their listing and honored their ad. They are saying that Amazon confused thier listing with other sellers of this same product.  They are the only ones selling Lindt Excellence Dark Chocolate 70-Percent Cocoa Bars"
0;First time buying this and won't buy it again. I've tried the low fat Silverado chili and it is just as mild as this one. Difference is it's not loaded with unnecessary lard and I can add my own heat. This one is not the least bit hot. If a company is going to market something as 'Ignited by Habanero' it better have Habanero in it. I've had Campbell's Firehouse Chili and that one is a little bit spicier and has less calories. Still prefer the low fat Silverado though.<br /><br />I'll be giving away the rest of this 6 pack.
0;I ordered the cereal at the first of May- as my husband and I love it and use it daily... we have a subscription to keep us stocked up.  Our last order was damaged so badly- it was not even delivered to us... that has been weeks ago and we have not gotten word of replacement yet... I am not happy.  Please resend the order and let me know what the arrival date is.  Jan Wattles
0;"""After reading the ingredients list on this product  I know I will never buy or drink any. I would be telling anyone I can how unhealthy this drink is. Whey protein is a debatable protein source. I prefer a protein powder such as hemp. It is easily digested and mixes well with liquids. The only way soy is healthful is if it is fermented"
0;"""Texmati is a brand name that mimics the word Basmati and this rice should not be mistaken to Basmati Rice that grows in the foothills of the Himalayas. Basmati rice is known for its long chain carbohydrates structure (conversion of starch into sugar is slower) vs short chain carbohydrates in any other type of rice"
0;"""We are sooo disappointed in this product...every can contains potatoes that vary in color from white to black.  It is very hard to enjoy a bowl of New England Clam Chowder when you have to sift through old and bad tasting potatoes.  We thought it would only occur in one or two cans...however"
0;I called Kellogg's to see why Special K red berries has the natural preservative but Special K blueberry has the killer BHT.  The women who answered wasn't helpful and didn't know why. She also seemed annoyed with my question.  I won't even give my dog food with BHT why would I feed my family a cereal with BHT.  Why don't these company use the more natural and safer preservative like tocoperol etc?
0;If you don't have a lot of hand strength it's not the right container to get.  The lid is pretty much impossible to get off if the plastic is cold.  It gets very frustrating to have to wait for someone else to get the lid off for you.  The bags themselves are great though.  I think the bone shaped one might be easier to use and will probably give that one a shot.
0;When I recieved  my case of Keebler Waffle Cones the box  was crunched up in a few areas.  Mostly at the corners.  I opened the box and some of the cone boxes were also crushed a little.  You could shake the boxes and tell they were broken.  I opened each box and out of the 6 boxes 90& of the cones were broken.  I called Amazon and they were sincerely apologetic and sent me another case.  Unfortunately the same thing happened.  I didn't bother calling this time.  I was afraid they would think I was scamming them.  I think between the 2 cases(12 boxes) I got 5 boxes of cones if you took all the damaged ones out.  When I say damaged I don't mean cones with just a little bit broken.  I  mean totally unable to use at all.
0;"""Nielsen-Massey's Orange Blossom Water is dreadful -- primarily because it isn't orange blossom water at all. It's a mixture of chemicals with orange oil added. I bought it and will not use it in my cooking -- I'm afraid it'll ruin what I'm making. If you've used Monteaux in the past"
0;"""I didn't purchase this product because of the reviews.  So I went searching and found it at:  olivenation.com.  You do have to enter  Orange Water  in the search box to find it.  I'll order from them and hope theirs is better than this one."""
0;It smells like diesel fuel and has absolutely no orange blossom/flower fragrance.<br />It lists orange oil and other natural flavors in the ingredients. There should be no<br />orange oil in true orange blossom water. I'm surprised that a brand like Nielsen-Massey<br />would sell an inferior product like this. I couldn't even use this in cosmetic preparations.
0;Does not have the same flavor as when you cook things with Dr. Pepper. It actually is just cheap BBQ Sauce with Dr. Pepper on the label.  By some good sauce and mix in your own DP it is much better that way (don't forget to reduce the dp)
0;"""I bought these expecting them to be like others I've had in the past. But what a sickening surprise! The chocolate coating is fine but the orange center is so tangy as to be almost lacking in sweetness entirely. My tongue could not take it! I contacted Jelly Belly only to be told I would have to send back the entire bag for a substitute product"
0;I bought this product because it looked like a good substitute for vegetable broth but unfortunately they chose to use a soy sauce with gluten in it so I cannot eat the product and I cannot return it even though it was never opened. The seller should list the ingredient list for their product so that customers with allergies can determine if the product is safe. The other common allergen in the product is soy.
0;I purchased Tully's Decaffeniated House Blend 24-count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers.  They open up around the top seal when brewing and the coffee grounds get into the coffee and also make a mess inside the machine.  Unless you want to strain your coffee and clean your entire machine after each use do not purchase this product.
0;"""Many of these exploded making a huge mess with grounds spewing in and out of the cup and onto the counter.<br />After the first one I thought maybe there was one bad one.  I have seen it before with Green Mountain brand but rarely"
0;I bought this item because it was significantly discounted.  Since I received it I have had several of the K-cups break when punctured during dispensing.  This is a very big pain to have to clean up.  I am wondering how I can get my money back because I am not willing to use the 20 cups I have left.
0;I have yet to have one cup of this coffee brew properly.  Always leaves grounds in the cup an about have of the time the thing blocks the coffer maker and blows grounds all over the coffee maker and counter.  This is the only brand I have had this problem with and threw away about 40 K cups rather than clean the mess.
0;I do not recommend this food for your pet. I ordered this as a replacement food for my two adult boxers. About a week after transitioning to this food my two year old female started having head tremors. I did some research and found that this is benign and can happen with foods with certain ingredients. I changed the food and the head tremors stopped. I now feed my dogs Taste of the Wild and love it.
0;"""I am a big fan of Summer Susages and this has to be the worst one I have ever had.  The consistanty is that of a paste that has been form pressed into the shape of a susage.  I had to put it in the freezer to give it any firmness at all.  That alone makes it entirly unappealing as I feel like I am squishing a pureed form of fat in my mouth.  The flavor is not too bad"
0;I've been buying KAL stevia for awhile now with good results but now I decided to go cheap and buy 1 lb of this stuff thinking it would be pretty much the same. Nope... It's way weaker than KAL and takes 3-4x as much so even though I saved 50 percent I'll be wasting more money using more of the product. Oh well. I'll use it up and buy KAL again.
0;"""I purchased one pound of Now brand stevia extract for $63.61. The overly large container is labeled  Better Stevia   Certified Organic . Ingredient:Organic Stevia Extract Powder. I found I needed to use at least five times more stevia powder to get a similar sweetness as the Kal brand. I returned it for a refund.<br />Avoid this.

0;"""This stuff is as tough as leather. I love jerky and of course I've tried jerky that is tough before but this stuff I literally could barely get my teeth through it. I thought I was going to have to microwave it in some water to soften it.<br /><br />I checked and made sure it was in date and that the packaging wasn't broken anywhere to let air in. Bag was in perfect condition and was well within expiration date.<br /><br />The taste was just average. I would never buy this again. It wasn't just this flavor. I also had a bag of the same brand but a different flavor and it was exactly the same.<br /><br />Worst jerky I have ever had"
0;"""I innocently started giving these to my cats - had no idea they would begin to control my life.  Run out of treats?  you're screwed.  One cat cries so loud in the morning it sounds like someone is torturing her.  Eventually"
0;I received my order a couple of weeks ago.  The shipment has live bugs -- Sawtooth Grain Beetles.  I have had to move the bag from my pantry to the garage.  I have sealed it and placed it in a closed can but still not sure how to kill them without contaminating the seeds.  Usually I place a bay leaf on the top of any grain to keep bugs out.  This bag was received with live bugs already in the shipment. The seeds sprout okay after rinsing them so they deserve at least one star.
0;"""I bought these seeds through wheatgrasskit web site - it is not a secure web site. I was stupid  bought anyways though that site and had false credit card purchases made within 2 days of purchase.<br /><br />Also I grow my wheatgrass by hydroponic"
0;nice organic seed. Will need to order a larger quantity next time to try to get the costs down a bit I'm still somewhat new to wheatgrass so learning lots and lots.  Craig<br /><br />Update: I have since noticed lots of bugs in the seed. Since this is my first experience I am not sure if this is normal or not? Does anyone have any experience with this? Would love some feedback?<br /><br />I have pictures if anyone wants to see them...
0;"""I am extremely dissatisfied with the product and customer service from this company (Barry Farm). It says on the page for this product  Usually ships within 6 to 10 days . I ordered this product over three and a half weeks ago and just received it. I was still charged over $8.00 for shipping (more than the item was worth). I took precautions for the product not to sit in the sun and melt"
0;"""I wish I could give this food ZERO stars! It doesn't even deserve 1 star. I switched from wellness core to this food because I read an OLD review and critique of this food BEFORE P&G bought them. No grain"
0;Although this popcorn was advertised with the Presto Poplite hot air corn popper it is too small and too light to work with this machine. It is even stated in the instructions that came with machine as not recommended type to use. Made good duck feed though.
0;I blame Amazon.com not Ammish country for recommendig this otherwise good popcorn when I bought a hot air popper.  the instructions with the popper said don't use small kernel light popcorn.  they were right.  it all just flew out of the popper before it had a chance to pop
0;In my previous review I gave this 5 stars.  Then I read other reviews and came to realize that this chicken is from China.  What?  We have no organic chickens in the USA?  I am very disappointed in this product.  I encourage anyone considering buying this to Google the product.
0;"""I have been using Breathies for my dog for years and this is the first time I was disappointed with the product. When I opened the bag I thought they seemed harder than usual. The packaging states  best before 03/23/2012  and these were ordered on April 29th. I believe this is the first time I ordered from this particular vendor (Happy Dog Place"
0;Bought this product on the recommendation of Vivian Goldschmidt ( Osteoporosis Guru) as she claims Flouride is harmful to bones and green tea has naturally occurring flouride in it- this product is supposed to be flouride free.  It tastes awful!
0;I got the item very quickly. In about 2 days. I was exited to recieve it so quickly. As soon as I opened it my exitement immediatly disappeared. The plant was dying and leaves were falling off. Very Disappointed
0;Plant was received in poor condition.  Lost many leaves and am still working on keeping it alive and restoring to look as photo.  In future I will not purchase live plants from outside of area.  Recommend buying at local stores instead of shipping!
0;Horrid! Tastes like someone mixed hot water and artificial sweetener together and  added a couple of drops of cheap chocolate syrup.  What a waste of money. Agree completely with the reviewer who said a packet of swiss miss was the far better option.
0;"""I was super excited to get hot chocolate for my keurig.. and clearly I bought the wrong brand.  This is the nastiest hot chocolate I have ever had in my entire life.  It tastes like some kind of weird"
0;I ordered this after I tried the Green Mountain Hot Chocolate just to try something different and compare. The other reviewers are totally correct. There is a really strange after taste. I threw out the whole box. I had a cup of the Green Mountain today and was so relieved to know I can have yummy hot chocolate again. Pass on this brand.
0;"""I bought Innova wet when I had 1 kitten in the house and he shunned it. I bought a second can when kitten #2 arrived and she backed away from it! I had one extra can in which I added some water to soup it up"
0;My cats did not like this at all and would not eat it. Some healthy cat foods have been refused by my cats and they are expensive. There should be more samples. I guess it would be like having a choice between broccoli and chocolate for most people!
0;"""I tried it a few times. First to just try.  Then again to compare against Nespresso Capriccio (green pod) which has an intensity of 5 and is made like the ECC's Expressivo. Arabica and Robusto mix.  The Nespresso Capriccio is not my favorite because it is relatively weak.  Then I tasted the Expressivo"
0;Made of Vegeplast's bioplastic. Requires a significantly harder push on the Nespresso lever to punture the thick capsule. Coffee tastes mediocre and is nowhere near the quality of real Nespresso aluminum capsules. These Ethical Coffee capsules are only 10 cents less than the .60 cents each real Nespresso capsules ordered directly from Nespresso with $6.95 two day shipping. Amazon does not allow returns of these/food item.
0;"""This review is based on using these pods with a Nespresso Espresso machine.  Don't waste your money.  This coffee is not espresso.  It is a high priced 40ml cup of thin and weak drip coffee at best.  It does not have the body"
0;"""I purchased these pods for my nespresso machine to save a little money but I actually lost money. I tried using the pod. At first only water came out and then only a little bit of espresso came out. The lever was hard to close when i did put the pod in there. When I lifted the lever to release the pod"
0;"""Simply terrible.  Awful.  I've never tasted a worse espresso in my life.<br /><br />ECC Espressivo vs. Nespresso Roma vs. Nespresso Ristretto ... I expected to write a detailed taste review after pulling each of these shots this morning"
0;"""My baby girl choked on this!!  She had been eating food for sometime and even had food  from the table .  I packed this because we were going to a local festival and was worried there wouldn't be much there she would be able to eat.  She appeared to be chewing the spaghetti and seemed just fine.  All of a sudden she began choking and I had to clear her throat.  The spaghetti had  gummed up  and formed a ball in the back of her throat.  The experience was absolutely horrible.  Please keep a close eye on your little one if you choose to feed this and be sure to feed extra slow!"""

0;"""I have to wonder what the other reviewers are talking about. The tea I received was packaged as described but consisted of tea dustings -- the dust left over after everything else is gone. I use FINE mesh teaballs and this tea dust just goes right through. The bottom of the cup is covered with it and you get to drink the dust as well.<br /><br />Even then"
0;"""This is the worst green tea I have ever had. Don't be fooled by the pristine picture on the packaging. This tea is made in China--I doubt where this tea is grown looks anything like the picture. I try not to buy food products from China considering how polluted it is. This may be  organic  but the water and air in China is toxic so it doesnt really matter. The taste is all off and it leaves a sour/bitter taste in your mouth. The tea bags are made of a cheap brown material. Overall this product is bad."""
0;The packaging for the Organic Steel Oats was awful.  When I opened the box every single container was opened and there were oats everywhere.  One more thing: the oats were packaged with 12 can of soup.  Poor combination.  No wonder why they burst open.  Amazon must do a better job of protecting the contents for shipment.  They may have already been punctured.  I will return the item.<br /><br />Update: I contacted Amazon about the packaging. Amazon responded to my e-mail within 3 hours. I requested the oats be replaced. Amazon apologized about the packaging and are sending a new shipment. Thank you Amazon for your customer service.
0;"""You might want to check youtube to see how foie gras is obtained before you buy it.  It is obtained through torture. The ducks and geese are violently force fed an incredible amount of food until their liver becomes diseased"
0;This cereal is one of my favorites. However this seller is ripping people off. The same size boxes are in the store for about $3.50. Why would you ever pay $40 for 4 boxes? There are other sellers on amazon who sell 7 boxes for this price.
0;Checking prices out on the website-this is ridiculous. I can buy a gallon of this at Wal-Mart for $2.50-$3.00. I don't know where they're coming up with $39.99 for 4. I called Amazon and they were not any help. Just beware.
0;"""I was feeding our cat 2 cans a day of Fancy Feast for six months. No snacks or treats or other food. She's very active and gained 1 and 1/2 pounds in that time. After speaking with our vet who was concerned about the weight gain she referred to Fancy Feast as the McDonalds of cat food. Junk food essentially. High in calories and fat. Sure your cat loves it.. but would you feed you kids McDonalds every day just because they like it? Find something better. Wellness"
0;I bought the fancy feast from you because I like the idea I didn't have to pay shipping.  That was a lie though you guys charged me shipping.  Plus the price is the same in the local grocery store.  The toy Hagen Catit Design Senses Play Circuit was ok but centainly not as great as the company stated it was. I'm very disapointed with this purchase of both items and I don't believe I'll be buying anymore for Amazon.
0;"""I started ordering these cases a few months ago and had to cancel after my cats threw up on two different occasions after eating this food... One of my cats NEVER EVER throws up and threw up from this-- and the only two cats who threw up were the ones who ate this! So I'm 99% sure it was from the food. Since it happened again a couple of weeks later"
0;"""These are made in China (do not buy ANY pet food from China).  Dogswell has been using propylene glycol to soften their treats (what are they thinkng?).  Do not purchase or support this company in any way until they clean up their act.  And for whatever reason Amazon doesn't allow returns of this item"
0;Updating my prior review from  2009 as my dog was very sick with a mystery illness last year with enlarged liver and kidney issues.  I was heartsick as he was so ill.  I spent several thousand dollars on vet care and testing.  It never dawned on me it could have been these chews -- I just realized that they were made in China and the brand is listed as one of those implicated according to this month's Whole Dog Journal.  Amazon should stop selling These until the manufacturer stops using their China plant.
0;"""I bought these for my Dalmatian for the first time about a month ago. He LOVED them...so much that even though I only gave him the recommended amount per day for his weight class he STOPPED EATING HIS FOOD.<br /><br />I went in to Petco and spoke with a customer service rep who told me a couple of people had come in with similar experiences. He said he was personally curious about it and did some research online and pulled up some reviews (which we looked up together while I was in the store) of people with the same issue. We discovered Dogswell now makes this product in China. Whether or not that automatically makes it unsafe I don't know but given the other reviews and the sign from my own dog I am no longer willing to risk it. Do some research - google  Dogswell made in china  and decide for yourself."""
0;Beware.. there are warnings to NOT feed your dogs chicken treats made in China.  They are causing kidney failure and DEATH.  I use to give my pets these and they loved them.. but I'm not going to risk my babies health with a product made in China. [...]
0;The initial shipment of treats were spoiled - the sweet potato was moldy inside the bag. Requested replacement and they were the same. Obviously these have been stored somewhere unsuitable and they were ruined. Have given up trying to convey this to Amazon as they obviously don't get it...
0;I am very disappointed in this product. This product was marketed for large dogs and believe me this was not for a large dog. They are very small in diameter and length. Will not order this product ever again.

0;"""I wish that the food companies would treat their customers with respect by not putting unhealthy ingredients in their products.  These bouillon cubes contain not only an inordinate amount of sodium but MSG as well.  And then as an added bonus they threw in some hydrogenated oil.  WHAT are they thinking when they pump this garbage out and box it up?  Hey Knorr - if we all end up too sick to work from eating this kind of so-called food"
0;"""My office of 4 women tried this coffee. Every single one of us thought it was disgusting. Some of us checked to see if the beans had mold on them because it tasted SO bad.  And the SMELL! We didn't notice it when we were making the coffee but if you take a little sniff from the bag"
0;"""I have been using Starbucks coffee for quite awhile and I do like it. When I saw the $1.50 coupon for their fusion flavored coffee I thought I'd give it a try and purchased the caramel flavored. The first pot I brewed full strength. It did not have a caramel flavor nor did it smell of caramel"
0;"""Wasn't very good. I have been eating Classico sauce on my spaghetti for years and thought that I would try something different... this sauce was very runny and had a dull flavor. I figured it would be better than Classico (which is half the cost of this)"
0;"""I bought this sauce expecting really good sauce. It was terrible. I tried to doctor it myself and no matter what I did it had this yucky aftertaste like old garlic. I can't believe this great chef put his name on the sauce. It is runny"
0;The one lb. tin is well packed and melded together.<br />I had to bang it with a meat cleaver carefully to separate the clomps.<br />It all tastes strange because bits and bits of all the candies<br />are all over each candy.  So an orange candy first tastes of peppermint and/or<br />other flavors before it is the taste of orange.<br />Moral:  This is what happens when you dwell on Christmas Past.  HA!  Cheers!
0;This product was totally not worth the money...the sweets are not fabulous in taste. I bought the 1lb which is the blue container and the amount does not look like 1lb. The display picture is not true to the content. I would definitely NOT buy again.
0;"""My four cats liked the smell of these treats but they would not eat them.<br /><br />The treat to human eyes is totally unappealing. Not only are they freeze-dried raw but they look hairy (similar to a dust bunny I would find under the bed). In size"
0;I was looking for black shoe string licorice for decoration on a baking project I was doing. I was disappointed to receive rope licorice instead and that I could not return it for a full refund even though it had not been opened or used. Now I am stuck with 6 pkgs of black rope licorice that I will never use and am out $24.00.  Luckily I was able to find a local source for the shoe string licorice in small quantities and a cheap price.  Never buying food from Amazon again :&lt
0;I was excited to order this product since it is gluten free--however I opened the lid and the seal was broken--as if someone had tried it and returned it!<br />YUCK!<br />I threw it away instantly.<br />What a dissappointment since I had already started to cook.<br />What I learned from this:  always check things as soon as you get them--don't wait--because then you can't return it!

0;I live in the country and have several Bluebird and Tree Swallow Houses mounted on 6 foot poles scattered about.  Racoon(s) began raiding the nests.  I bought the pellets and the spray.  Scattered a whole box of pellets around the ground where I still had active bird nests a couple of weeks ago.  I used the spray just yesterday on the ground around these nests and sprayed the steel posts the Nest Boxes are attached to.  This morning I checked the closest Tree Swallow nest to my house and sure enough a Racoon had a late night dinner of the two baby Tree Swallows inhabiting the nest and the nest was all torn up.  The spray could not have been any fresher as it had been applied only a few hours before this attack.  I have to say that this product simply does not work.  At least with racoons.
0;Decided to really give this product a try.  We have a chipmunk and skunk problem in our yard.  Put the critter ridder in the skunk and chipmunk holes and...nothing.  The chipmunk happily stayed and had no problem with the critter ridder whatsoever.  The skunk also didn't seem to even notice.  We used 3 bottles of the stuff and it didn't work at all.  What a waste of money.

0;I ordered this from Amazon like 6 months ago and I still have 3 packs remaining. I am an Indian and love chicken curry but I'm sorry to say that this prodduct was a complete disappointment. I have had other products from KoI. The paste is not spicy at all- rather bland. It seems to be missing some of the spices needed to make it taste Indian.<br />Not recommended especially if you've had authentic Indian curry in India.
0;"""I ordered several 6 pks. thinking this was going to be great teasting and it was terrible...very strong tasting. My husband is Indian and we both love curry. I made the Chicken Curry with the paste accoring to directions and it tasted stale & flat for lack of a bettr description. Of course we have eaten some of the best chicken curry around so maybe that is why we did not like it. Also the rice mix was the absolute worst"
0;"""Blue Diamond almonds have always been my favorite.  I had gone awhile without them so decided to splurge on a 12-pack.  I've snacking on them for the last couple of weeks but was really disappointed with the flavor"
0;The seller was amazing and fast so I would order from them again. But I am sad to say the tea was just not at all what I expected and I drink a lot of tea from many higher end tea houses. It had no flavor of carrots or cake in fact it was dual tasting. I just tossed it after the first cup. I was disappointed because the price was excellent and I wanted an amazing fall tea without paying $30 for just 2 oz from Teavana.
0;I'm not sure why these are labeled as super mini bulbs.  These bulbs are larger than standard incandescent bulbs and will not fit in many of my fixtures.  I suspect amazon has mixed up the bulbs they are selling.  I checked the manufactures website and this model bulb is not the item number that matches the super mini bulbs.  EP2357AE bulbs are listed as 23-Watt Full Spectrum Bulbs.  E2352AK is the product number for 23 Watt Super Mini Bulbs and they are not full spectrum bulbs.  As of the date this review was typed the manufactures website is not showing a Super Mini 23 Watt Full Spectrum Bulb.  I'm returning these.  I also purchased the 15 Watt Super Minis and they are not the correct item either.<br />If you decide to purchase these bulbs you may want to check the manufactures website after you receive the bulbs to make sure you did in fact receive the right item.

I tried the Capelin because it was from the same Icelandic environment like Romanoff and similar brands and couldn't beat the pricing with what looks like a great  fancy  packaging and opted out of my Salmon choice to try a new type of fish.  Ultimately a Very Bad Idea especially if someone would have been older with a weaker immune system. Stick with the familiar fish over this one.<br /><br />Caveat Emptor on this Caviar!!!"""

So then I let it sit and calm down and then I gave it another 30 seconds (trying for the 1 min and 40 sec instructions) and it boiled over again. At this point I just let it sit in the microwave for 6 minutes and then tried eating it. It was not soup though"
0;I'm a huge peanut butter fan and tried pretty much every peanut butter by every brand and I honestly think this is the worse peanut butter I had ever tried. It tastes terrible and is kind of rubbery. This is my least favorite brand of peanut butter.
0;The product arrived in fine shape. The actual product packaging was attractive. The product it self was very weak and poor tasting. I was excited to try another vendor of this style. I won't try this product from this vendor again or any other item in their product line. Huge dissapointment
0;These ribs splinter terribly into small sharp pieces.  Took them away from my dog as I don't want to risk an intestinal perforation from these.  Very disappointed in these.  I'll stick to bully sticks from Bravo instead.

0;"""This stuff tasted so terrible that I had to spit it out before any more of the content permeated my poor mouth. Most people around me wouldn't take up the dare to try one because of the hamster-cage smell drifting out of the bag. The couple people who tried couldn't keep it down. Listen"
0;"""I used to love these when they were still available in the U.S.  I ordered them from this seller and they tasted like axle grease.  I'm not even kidding.  I was skeptical from the moment I opened the package considering they had used musty old newspaper for padding.  They refused to refund my money on the grounds that they hadn't heard complaints from any other customers"
0;"""Didn't realize these would actually be coming from GERMANY and that the quantity would be about half a package as the package size I used to buy in the USA. Tasted stale - perhaps because of the things they used in Germany to make the product as opposed to the great things here in the USA. I would NOT suggest you buy this if you are here in the USA. Perhaps its different in Europe"
0;I was not satisfied with this purchase.  The advertisement was for a bulk container and the licorice came in 5 plastic bags.  2 of the bags were torn open as a result of the shipping process.  The licorice itself is an excellent product but the item identified was not as ordered.<br /><br />I will not purchase this item here again.
0;I make all my daughters food and thankfully she prefers what I make over jar food.  I do have those times when I need something quick to grab on the go.  Ella's Organics is a great go to. Paying this much for one pouch is a huge huge rip off.  Usually Babies R Us has them for $1 - $1.40 most likely on sale for a dollar though.  I am really happy with the Happy Baby brand too ... also almost $2 a pouch but usually on sale. Just last night my local grocery store had a 10/$10 sale on this brand.<br /><br />Seek out this product just never for this price!! Yikes.
0;"""Be sure you understand they are asking you to give them about $40 for only **7** squeezies. That makes them nearly $6 each!!!! For fruit sauce??? There are SEVERAL other brands which offer the same thing--pureed fruits and vegetables in soft squeezy packages that can be sucked out by toddlers in carseats--and they are selling for around $35 for ***24***packages of squeezies. See that difference? The stuff tastes just as good"
0;"""This stuff is garbage and Ella's Kitchen should be ashamed for false advertising. I was really surprised to see a fruit product like this one had so much calcium (10%) on the package compared to most of the other baby fruits out there (usually 0-2% unless veggies or yogurt's added in) and chose this over other products"
0;I almost stopped giving my son iron drops thinking that this product was giving him much of his daily iron needs. The sweet potato/pumpkin flavor says it contains 45% of the daily iron needs but really it only has 2%. I don't understand how this company can just lie on the nutrition label.

0;I just received these today for my wife.  They were the most horrible tasting coffee ever.  This wasn't just a case of not caring for this -- the coffee was down right nasty.  Both my wife and I thought so.  I don't know if we just got a bad batch or what -- but we wont be ordering this again.

0;The amount of butter used in these popovers caused runover while baking that had my smoke detector going off!  I had to clean my oven (self-cleaning) and remove the battery from my smoke detector.  Our house was full of smoke and we had to open doors and windows and use the ceiling fan to disperse the smoke!
0;"""I certainly could do better by these if I just went over to Grama's house and raided her flowerbeds. I am not sure what I truly expected but it was not a bag a teeny microscopic half brown buds. The package is not sealed and one side is just dust where the buds crumbled. I showed the pic of the good side to point out the brown ones. The smell upon opening was overwhelming with the first whiff. Then it evaporated immediately and left a strong rank tea like chemically enhanced odor. I assure you I will not be using these for human consumption due to that lingering odor. Since they bare not commercially packaged etc"
0;"""I am downgrading from a 5 star to a 1 star because they are made in CHINA. Treats from China have been associated with kidney and liver failure and rare cancers in dogs. Another series of dog deaths from treats from China has been released. There is no oversight. These treats may be OK but I will not take any chances. I am really irritated with Amazon and the vendor for not disclosing the source of the product. They say in the online description"
0;I bought these at a local store. I broke up the first one for smaller training treats. My finger was stabbed by a needle shaped fish bone. This bone could have easily perforated my dogs digestive tract and made him very ill or dead. I have contacted the manufacturer and have yet to receive a response.
0;My coworker brought these into the office today and placed some in a bowl on my desk. I didn't see the container so I couldn't check the ingredients but knew as soon as I ate one that they had splenda on them. I have nothing against splenda in reasonable amounts (I use it in my lattes) but these taste like splenda covered almonds. These will go into the garbage.

0;I have very healthy 45 year old teeth and one bowl of this cereal was enough to break a large chuck off one of my teeth.  Be careful as I never expected to find gravel hard chunks in my bowl of breakfast cereal.  I am just sickened by it since I do take such pride in my teeth and to make matters worst its a front tooth!  If you don't like to chew gravel for breakfast then you likely won't enjoy this cereal.  Yeah it taste pretty good and may be healthy for you but not worth breaking your teeth over.  We won't even talk about denist bills.  Notice I am not the only review about broken teeth from this cereal.  The chunk broke off my tooth is at least the size of a average size pea so not just a tiny little salt grain.  If you like your teeth stay away from this cereal!  Ezekiel Almond Cereal
0;I received my order in a timely manner but when I tasted the lemon packets they didn't taste right.  Couldn't find a expiration date so I didn't feel comfortable using them.  I threw them away. Didn't mind wasting the cost of the lemon packets but the shipping had doubled the price. Lesson learned.
0;highly disappointed !!!!! i have been using Tetley cardamom for years and was very pleased with it. I thought of trying ginger flavor but felt like cheated.....using even two teabags at once does not give even an essence of ginger...wish Tetley had a better quality assurance department to check things before they send them out for sale...
0;When I received this is tasted terrible! I have been buying this brand locally for some time and I know how it should taste. This must be really old. I noticed there was no expiration dates on the product but when I buy it locally it always has an expiration date. I wouldn't recommend buying this! Beware
0;"""I am interested in buying this for personal use.  There is no description at all about what I am buying other than it's Vintage brand seltzer.  What is 28 pounds?  Is it 1 pound of product and 27 pounds of container?  27.9 pounds of seltzer and .1 pounds of container?  How much is a pound of seltzer anyway? Are all 28 pounds in one container"
0;they taste good but weather its the peanuts or sunflower inside<br /> is rancid and taste old which upset my stomack and throw the<br />rest of the order out.a lot of times this is not because the<br />product sits on the shelves too long but the company uses cheap<br /> ingredients to begin with. just went bought some fresh almonds and<br /> added some fresh honey to it.

GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide and is one of the ingredients in this product. They are also made to be resistant to high levels of a chemical called glyphosate"
0;Wow made from corn and may contain soy?  That's a double whammy of frankenfood!  I'm sure if people knew the truth about how unwholesome this stuff is they would avoid it like the plague.  What makes it worse is that Kelloggs is trying to hide the truth from the American public by trying to defeat Prop 37 in California which would allow us to make informed decisions about what we feed our families.  Sounds pretty cowardly to me.
0;"""i bought these as a christmas gift for my son. i read one review that mentioned how the cherry flavour tasted like cough syrup and i have to agree. i'm an idiot for ignoring that review because i had a feeling that person would be right. i'm returning them on monday"
0;"""It sounded Good  I prepared it according to directions.  I really love ginger and even used to buy candied ginger.  This is why I was so surprised when I downed a gulp of this drink.  It was really sweet"
0;"""I really tried this with an open mind. I love hot tea in the afternoon as well as other 'soothing' drinks. But this one was a killer. It comes as a powder to mix with hot water. It doesn't say how much water on the packet so I assumed that one packet is for one cup of water (as per the directions on this site).<br /><br />One sip put me into the gag zone. I'm sorry to say that it was horrible. It was bitter"
0;"""This drink tasted absolutely awful to me.  I don't think I could even force myself to drink this if offered big bucks to do so.  I took one sip and cringed.  The taste was awful and very bitter.  I tried to force myself to take another sip but I could barely get it past my lips.  It was horrible.  My husband tried it and so did my daughter and neither of them like it either.  The smell was really bad as well.  Just smelling it made me want to get sick.  I know this is a harsh review but it's 100% honest.<br /><br />I've never had a Ginger & Lemon drink before but"
0;"""I do not understand how anyone with actual working tastebuds can stomach this drink. I could barely swallow it without gagging. It made me nauseated and left a nasty taste in my mouth for hours. Just makes me cringe"
0;I wasn't sure what to expect with the Ginger & Lemon drink but it was worse than I thought it would be. It tastes pretty bad. My and husband and I both tasted it and neither of us could finish it. It doesn't have a good flavor at all. My husband said it tasted like cold medicine. And it does. The nicest I could say is that it slightly tastes like a cough drop which is a little better than tasting like cold medicine.
0;I'm not a huge ginger fan but its okay and I love lemon so I decided to try this. I was highly disappointed with this drink. The taste is awfully bitter and spicy. There is so much ginger in this that it actually made my tongue burn and I only used a half of packet. I can't imagine the burning sensation if I would of used an entire packet of this stuff.  It also leaves a nasty bitter aftertaste in my mouth. I took one sip of this and that is all I could take of it. I wanted to like this drink but it's just not for me.<br /><br />The only good things I can say about Gold Kili beverage is that it's an instant drink and it mixes up really well in your glass.
0;"""I really was surprised at how bad this stuff really was.  When I ordered it I figured with ingredients like ginger and lemon that it would make a satisfying hot wintertime drink.  But alas it was downright terrible. I heated the right amount of water as per its directions and found it extremely strong and bitter.  So I added more water and mix and this time added some honey for flavor and still found it too strong"
0;"""I was looking forward to trying this drink because I have a tea I love that is ginger and peach combined.  When I opened the pouch the first thing I noticed was the smell.  It smelled terrible... the word I would use is repugnant.  I went ahead and boiled water and poured it in the cup.  The powder mixed easily with the water and it looked like tea.  My first sip was my last.  It was so spicy that my eyes watered"
0;"""I am always a little cautious with beverage mixes so I used half a packet in the recommended 1 cup of hot water (50% recommended strength)<br /><br />It was so extremely ginger bitter that I couldn't take it.  So I added another cup of hot water.  I managed to keep drinking it but only about half way (this is at 25% strength).  I ended up just dumping it.<br /><br />I haven't drank any more - if you like chewing pickled ginger or something like that maybe you'll like this but it is NOT like ginger tea - it's not subtle and it's extremely bitter.  Could smell the lemon - could only taste ginger.<br /><br />Not at all for me.  I'll try to pawn off what I have left on someone else but my boyfriend won't take it either.  He tasted a sip of mine said  it's okay  and then refused to drink any more"
0;"""I have never had a drink with such a strong aftertaste and odor. And to add insult to injury -- it's hot and perfumes the air with an acrid smell. I seriously had to open a window after brewing this. I didn't get a hint of lemon or of ginger"
0;"""I wanted to try this drink mix in club soda rather than as a hot drink.  It did dissolve well into the cold club soda.  I expected the bitter taste of ginger despite that this product is already sweetened.  I did taste just a bit of the lemon flavor.  It is not at all overpowering.  However"

0;I bought these trying to get away from having chips sent by my ex-wife. The price quoted $10.23 for shipping but when I got the email confirmation I was charged $26.49 to have it sent to an APO for a grand total of $47.00 for 4 bags of chips. 12.00 per bag of chips?????? Rediculous. I haven't even got them yet and unless every chip is unbroken this was a total waste of money. I'll go back to bugging the ex and get a suprise gift of candy for alot less. I know this is to rate an item but until they come up with rate a seller this will have to do.

Nutricity said I did in fact receive what I ordered because the UPC on the jar of sauce matched the UPC on the item listed. I informed them and even took pictures of the items description"
0;First impression when I opened these - hmmm. They smell like paint thinner. Not the most enticing smell (y'don't say!) but I gave it a shot anyway.<br /><br />They're super greasy and have a really strange chemical taste to them. The green beans are especially awful.<br /><br />I'd skip these and buy the TERRA brand exotic vegetable chips instead.

I kept on checking the delivery tracking because I was concerned it might not arrive on time. It did not arrive on time. In fact it didnt arrive at all. Very very disappointed. I ended up sending a gift card.
0;I emailed the company several times they never emailed back i left about 5 voicemails because they never picked up the phone they left me very unsatisfied The Online Candy Shop ships damaged goods it came on October 8th 2010 so it wasn't hot outside so why was every candy melted and the ones i sampled tasted disgusting i recommend ordering this product from a different store.

0;"""There may not be much inflation in the economy but there has been in the Amazon customer ratings. I can remember when a  4  from 10 or more people was close to a lock when it comes to product adequacy. This product's cumulative rating should have meant that Eight O'Clock French Roast would at least be drinkable"
0;This coffee is terrible. It neither smells nor tastes like a true French Roast coffee. For anyone who has had the pleasure of drinking the standard coffee in a French cafe (as in France) or if you buy French Roast beans from a quality roaster you will HATE this stuff. I cannot imagine why Amazon sells it.

0;"""I have been buying Zico's mango flavored coconut water for several months now but last 2 packs I received did not taste the same. It tasted as if it had gone bad/expired/etc. Normally this is a great product but after receiving two bad batches"
0;I bought this item loving the way it tasted in the 11.2 ounce packages but opting for more drink for your buck I went ahead and order a case of the 14 ounce plastic bottle zico. Bad Idea after my first taste I was unhappy the coconut water tasted like the plastic bottle. If you buy this product definately opt for the tetra packed 11.2 ounce product.
0;"""I was quite excited to try the 14 ounce bottle of Zico coconut water and much to my dismay when it finally came and I got a chance to try it I was royally disappointed. The coconut water has a plastic bottle aftertaste and it is quite unpleasant. I had one and will never drink another... too bad I bought 2 twelve packs. Get your water in those aseptic containers"
0;"""I was sooo initially excited about pre-ordering on amazon.com before it was available.  Then someone posted a not so good review from this same product in store and I was concerned.  Customer service said non-returnable item once shipped because it is considered perishable item.  My order just came"
0;"""I wanted to try this out because I've heard a lot of good things about Coconut Water and it sounded sweet and tasty.<br /><br />However...it's surprisingly bitter and not...very good at all. I am basically forcing myself to finish the bottle. Adding a spoonful of sugar has actually helped it a lot. Regardless"

It gave me and my girlfriend heart burn.<br /><br />Natural coconut water is better than concentrate.
0;"""I grew up drinking real coconut water.  This product doesn't even come close.  I will not buy it ever again.  Read the product description - it's  produced domestically from concentrate.   IT JUST DOESN'T TASTE LIKE REAL COCOCNUT WATER."""
0;I have eight of these bottles sitting in my cupbard and unfortunately I cannot get myself to drink them. Awful after taste in the plastic bottle. Will not buy this product again. The boxed version tastes much better.
0;"""I don't know where to start. I feel like cheated. This product is described as  Pure Premium Coconut Water  but it tastes more like little bit of coconut oil mixed with water and served in a cheap plastic container. This product does not at all taste like coconut water. When you take a sip the first thing it reminds you of is  Plastic .<br /><br />I have tried many brands of coconut water and this by far is the WORST. I have grown up drinking coconut water fresh from the shell. So I know the real taste. See my  review for  Vita Coco .<br /><br />I had seen all the recent negative reviews. But they all suggested that there was a problem with one particular batch. I also noticed that Amazon had stopped selling this to investigate the problems reported in recent bad reviews. So when this product again came up for sell I trusted that Amazon has addressed the issue. I was always attracted to the packaging and wanted to try this for some time. Plus there was 15% off coupon. So I went ahead and ordered a case. Big Mistake!!<br /><br />Amazon does not accept returns for this product. So only thing I can do is  vent it out  through this review. This is my first negative review and I believe Zico absolutely deserve NO STARS. I am giving one star because Amazon does not allow zero stars.<br /><br />BTW"
0;I used to love the old Zico when it went straight from the coconut into the container.  Now that it's made from concentrate it tastes weak and spoiled.  This will be my last box of ever of Zico.  I'll be going back to O.N.E. or Vita Coco.
0;"""Was so excited when I saw Zico had 14 oz containers of coconut water. This is not the original formulation. It is disgusting. It is like it has been boiled down into a concentrate and then water added. It tastes terrible & odd and has WAY too much packaging than the original style. Not thirst quenching at all.... makes me nauseous. Buy the brand  One .<br /><br />Stay away from this product. Total waste of money."""
0;"""Zico used to be my coconut water of choice. When I first saw the new packaging I was excited that it would be easier to close and store. I was shocked when I tasted it - it is NOT the same product! The taste really turned me off. I've since switched to O.N.E. coconut water.<br /><br />I also determined that the new bottle size is too big of a serving. I like to drink coconut water before going to the gym because I've found it helps with endurance. It is not as convenient for me to carry the larger (by about 3 oz.) bottle"
0;"""I absolutely love the plain Zico Coconut water - I drink at least 1 or 2 of the large tetrapaks a week.  I have also enjoyed some of the other brands Mango flavored coconut water (O.N.E. and Vita).  So the logical progression was to try the Zico Mango.<br /><br />ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. You can't taste the Coconut"
0;Zico has changed this product so that it no longer tastes like coconut water.  When the company used Brazilian coconuts it was an entirely different tasty product from what it is now with coconuts from Thailand.
0;"""I recently purchased one of these from my local supermarket. I thought the flavor of the box version of zico was ok so I figured they just redesigned their package...Boy was I wrong!<br />I took a sip and as fast as the liquid entered my mouth"
0;I am shocked that anyone would pay a whopping 2.50 a bottle for this stuff.  It tastes horrible and I cannot imagine ever reaching for it to rehydrate myself for any reason.  I know the benefits of coconut water but there must be one that tastes better than this!
0;"""The taste is bad.. plus it is from concentrate so I dont think it has the same work out<br />recovery effects.<br />Now dont get me wrong Zito had a great idea on being able to take the drink to the gym or<br />biking"
0;I loved the old Zico water in the square containers and couldn't wait for Amazon to get this in. I got the two cases I ordered today and it tastes terrible! It actually tastes like plastic or some sort of chemical/pesticide. Even after chilling it and pouring into a glass it is still not drinkable. Do not waste your money on this if you like real coconut water. Try the O.N.E. coconut water instead. It was my second favorite until now and I will never buy another bottle of ZICO.<br /><br />Who cares if you can recycle the bottle if the product is not fit to drink? What a waste of $60!
0;"""This was dissapointing. So much so that I wouldnt waste another second on talking about it except to say Im tossing the product because it was lacked any taste whatsoever and I wouldnt want to inflict the nothing on another being. Stick with Water"
0;I'm sure the flaw with this product is with coconut water in general and not with Zico. I gasped when I first sipped this drink. There is a strange saltiness in the taste and the passion fruit and orange peel are barely perceivable.<br /><br />Amazon was kind enough to refund me the cost of this order. Lesson to be learned: try to find a sample of a product before you buy a case of it.
0;"""This coconut water has a very weird smell and a bad after taste like its an old coconut.  The other coconut water I have had is the Vita coco and it's not bad but it's better than this Zico.  Zico does not taste fresh at all.  If you don't breath"
0;I misread the label.  I was looking for real juice - not some water-down passion fruit flavoring.  It's like buying fruit punch when you actually want fruit juice.  And this is expensive coconut water.
0;I had heard a lot about coconut water and thought I would give this a try.  I wish I had tried a bottle locally rather than buying multiple bottles through Amazon.  The taste of this is really bad and has a cloying aftertaste.  If you haven't already tried this product I would recommend getting a small bottle from a local health food store first.
0;The old Zico was delightful.  This new version is so aweful as to be totally undrinkable.  I am now watering my plants with it.  How did they manage to ruin a parfeclty good product. Is Zico now owned by Pepsico?
0;There is a problem with the way the manufacturer attaches the spouts to the actual box of coconut water.  There is always one box out of the six pack that is leaking.  Today the coconut water was leaking through the actual box it came in.  I am cancelling my Subscribe and Save to this product.
0;"""This is the product that rocked my world... In a bad way. After buying this I realized that some companies (and people) will do anything for a profit - like rip off their fellow man.  Here's how....<br /><br />Zico used to be real 100% coconut water. Now"
0;"""This is the first time I have tried this product.  I have never had the original formula so I can't compare it to what was a highly rated product.  At first the taste is somewhat pleasant but not very natural tasting and then there is a lingering aftertaste.  I will not buy this again and do not recommend it.  I want to try other brands. I think I will enjoy it because coconut water is not very sweet"
0;First sip had me feeling sick!  I'm not sure if it is because I just don't like Passion Fruit or because I don't like Passion fruit and coconut water.  I really wanted to like this flavor but luckily Amazon gave me a refund so it wasn't too bad of a deal for me.  I'll stick with the delicious chocolate flavor :).
0;"""This is so gross.  Zico should be ashamed!<br /><br />My reflex pulled the bottle back before too much got in my mouth after it hit my tongue.<br /><br />We gave the rest to my sister to put in her work fridge with a sign that said"

0;I received the Banana Nut Bread soft baked bar in my Influenster Summer Beauty VoxBox and I wasn't that big of a fan of it. I personally do not care for bananas to begin with so I knew that the chances of me liking it would be slim. My mom loved it though.

0;"""I unpacked the box of Old Wisconsin turkey snack bite sausage pieces and put the separate packages on my pantry shelf and kept one out to open and my mouth was watering.  After the first package was consumed I took another package of them out of the pantry and started in on it.  Wasn't too much later in the following week I noticed a pretty unpleasant smell in the pantry.  I thought for sure a rodent had got trapped somehow and probably died and was slowly rotting somewhere I could not see nor could I find anything of the sort.  The smell lasted and I scratched my head and wondered if the dead thing would eventually just dry up. Pretty soon my whole place smelled like the county landfill on a busy day. Well"
0;"""I bought these because I started following the paleo lifestyle and have been trying lots of different grain free snacks. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that this product contains mechanically separated turkey. Also known as pink slime. Yuck! I wish they would have posted the actual ingredients. They taste alright"
0;Wanted to try this brand of chia seeds and althought the packaging and seeds seemed fine enough I almost chipped a tooth from a seed that straggled its way in. That means they don't clean these seeds good. Bummer - guess thats why theyre so cheap.
0;"""Let me share my reaction and compare it to my friend's reaction because we have very different eating habits and lifestyles. We both had a terrible reaction to this product and we both used it sparingly.<br /><br />I eat low-carb and have a sensitivity to sugar (insulin resistance)"

0;I must be careful in the future.  I have been very pleased with all my other Amazon orders.  This was way too costly for small amount you receive. Also the cookies weren't real fresh. No more orders<br /> of this cookie.
0;I guess it might taste okay and I do wish I had heeded earlier reviews because they warned that the product could arrive broken in an olive oil soaked box.  It was true for me last month as well as it was over a year ago.  Didn't anyone get the message?
0;"""The bottle I was unlucky enough to sample was imported by Moet Hennesy. I'm curious if the importer swapped the contents of the bottle. It must be that or Ardbeg has the best hype machine on the planet.<br /><br />The initial aroma is that of rubbing alcohol with a hint of fusel alcohol"
0;"""I haven't tried these and don't plan to. It's no wonder people say they grow on you and are addicting. They contain MSG in the ingredients! Plus three other kinds of hidden MSG! Duh! Not good! Wake up people. These aren't good for anyone"
0;"""Yuck. I'd use a more colorful title for this review than  cheese droppings  that means the same thing but rhymes with  cheese curds  but am not sure that'd make it past Amazon's content policies.<br /><br />You know how if you're baking a pizza or something and some of the cheese falls off and lands directly on the pan"
0;I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews.  This product is pricey for what you get---the little burned piece of cheese on the pan from some cheese dish!  It is so salty and so not worth it.  It's not a taste treat.  It is 1 carb of never-mind.  Do not waste your money or taste buds on this.
0;"""I have purchased this product several times before but this time I was unpleasantly surprised to find the amount of product in the package has shrunk significantly!  The packaging states approximately 22 pieces per bag"
0;I was expecting cheese as it states. I can't even tell you how salty these cheese crisps are. I brought them in to my job has three different people try them and I couldn't give then away. Every person I had try said they were gross.... Please re think this product.
0;I wish I had noticed the list of ingredients before I purchased this product. It is not just cheese. Read the ingredients. MSG is bad for you and there are about 15 ingredients besides the cheese. YUCK! I will throw them out. They don't taste that great either.
0;doesn't taste like ranch at all or good and is pretty much like chewing styrofoam! doesn't have a cheese flavor either! same for the jalapeno.. have yet to try the white cheddar or nacho cheese flavors i also bought but i am sure they will suck as well. i will stick to my pork rinds because they are low carb and taste good!!!!!!!
0;"""Let's just say if you like eating cardboard with flavor then you'll love this product.  I found the taste to be good but the texture of it was like eating cheese flavored cardboard.  I am not trying to be funny"
0;"""I was hesitant at buying these shiitake mushrooms at first knowing that they were from china.<br />I reasoned with myself that since they were organic that they had to be okay.<br /><br />When i fry them in oil or butter there is such a horrible chemical smell"
0;"""I bought these in bulk so had no choice but to try them for quite a while before giving up.  I just noted that I agreed with review of Ms. Hampton.  They are loaded processed peanut and cocoa butter fats"
0;"""My husband kept buying boxes of these to take to work (thinking it was a good thing) so I also tried them.  Every flavor tastes awful with the peanut butter being the least awful.<br /><br />The worst part"
0;ThinkThin are great bars.  Amazon delivers either stale bars or bars that have been left in a hot warehouse.  I used to take delivery monthly -- no more!  The last 2 shipments were bars that were so dry that they crumbled when the package was open.  I cancelled my standing order.
0;I normally purchase this item in stores but thought I would add to my first Amazon order.<br />I was happy to see you offered them.<br />Clearly they wer old and stale and should not have been offered.
0;"""I buy these bars at Whole Foods all the time but saw them on Amazon for about $5 cheaper and thought  what a deal!   The bars were covered in a white film and tasted stale.  I could not finish the bar.  I won't be purchasing these from Amazon again!  I guess if it sounds too good to be true"
0;I usually buy these from Trader JOes but thought it would be easy to buy a box of them.  The two bars I have opened looked like the chocolate was crumbling off and smearing all over the inside of the package.  They also taste a bit odd.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing.
0;I love the bars themselves and found them less expensive through Amazon so ecided to buy them.  I opened the first bar and notices the chocolate covering was whitish (signify the emulsifiers are breaking down) I bit into it it was nasty tasting like something that was very out of date and stale.  My best guess is improper storange with Amazon or during shipping extreme heat)  I did contact Amazon and they did refund my money on these (well let's see the next statement).  I never shopped for food on line so was a bit leary now more leary.
0;the photo looks great.  Too bad what i got had slivered almonds - not a single whole almond in the box!<br />don't waste your money.  the picture looks NOTHING like what they send. They should have to put up a photo of what it really looks like.  they wouldn't sell any!!!!!  VERY DISAPPOINTED and feel cheated
0;the stuffing was stale.  The recipe and ingredients in the stuffing changed which affected the recipes it waa used in.  Amazon's customer service did not work and corporate never adequately responded.  From the manufacurer to the Shipper to Amazon every part of this transaction was a farce!
0;"""Wow!  I did not know that someone could make a business selling food that tastes so bad!  No wonder these are called Raw Revolution... they taste revolting!!<br /><br />It seriously blows my mind that someone could make a food with chocolate and coconut that tastes so awful.  The first taste is poor"
0;"""I bought a 12 pack of this exact product about 6 months ago.  It was not from this seller.  They were kept in a cool pantry in a kitchen that is always temperature controlled.  I used one right away. It was good. They all say Best By:Jan 27 2012.  Today is Mar 2011. The remaining 11 have all swelled up"

Alas - it is gone - probably for good.<br /><br />For several years I've been seeking out this wonderful item - and no other mint (I'm loyal - for good reason).

0;"""I recently restocked my supply to discover a banner on the box announcing a change in flavor. Bleagh! The once addictive spearmint Altoids taste like a cut-rate wintergreen. Did I say bleagh? Bleagh!<br /><br />I'd hate to see nearly three decades of Altoids pleasure come to an end"
0;"""The new flavor is completely awful.  New and improved  is code for  now using artificial flavoring that doesn't taste like spearmint . Stock up if you can find the originals and avoid the new ones"

They taste just like the peppermint ones.<br />Someone ought to tell them that there is a difference between peppermint and spearmint.<br />I hate peppermint.

0;You will only receive one box of taco shells. In the box is a count of 12. Do not believe the list price or the great sale price or how much the shipment weighs. All of them are wrong. You will end up paying $8.01 for one box of taco shells 12 in the box. This ad should be removed for being soooo miss leading. Who would pay $38.40 for one box of taco shells but that is the list price? What box of taco shells weighs 5.9 pounds but that is what the product details states? In the reviews it is mentioned that you receive 144 taco shells. Add it all up and the ad leads you to believe that you will receive 12 boxes of taco shells. You will NOT.

0;The tree is very ugly... was not cut in away to look like a little tree.. the tree is huge which is nice but has a very very ugly top.. looks like some one potted a bush.. Cheap to buy but nothing like a bonsai. Looks like my 4 year old made this. Sad this was a present. :(
0;The tree was well packaged and came watered.  I will say it was younger then what the picture showed.*updat<br /><br />I unpacked it and put in indirect sunlight and watered as suggested.  All was going well but three weeks later it was dead.<br /><br />Tree traveled from across the country and I am not sure how long it was in the box as it was a gift. But I will say I am not sure this was a factor.<br /><br />Amazon wise I have one good tree still going and one dead tree......<br /><br />*update*<br /><br />Well now.

0;"""The food is GREAT.  The cats have gotten completely addicted to it.  BUT....what Amazon doesn't bother to mention is that  quantities are limited .  I have been buying this food for my 3 cats for about 6 months.  It comprises roughly half their diet (or 3 cats/day).<br /><br />I just went to re-order and was repeatedly told  there's a problem .  Long story"
0;my cats hate this cat food. I have never seen them turn their nose up at anything. It's terrible. I had it on recurring delivery and cancelled it and was shocked when it arrived again. They refused the return! I am very disappointed. My cats won't eat it and I can't send it back and didn't intend to reorder a second time. GRRRR

0;We have 6 cats and 2 dogs presently and they all get Newman's Own Organics.  The only one we have had our cats walk away from is the 3 oz can of Turkey Formula for cats.  They love the 5.5 oz. can of Turkey and the other two selections.  They also love the 3 oz. chicken and salmon.  The only difference besides the size of the cans is that in the middle of the turkey formula 3 oz. cans there is now a dark pink or reddish colored spot(that was not there originally) that is not in the 5.5 oz can.  All the other dry and can food varieties are very nutritious and are eaten very quickly.
0;The Newman's Own Organics 2nd Generation Turkey & Vegetable has changed the ingredients from Turkey Liver to Pultry Liver.<br />This is not good if your cat is allergic to Chicken as ours is.<br />The Newman's Own Organics Turkey & Vegetable original is no longer available.
0;I went back and forth on getting my girls some of the beef flavored Newmans because 2 of the 3 can't eat chicken.  I am always looking for a good quality food to add to their rotation.  There was a pretty good sale on the beef flavored a few days ago so I bought it.  I opened a can to give them for their dinner and I absolutely could not give that to my girls!  It had an awful grey color to it and was the consistency of wall paper paste.  My cats like to chew their food not lick it up so I knew they would have an awful time with this one.  Newman's has changed.  I have tried most of the flavors over the years and I have noticed that the cans are underweight and seem to have almost as much rice as pate in them.  Will not be buying again but thank heaven for Amazon that always makes it right without any hassles.
0;While the ingredients look good (though the water content is 80% while most of the better brands have 78%) this food has managed to get two of my dogs sick!  Vomiting and uncontrollable bowel movements.  One dog is 17 yrs old and the other 4 yrs old.  I stopped feeding the older girl this food some time ago but discovered I still had cans so I gave a can to the 4 yr old.  After two days on the food he became sick.  He is now on rice and chicken for the next few days.  I cannot recommend this food to anyone.
0;"""Was told by an employee in a pet store that this brand is one of the best. Bought from them and then purchased at Amazon (cheaper). My dog wasn't to happy with the beef selections. After reading the label"
0;"""So I jumped right in and read the reviews. Half good...half bad. These crackers are by far the worst tasting low carb crisps I have tried and the most expensive. maybe it was me? I gave one crisp to 3 other people and they all spit them out. They concur...gross. Grainy texture and dries your mouth out immediately after putting in mouth. Smells nasty. Guess what their return policy is?? No problem as long as you return the package in an  unused and resaleable  condition. Now how do you do that when you first try them? What a joke. Not even an offer of % off next purchase or exchange or anything other than your S.O.L.!! Buyer beware here for sure. Amazon should resist having sellers with this kind of return policy on products."""

0;This product has changed its safflower source.  I called the company today after receiving my order - which label did not match that on the company website within the past week.  They say that now the website is correct. It has only has 2g of polyunsaturated fats which is well below the 7-11g per serving that Dr Oz recommends for aid in reducing belly fat.  It is a great oil if you want it for cooking.  I am canceling my auto ship.
0;"""This bottle looked exactly like the front label that is on a current bottle of Hollywood safflower oil I have. They do not show you the back label where it states amt. of polyunsaturated fat (only 2 when needed 7+)"
0;I bought this product soley bcuz it said it had 11 of polyunsaturated fat!<br />Received it today and the label says it only has 2.  I'm really ticked off that<br />I wasted my money on this.  Amazon should automatically have to refund anyone that bought this
0;I bought this product for the fiber in prune juice to aid in my son's constipation. Compared to regular prune juice which has about 1.5 g fiber in 4 oz this juice has 0 g fiber in the same volume. The ingredients just list apple and prune juice but don't list how much of each. Clearly it's more apple than prune. If your kid likes to drink apple and prune juice then this product is fine but if you're looking for something to help with constipation you should look elsewhere.  What a waste.
0;"""First of all this stuff is Cinnamon Leaf Oil and NOT Cinnamon Bark Oil. Olive nation is misleading people by not making it clear that this is Cinnamon leaf Oil. Even the label on the bottle they sent is different to the one on Amazon. Don't get me wrong"
0;After reading the add copy I was expecting a much higher quality<br />(read this as better tasting) cinnamon oil.<br />The flavor was lacking and dissipated too quickly<br />when exposed to air.<br /><br />For the price I expected better.<br />I would not order again.<br />thanks

0;I bought these chicken treats after receiving several articles about dogs getting sick from other chicken breast treats that we're made in China.  I bought these specifically because they were made in the USA and I assumed they would be safe.  They were so hard I could barely break them and my dog wasn't chewing them well.  He started choking on a piece while eating it and that was the end of that.  These are terrible and dangerous.  The pieces are so sharp I became concerned about him cutting an intestine or something.  Now I make my own chicken treats.  It's pretty easy and I know exactly what is in them.
0;I have little yorkies so I generally take products like this and cut into smaller portions.  This stuff was so hard if you tried to snap in half it crumbles away a big portion of the piece.<br />I finally put it on a cutting board and when I tried to cut with a meat clever I got scared the knife was gonna slip sideways.  The pieces still crumbled.  I mean we are talking serious dry.<br />This product is touted as quality and american.  This product is much more expensive yet is the worst I've ever purchased.  It is like it was outdated.<br /><br />Do not buy this product.  It is poor value

0;My family loved the Raspberry and Blueberry sauces so when I saw this one at the store I just had to try it.  What a disappointment!  I marinated chicken to grill and everyone agreed it was bland and blah.  I've heard that you can mix the sauces with oil and vinegar to make salad dressing so maybe this would be okay on a salad but it's flavor isn't stong enough to stand up to chicken.  I'd say skip this one and buy the Raspberry or Blueberry ones instead!

0;The other oysters from this company are raised in South Korea but these are from China!  Do not buy them!  And you can't return them even still in the bag they were shipped in.

I am used to using green tea that comes in the tea bags and drink several cups per day so I was excited to see if I would like these. I just opened one and drank a little bit and the first thought that came to mind is rancid. I don't know whether I got a bad batch or not but it tastes nothing like I thought it would. I thought I would get a light tasting traditional green tea but instead took in a mouthful of funky tasting fermented-like liquid. It even smells bad. I somehow will have to stomach power my way through 11 more of these. I don't know if I have the stomach for it....
0;"""This product is not the Oi Ocha product that is sold in Japan. This product appears to be the Koi Ocha product repackaged as Oi Ocha for the USA. I have uploaded the picture to compare this product with the original Oi Ocha. Though I don't have Koi Ocha with me at the moment to verify that this is in fact the repackaged Koi Ocha.<br /><br />Koi Ocha (this product) is not a bad product"
0;I love fresh roasted chestnuts and quite a while back I found some roasted and peeled that were dilicious.  I wish I could remember the name of the company.  I decided to order the Galil chestnuts from Amazon thinking they would be like the ones I had found before.  These were a huge disappointment.  They aren't in the least bit like freshly roasted chestnuts.  They are mushy.  It's as if they had been boiled for hours.  I am now sceptical about ordering another brand of packaged roasted and peeled chestnuts for fear they will be the same.
0;Salmon isn't very good quality compared to fresh smoked salmon I have had in Alaska and Maine. And why is it necessary to have the box made in China?  I would much rather pay a few cents more for an American made product.  Reminds me of how Walmart closed down a rolling pin manufacturing facility near my town in Maine and moved production to china to save 4 cents per rolling pin.  Unbelievable.  Disgusting.
0;"""Let me begin by saying that I really really like Bear Creek Soups!! Best on the market as far as a dry soup mix (in my opinion) BUT they really missed the mark on this one. I expected more of a tex/mex taste I guess. This taste more like a minestrone soup. Nothing  Santa Fe  OR  Chipotle  tasting at all. Now I have 5 more packages I am going to try to figure out what to do with. Will REALLY have to doctor it up to make it tasty for my family."""
0;The Lorann oil is good but the customer service just isnt there.  I ordered 3 bottles on the original order and received one.  Contacted the company I ordered from and was told they would send the rest of the order out a couple of different dates.  It took me almost 3 weeks to get a complete order.  I will order directly from Lorann from now on....
0;"""I purchased the Waggin' Train brand Duck Jerky and my dog became sick immediately. He was throwing up and also began to lose hair on his ear. Luckily I only given about 10 pieces in the week that I purchased the jerky. I immediately stopped giving him the treats since that was the only new item introduced. Lucky for me"
0;I wouldn't purchase these from Amazon or from anywhere. Amazon I am a good customer. Do the right thing and take these unsafe dog treats off your website.<br /><br />There is a Facebook page where you can see all the innocent pets have died. The one thing in common? These treats. [...]<br /><br />[...]
0;"""I ordered 5 bottles and the pump from the Primo Store Oct 2 2012 8:29AM and haven't gotten it yet or an answer to my to emails asking if my ordered shipped. I was intrested to find how this taste against the sodastream diet soda but well see if i ever get it. I found you can order coke"
0;My cats have been eating this food since it came on the market. It was by far their favorite. Retailers no longer carry the product because they claim it was too pricey. I purchased 4 bags on line through Amazon and was disappointed. The bags were ripped and the food looked different than usual.  None of my cats wouldn't eat it. Will never use this service again.
0;"""I was anticipating a product that I had when growing up. What I got was sub-par. The first thing i notice was the sticks were not soft but hard as if the product was out of date. Also I don't know if they have changed the formula"
0;or aspartame. its really gross--very strange bitter sweet taste that make me really wonder what is used to preserve them... formaldehyde? yuck! plus they have 130 calories for 1/3 of a cup--too much added sugar!!! blueberries are supposed to be mildly sweet! now what am i going to do with all these nasty things?
0;"""Amazon should publish the nutrition label for food items.<br /><br />I bought this product because I read that blueberries are suppose to be good for me.<br /><br />Product arrived quickly. About 5 days using the super saver free shipping.<br /><br />Package is the typical re-sealing bag.<br /><br />The berries inside have the same size and texture as raisins.<br /><br />The taste is not like raisins"
0;"""Worst item imitating a food that I have ever eaten.  Taste horrible.  Too sweet.  Texture like gritty gummy bears (gummy bears taste better).  Very high in calories.  Blueberry beer taste more like blueberries than this abomination.  I like a lot of stuff that I buy through Costco (kirkland)"
0;"""I too agree with the other one star reviewer. I thought I was getting a bargain compared to Whole Foods or my local grocery store's over-priced tiny packages.<br />They did not seem dried so much as  preserved . Almost full sized and plump as opposed to the almost currant-like dried blueberries I am used to. the texture was weird"
0;"""Biggest disappointment was the lack of freshness. All the best aromatics were gone. This was evident with the opening of the bag. Even freshly burr-grinding and French-pressing at 205 degrees just couldn't extract the promised espresso flavors! Of the 3-pack"
0;"""DHL did a terrible job with the delivery of my gift box in a timely manner.  I tracked it from a local area for two days and then noticed it went back to Rhode Island for a night and back to the Latham office.  It was finally delivered two days after the stated date.  The contents of the box was all jumbled and mixed together from the  handling.   I will not order from a company that uses DHL again."""
0;I picked this up from my local health food store.  I have tried Stevia and occationally use it in tea or coffee.  I think they used way too much of the sweetner. It was horrible. I wish they just put a lot less of the sugar subsitute.  It did not taste like what it was supposed to.
0;Colas sweetened with stevia- truly a product which has come of age BUT this particular flavor leaves an aftertaste which is identical to cherry cough syrup- YUCK.  I have tried many of the flavors so far and you can see my reviews for them on each flavor- I strongly recommend the Grape (white grape used for flavor- yum) and the Root Beer is real good too- and the Cola and Black Cherry both get a thumbs up also.  But this one- NOPE.  Not sure where the positive reviews are coming from honestly...
0;Bought some ginger ale and black cherry at my local Giant supermarket. Thought they were okay. My wife's favorite is orange which they didn't carry. I ordered a case on Amazon. It was an incredible disappointment. I can honestly say the worst beverage product we've ever tasted. We threw the 21 of the 24 cans we received. It was undrinkable.
0;"""These are tasty POWDERED pecans.  Amazon fulfillment warehouses apparently have an even worse policy: ZERO PADDING in a box.<br /><br />To experience the  quality  of pecans I received place your pecans in a paint shaker for an hour."""
0;I bought the exact same product in the supermarket for a third of the price. I mistakenly thought I was getting more than I could get in the store. My family and I love the flavor but with the cost of shipping we will not be ordering this again.
0;I found these in a local grocery story and wanted to try them before buying a larger quantity here. They were extremely dry so I checked the 'best by' date which was 5 months out so I don't think they were stale. But I needed liquid just to wash this bar down.
0;"""The first shipment was just as ordered.  This last shipment was not the same....the bars went from 1.59 ounce to 0.9 ounce.  The bar says chocolate peanut - not chocolate peanut butter.  The picture looks the same on the packages.  I am very disappointed in this shipment.  We opened all the boxes before we realized the difference"
0;Causes intense cramping and diarria. But I was sorry that they will not let me return other 4 boxes out of the 5 I recieved.  I thought it was a great item and did taste great but it has very bad affect on those senstive to artifcal sweetner as this has in it.
0;I bought my tea from here and it stated that I would get two containers of tea. I did NOT get the second one. I only got one. I like herbalife but I will not but from this person again unless I get my second container of tea.
0;I'm pretty certain any brand of instant coffee is better than this.  We recently moved into a building that has a few of these machines that offer the Columbia and it is just awful (especially considering the premium pricing).
0;What I want to say that this company they delivered my item on time but all item it's almost going to expire less than two months so be careful when you order to make sure that this company will send you a new made items. Imagine that I placed my order middle of October and it was (Wotsits Cheese 280 Pack 240g) and it's expired 26-11-2011 & 17-12-2011 (It's disappointed).
0;"""I had asked for Mazipan for Christmas and received five of these.  But soon I was unhappy.  Not hard at all like the other review said but they didn't taste right.  Also left an odd residue on my hand and stuck to the plate with a slick film.  The ingredients have corn syrup in them"
0;Hellmans no longer tastes like it used to. I read on another website that the water content has increased drastically over the years. I've never used any other brand and usually can tell when something I'm eating has been made with cheaper mayonnaise. Hellman's now tastes like the cheap mayonnaise. I'm trying other brands to see which one I prefer.

0;"""I've been trying various teas since I had to give up coffee years ago (blood pressure problems).  This is the first one that I've questioned whether the dominant taste I perceive is a contaminant.  The taste is quite strong"
0;Not worth the price and the color is misrepresented. I received a pair and they are pumpkin orange.<br />These are overpriced at $149 compared to the KHP Pocket pants which are being discontinued. I own two pair and have worn them for 8 years The prices was $78 and now are out of stock.
0;"""There is no expiration date until the customer service help me to know how to read the produced date on the box.  He said just add 4 month from produced date.  so them will be expired in one month the date I received my 60 packs.  It was not pack in but toss in a big box and many of them look old and beat up.  Low quality.  Craft"
0;"""I was so excited to place this order.  We love Kraft Ranch at our house and I was thrilled to have an easy way to send it in lunches.  I would have guessed that there would be some sort of expiration date on the package or at least the box.  There is not.  The box arrived with many packages broken open.  And guessing from the saturation on the box"
0;I can't describe how awful these chocolates are. We got 'em before Christmas at half-off at a drug store and are giving them away to people we don't like. They manage to combine the texture of stale candy with the taste of hideously sugared cola (without the cola). These chocolates were awful years ago and they haven't improved a bit.

0;"""I should've done more research before buying this product. My dog seemed to have very little appetite when she was on this food. She had skin problems. She had loose stools. Unfortunately I didn't want to believe that it had anything to do with the food. I finally decided to look into it after months of trying to get her to eat it more regularly and found that my problems weren't uncommon with this food. I've since switched her to Blue Buffalo food and her skin problems have gotten better"
0;"""This could be better labeled chicken and dumpling soup.  It does not look like the picture on the label.  The one that I tried had an excessive amount of liquid.  You need a spoon to eat it.  The flavor was OK"
0;I tried this gum b/c it was supposed to be natural.  It must have sat in the Amazon warehouse for a few years.  It tasted really old.  The gum sticks to fillings.  The taste does not last but a few seconds.  I threw it away.<br /><br />I would not recommend this gum.  Yuck.
0;I should have tried it before buying a whole case of it!  The flavor is good but what good is it if you can't chew it??  It sticks to my teeth.  I'm not even exaggerating a little bit....it's impossible to chew.  Very disappointed.
0;"""This is apparently falling into that  love it or hate it  category.  It seems like a good idea.  I love curry.  I love chocolate.  And here was a curry chocolate bar!  Yummy!  But no ...<br /><br />Two great tastes do not always taste great together.  I thought I was really going to like this"

0;I was very excited when my Husband ordered my favorite flowers for Valentine's Day. When I received the flowers none had bloomed yet so I thought that I would have them for at least a week or more. I followed the care instructions exactly but they still wilted and died within only a few short days. They also didn't open at the same time so it never looked like the picture at any point in time. I think next time I will order from a local florist so that I can actually get to see a beautiful bouquet like in the picture.

The first bummer was that there are no nipples included in this 48 pack. The second is that it gives her horrible gas and spit up"
0;This product came in expired and of course stale.  I purchased this for a school party and ended it using it as bird food.  I was very disappointed. The only reason I didn't send it back was because I opened them before tasting it.  I will never buy anything from this seller again.
0;"""product is advertised as box candies but are delivered into cheap plastic bags ( not the fancy candy bags ) and broken as CRUMBS instead of impeccable hard candies.<br />That ruined my Holiday Party as i had intended to use use for stuffings.

0;I've ordered Weruva Paw lickin chicken before and it was great. My last order was a rip off. I've opened 5 cans from the case and each can is 95 percent potato starch gravy. There is VERY LITTLE chicken. I would say there is half a teaspoon of chicken in the whole can. What happened??? I want my money back. I didn't spend good money on gravy.
0;I got this product about a month ago to try it for the first time.  My cat and I were pleased so I got 24 more... what a mistake.. where is the meat???  There is more liquid than meat.  At least 2/3 liquid and a few slivers of chicken.  My cat is seriously crying right now and tapping me on the leg begging for food which usually she just curls up and goes to sleep for awhile after eating. I had to get another brand that I have for emergencies in case food does not arrive on time. I need to have a serious talk with Amazon over this.
0;When I received the packages. The boxes are double. But the inside original box are torn and the 29 cans out of 30 are dented.<br /><br />The quality of the inside of can be fine but the appearance of the product is so bad.
0;This is still good coffee but they have DOUBLED the cost.  Half the price at BBB with a 20 percent coupon.  Also available half what Amazon is now charging @ Target & Walmart (at least it was available there a couple month ago)
0;Beacuse of terrible packaging the plastic bags in the boxes were opened and all my cereal was on a floor making huge mess.<br />I am very dissapointed with this order and I already left my opinion about packaging. If you can go to the store and buy it from the shelf - you will be at least able to try this cereal. I couldn't.
0;I had previously bought various brands of certified organic and extra virgin coconut oil from the Philippines and was very pleased with them. I decided to try an Indian coconut oil. This seems to be the only brand that India makes. It's not organic or extra virgin but I wanted to try it anyways. It is tan in color not like organic coconut oil and it smells like used grease from a frying pan. It smells that way too. I will not purchase this again.
0;the oil shows up in a totally different container and inside apiers to be oil like a 90 weight consistency. four hours after openning it has turned into a burnt smilling waxie crisco looking oil. i was hoping for an oil that would mixed with lavender oil or other therapeutic oils.
0;"""I gave this product one star because it contains carrageenan which research has shown to proliferate cancer in animals. I was very excited to try this since I do not drink regular milk and I wanted a nutrient rich substitute for cow's milk to give my 1 year old son.  My review is not based on taste. I've never tasted this product and it arrived faster than estimated. Although carrageenan is a derivative of seaweed which I always thought was good for me"

0;"""Did the company that makes this product bother offering it to cats first to see if they would even eat it?  My cat won't eat it.  Pixie gives it two paws down. I tried offering it to the starving feral cats outside"
0;I love Paul Newman - so no offense to the man - but I have a male cat and I truly believe this food caused him to get crystals.  Won't buy it again.  Perhaps it would be good for female cats.  Nuff Said.
0;I've ordered Greenies two times now and both expire within a week of receiving them. I sent the first one back and won't see my money for 4-6 weeks. Guess I have to do the same yet again. Spend the extra dollar at the grocery store to be sure they aren't going to expire before you can use them. I don't plan to feed my one dog 30 greenies before they expire on the 4th.
0;The packaging was intact and all but when I opened the box I found that the greenies were stuck together and wouldn't break apart (even when I tried smashing them against the concrete). At some point they must have been moist that they had become so cemented together.  It is a struggle trying to pull one at a time out of the bag and they break apart. Not exactly what I wanted.

0;"""I used to buy these treats years ago for my dogs but then was unable to find them at the pet store that used to carry them. When I found them here I decided to get them again being how much my furry friends enjoyed them in the past. While I received my order quickly I was immediately disappointed when I saw the date on the box read  BEST BY: APR 2010  - it is now February 2011. There is no way that is acceptable to send to customers EXPIRED products and I will not be giving these to my dogs now as it's a safety issue. I requested a full refund from this seller but have yet to get any response whatsoever. How disappointing! Hoping Amazon will help with this. Awful buying experience. Beware you may be getting an expired box if you buy these."""
0;This is certainly a blend - not much Kona flavor.  I realize it is easier for the coffee makers to make pricing the same for all blends - I'd be willing to pay more for more KONA!  Tim's Kona blend is much tastier...

0;I researched some of the ingredients on this item and i found that powdered bonito is a fish derivative however the ingedients listed on the page here only says powdered bonito but on the actual package it says powdered bonito(fish).I think the people who sell this item should modify the ingredient listing on this page.
0;This product was so misrepresented that I no longer use Amazon as my first choice when I'm looking for a product.  I ended up spending my gift certificate and was totally ripped off for 3 packs of nuts that I can purchase in a store for $5.  Don't be fooled by this product no matter how they try to dress it up.
0;"""I read the positive reviews and I really liked the price so I ordered these rawhide chips. My yellow Labrador Retriever weighs 80 lbs and daily gets a rawhide chip (primarily Walmart generic brand) as a treat in the evening for years.  My Lab will eat everything in sight (including socks) and never has stomach problems. After giving him only four rawhide chips in two days"
0;I have a black lab/border terrier mix.  She hasn't had any problems with any other rawhide (even the cheap brands).  These made her violently sick with excessive vomiting and diarrhea (I was up all night taking her out every 20 minutes).  This went on for 24 hours with no signs of stopping. She became severely lethargic.  She wouldn't drink water or eat food and our vet decided that we should bring her in to put her on fluids because she became so dehydrated.  In the end it cost $175 in vet bills.  Today she is back to normal and the rawhides are at a garbage dump somewhere.<br /><br />Amazon refunded our money with no problems whatsoever and I would still highly recommend them to consumers.
0;"""This was a first purchase of this product and the description sounded great along with the price. The product I normally purchase was not available. Within a half day of having eaten just one or two of the chips my dog has developed diarreah each time (about four times now).  Definitely not normal and has not occurred with other rawhide products.  I'm sure it's this product that is triggering it.  No issues since I have discontinued using. Does have a bad odor in the bag.  I will be discarding and unfortunately can't even consider donating to rescue groups.  It's not an allergy"
0;I would give this negative stars.  Used to get these on auto delivery and dog loved them.  Haven't bought in a while so when they arrived I was surprized to discover a WARM bag with discolored chews (light brown).  Opened the bag and was almost knocked down by a STRONG methane/urine smell. DISGUSTING! Didn't even bother returning.  Threw them out immediately.  Good-bye $26 bucks.
0;"""I like the version of this cereal that is made by the competitor of this cereal and eat it periodically. I tried this hoping to find a very similar product that I could buy on sale if the other wasn't. The other option was a cereal that was so different that it would  become a new option for me.<br /><br />The taste was adequate. The nuts were almost nonexistent....at least to the naked eye. They may have been rolled in dust"
0;My dog loved them but I was very disappointed when I saw the small print noting that the product was made in China.  I will not purchase this product again.  China has a dismal record regarding food safety and I am shocked that this company would produce this product in China.  At least let people know in your product description.

0;Bought these at my local pet store not even thinking to look at where they're made (because everything in that place is usually super high quality stuff).  Came here to see what others think and that's when I saw the other reviews about being made in China - CAN NOT believe I bought these.  My dog has had one and now they're in the trash.  DO NOT give these to your dog!!!  0 stars

0;"""I would agree with the other one star review which described this product as vile. That refers to the taste. It was no where near the pull date. I eat a lot of beets and consume beet juice. It doesn't have to taste like this. I also felt a bit unwell after taking it. It's going down the drain.<br /><br />Other reviews are ok"
0;These bay leaves have absolutely no fragrance and will be useless for cooking.  I am disappointed because I wanted to love this brand of organice spices. Now I am leary of buying any other spices from them.
0;I bought this catnip because I couldn't find the brand I wanted on Amazon. I opened it immediately but the cat won't go near it. I've tried different ways to get her to interact to no avail. I would save your $5 and buy another brand. There is nothing spectacular about this product.

I couldn't find the same brand but this  Xtreme  catnip sounded like it might do the trick.  Not even close.  My husband swears he saw our cat lift up his paw and yawn after smelling it.  If your cat is like mine you'll probably get a better reaction out of any other catnip out there."""
0;Did not ship well. Returned and had 3 more reshipped. Two out of three were once again opened and contents spilled all over. My cats don't like it nearly as much as what I can pick up for less at WalMart. Was seriously disappointed.
0;It fails to meet my expectations.  I bought it because of the great reviews it had and the supposedly good taste and smell.  But let me tell you that's not the case.  While it's smells is not bad.  Taste like regular white rice. I tried cooked Washed and Unwashed. It was very sticky.  I have had Jasmine rice before that tastes and has a way better aroma than this.  I will not be buying this again.
0;"""Why would someone decides to package glass jars of $11 a piece in the box in which they ship books(you know those flat  boxes  that have just a flap for a top and the bottom). Box showed up with   Received Unsealed  stamped all over it. Two jars leaked out"
0;I love cheese-flavored snacks and I was highly disappointed by these. Their styrofoam texture was offset only by putrid tang of faux cheese powder. I'm pretty sure the only good Smart Fries flavor is salt and vinegar.
0;"""Gourmet Basics indeed! I think the basics are to keep it simple and let the natural flavor of the food shine through. I am blown away that they have actually managed to make a  natural food  taste faker than <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00346J90Y >Andy Capp Hot Fries"

0;"""I thought these were a good bargain but these particular models are really bad. I've used fart bags before and these don't small at ALL! They are really weak. The writting has spelling mistakes (who cares) but just feels they are really bad quality. Save your money"
0;THIS WAS THE WORST TASTING FLAVORING I EVERY USED IN MY BAKING CAREER.  I EVEN LET OTHER PROFESSIONAL BAKER TRY IT AND THEY ALL AGREE ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE TASTE OF THIS PRODUCT. I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE AN REFUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Tasted it and it does not taste anything like kalamata Ive had before.<br />4.  The description on site says 100% kalamata.<br />Sending it back.....<br />UPDATE<br />The same day I wrote this review I was contacted by Mr. Alexander Mallas"
0;"""I just bought Bigelow Green Tea and would advise anyone purchasing this product to read the country of origin which is  Product of China .  The write up says that the product is blended and distributed in the USA"
0;This dill weed came in a sealed package but it must have sat around for a very long time.  The dill weed did not have any smell or taste.  It was basiclly some green organic material.  Not very useful for cooking.  I have ordered other Frontier products in the past that have been just fine.  Perhaps it is just this supplier.  Recommend you buy from another source.
0;"""There are no instructions as to how to prepare the bottle for use. It seemed straight forward but apparently I opened the hole too wide and instead of  drops  it poured out in a stream. It didn't go over well with my cat. It made a huge mess. Yes"
0;"""Got this sample box as a gift with my new espresso machine and I have tried about 4 of the pods. Some are expired which things happen I understand so eh. However the four kinds I have tried which were not expired have been just awful. I haven't been able to finish a single cup I have even resorted to ripping the pods out and trying to add and tamp it myself to see if that would help. I think the espresso that we get in this sample pack is just nasty stuff. Also I did not get all the brands pictured. Basically I don't think the price was worth what I got for the money that was spent I felt really bad telling the person who bought this for me they wasted their money :|<br /><br />Update -  yes already"
0;There is a program problem. This product is NOT for Nespresso but keeps coming up when you search for Nespresso. I had to return the products and the vendor confirmed this happens often. Can Amazon correct the misleading links??<br /><br />Steve S.
0;I bought this product with the hope that it would rival the Pomegranate Jelly my Mom's neighbor made from her home grown and harvested pomegranates.  It wasn't even close.  This jelly had no pomegranate flavor at all.  It tasted like sugar jelly.
0;"""Not only did it get to me after several weeks but the amount was so much smaller than anticipated as the jar was 3/4 filled. I can go to the most expensive gourmet food purveyor in Los Angeles and get better quality salt from Il de Re for far less money. Also"
0;"""I got several packages of this and I will never order it again. I put in my pantry and a week later started to notice a sour smell in there. I could not pin point it but when I went to make soup that afternoon pulled out one of these and it was all moldy! The seal had broken in shipment and another had been leaking. It was a terrible mess"
0;I used to live in Cincinnati and I was excited to taste that Cincinnati Skyline Chili again...this is not it.  It was not a bad taste but it was not what I was expecting.  I would not recommend this for anyone who knows Cincinnati chili.

Wish it was said in the description because here I lost 15.69 for one pound of wet fish (thought it was dried but it came with lot of water as the weather is hot I am also afraid it might have gone bad with such hot weather.<br /><br />Again"
0;I agree with the other reviewer. I bought this from a local store because I could not wait to try it....the flavor sounded so good. What a letdown!!! I was choking after the first sip from the completely awful taste! Don't waste your money like I did.
0;The Haribo gummi bears were all stuck together and horrible. This is the worst experience that I have had with Amazon. The worst part of the whole process is that I cannot return the defective product.
0;"""I received the Gummy Bears today and couldn't wait to  gum them  but they were hard and not  gummy  at all.  The package stated   best if used by September of 2012 .  I think it should have said best if used by 2000!!  I think they were old!! I couldn't send them back because they were opened.  I definitely don't want to get more of them every month so need to figure out how to discontinue the automatic resend!!"""
0;I don't know if I got a bad bag or what from the good reviews I have read but these were the toughest gummi bears I have ever had.  They were hard to chew to the point where your mouth would begin to hurt.  I still have about four pounds remaining after a couple months now since they aren't enjoyable to eat.  The taste isn't the greatest either unless you let them set in you mouth for a while but the toughness just makes them very unenjoyable.  Maybe its just a bad bag but I have no reason to say these are good if they weren't and that is my experience so far.
0;"""Unfortunately these came up in my search for German gummy bears but when they arrived they were the US version complete with artificial colors and flavors.  Real German gummies use all natural colors and flavors so they taste much better.  Haribo makes crappy US candy"
0;"""I ordered the gummi bears and I recieved a gummi blob. I contacted amazon and they said they would sent me another order for free.<br />  Guess what?! I now have two gummi blobs.<br />  If you live in a warm climate"
0;"""This was supposed to be a christmas present for my best friend and when he received the package the package of gummy bears had already been opened somehow and there were about 100 gummy bears in the bottom of the box. I am extremely disappointed that the package was shipped this way. And by the looks of it"
0;"""So I dump my bag of wheat into my existing half full wheat bucket and find the package littered with what seems to be little black seeds of some sort- definitly not wheat!!! Not bugs- but perfectly shaped little black balls.  I have looked for an answer online with no luck...I tried calling the manufacture and the office was closed- I have yeast proofing on the counter that I now have to dump- and my good wheat is now mixed in with the  bad .....so basically I'm out of dinner"
0;"""These noodles just arrived yesterday and I now know the secret of their weight loss properties: they will have you throwing up all night. I ate some of these for dinner last night and though I didn't really like them I thought I could at least tolerate them but I started feeling very full after I'd eaten a small ammount (which I thought was a good thing at the time) and ended up waking up at 2am this morning with intense stomach pain"
0;Terrible product. the bananas were brown and had an 'off' taste. when I looked at the ingredients it said product from china. well that answered it. threw them out. won't eat stuff from China. what a waste.
0;"""My son has eaten the Earth's Best fruits and veggies in the past and loves them so I thought I'd try the soups.  Epic fail!  He generally will try anything and will even eat a few things he's not a total fan of.  I've never seen him actually spit food out and continue to spit to get the taste out of his mouth.  Once I realized what he was doing"
0;I don't consider myself to be a coffee gourmet but I found this very bland and boring much like the coffee beans from big bins in a supermarket where you stick the bag under the spout and fill the bag.  I would not re-order this and don't recommend this blend.  The first coffee from Amazon that I can't recommend.
0;"""The treat looks cute and price is inexpensive. It was on sale for $1 at my local PetSmart. I gave it 1 star because my cat refuses to eat it. He just sniffs and walks away. I have been looking for a soft treat for my cat as he has sensitive gum. He loves the Friskies Tender Hairball Treats"
0;"""I really wanted to like this mix but was sadly disappointed.  I found it to be heavy and as someone else said mealy.  It was quite dry.  Noone in the family enjoyed it and it was my son's birthday cake.  Try <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NLY0QE >Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Vanilla Cake Mix"
0;I made this cake for Christmas 2008.  My family thought this cake was dry and said that didn't taste good.  It actually left a bad aftertaste in the mouth.  I frosted it with Cherrybrook Kitchen Chocolate Frosting Gluten Free and they loved that.  They did not want me to ever repeat this cake but they said they would be happy to have the frosting again.
0;Got a 12 pack of these on sale from amazon warehouse and figured it was worth trying for cheap. My girlfriend who loves most things pizza flavored was the first to try and she said they are crap. Very little flavor at all and what is there really can't be related to pizza. Not worth going for at any price.
0;It is a product of China. If I had known I would not have ordered it. For those of you that share my concerns you will find the information useful. As for the rest of you - ignore this review - or - do some research on the safety of what is comeing out of China.
0;"""Can't get past the fact that these are made in China.  I'm surprised at the  organic  food imported from China.  I check EVERY label now --- recently I even found several organic frozen veggies from China---broccoli for one.  Also"
0;"""My children and I have had the Strawberry Banana Crisps and have loved them.  But after a while they started to pick out just the strawberry pieces.  So when I saw they had a plain strawberry option here I was thrilled.  When they arrived I was shocked to find out that unlike the strawberry banana variety"
0;"""My daughter loves this product and often purchases it from a local specialty market.  But they are very pricey and this seemed a better way to purchase them.  But what we got was something that looked the same"
0;I was so excited to get these.  I figure they would taste along the lines of the dehydrated strawberries you find in cereal.  I was completely wrong.  When I opened the package it smell terrible and tasted even worse.  It didn't even taste like strawberries.
0;Made in China! Food quality and growing conditions concern me.  Packages are full of small broken pieces. Couldn't tell how many of each fruit were in the 12 count variety box. Thought there'd be 4 of each flavor...Only 2 pears and 2 strawberries - rest were apples.  Taste is very good but never would have bought if I'd known the origin. Not sure where packaging failed but broken tiny pieces aren't what my 1-year old grandson wants. USA doesn't have fruit???  Won't buy again.
0;"""Based on the recommendation of my sister-in-law I ordered a couple of boxes of the Brothers-all-natural fruit crisps.  I also ordered the Kirkland brand as well.  I would have to say that I prefer the cheaper Kirkland brand over the more expensive Brothers brand.  I am not sure if the Brothers brand is supposed to taste stale or not but at least two of the packages that I have tried have tasted stale and not crisp as advertised.  The expiration date on the individual packages is 01-06-14 which leads me to believe that this brand either taste this way or I just got a bad batch.  Nonetheless"
0;There was a horrible smell to the formula that only intensified when mixed as directed. My son refused to get anywhere near this formula. I thought he was over reacting so I tried to taste it and nearly lost my lunch! Seemed like a great product until we recieved it. Save your money any find something else. Got this product because it was labeled gluten free. For other celiacs out there... enfamil is totally gluten free as well and my son was happy to drink it.
0;I agree with the previous reviewer.  The formula smelled like the metal can it was packaged in and my son refused it as well. The ingredients are worth 5 stars and I hope the company can package it differenty (if that indeed is the reason) because it is quite pricey for such an issue and not worth it if my infant won't drink it.
0;"""I told my wife to buy Bob's Candy Canes when she went off to the store last night. Since they did not have them she bought these instead.<br /><br />I decided since they were here I would go ahead and try one.<br /><br />They were not very good.<br />How they were not  very good  is hard to describe.<br />They just tasted like cheap candy<br /><br />For the first time in my life I told my wife to take them back to the Grocery Store. I had never done that before- ordinarily we would throw lousy food away instead of returning it. But this candy was simply awful.<br /><br />My wife examined the package and saw   Made in Mexico  on the back in very small letters.<br /><br />No wonder.<br /><br />It seems we no longer make our own candy in this country either."""
0;"""I bought this product because I was looking for something more natural for my sensitive skin.  Says its  gentle for all skin types  but it's not.  Literally 2 seconds after I put the first dab on my face it started burning. I could see my skin turning red and getting a rash under it.  I had to wash it off immediately.  The spot that had it does feel softer than the rest of my face"
0;"""If you are looking for oatmeal cookies do not buy these as they have the same texture and flavor as Keebler's other cookies. I purchased these in hopes of having delicious oatmeal texture and flavor however what I received by what I could see was a standard keebler cookie with oats on top. Now I know some of you might be thinking"
0;"""I drink a lot of iced tea but not if it isn't sweet.  I thought these individual packets would be good for adding to my tea and I'm glad to have something that won't spike my insulin levels.  One packet is worth about two sugar packets so be careful how much you use.  I think sugar tastes good"
0;I have a three year old lasspoo I have given him sweet potato treats before and he loved them. I have heard and read so many great things about sams yams that when I saw them on amazon I got 4 bags super excited. When I got them I opened them up and gave one to my very excited dog he loved it. But as my doggie is small only 18 lbs I decided to cut them in half so I emptied the treats on my kitchen table to find TWO LIVE MAGGOTS! I was so grossed out I quickly took the treat away from my doggie and opened another bag and the same thing MORE MAGGOTS! I'm so disappointed please do not buy this product! I have pictures !<br /><br />I called the company and left a message since it was after hours I never heard back. Needless to say I returned them to amazon. I wish I could leave a picture on this review to show u all!

0;"""I grew up eating Starkist tuna.  It was my favorite above any other brands I tried.  This is not the same tuna it was before.<br /><br />I noticed a decline in quality for some time.  The tuna had a stronger smell.  There was often nuclear-orange glowing color on top of the tuna.  The size of the cans got smaller.  One can used to yield a few sandwiches.  Now you have to open at least two cans for two people.  When you drain the liquid out"
0;"""Just bought a bag of this and it smelled so bad it left a bad smell in the garage just during the time the sealed dog food container was opened to scoop out the food.  I don't have a good feeling about this horrific smell"
0;"""I don't know about the rest of the reviewers (or their dogs) but my dog is reluctant to eat this stuff.  He's a shelter dog that has known hard times and will eat almost anything (and loves Before Grain foods"
0;Through email my vet advised me about a product recall on this food. Before I got the email I fed my dog this food and she became sick. I have had my dog on this food for 6 months but the last bag made her sick right away. I was told the distributor (Diamond) will be sending refunds. Here is the website to check the for the specific bags that were recalled. [...]
0;"""My dog loved this the first few meals then was not interested.  I liked the ingredient list.  Now I have found out that this brand has been recalled. I have disposed of what I had left.  Unfortunately I did not keep the bag but will for now on.  Watch out.<br /><br />May 4"
0;I have been feeding my dog TOTW for a couple years now. The last bag I purchased was 2 weeks ago and my dog started throwing up the day after feeding her.  Her poop was 90% runny and was blood red color.  I did my research online and the production code on the bag was one of the recalled.  I called Amazon and they immediately stopped selling the item.<br /><br />I am in disbelief that this has happened!
0;This formula caused my baby to be very constipated. He's also not slept well since being on it (tummy ache?). I'm switching to Earth's best.<br />Also it doesn't fully mix or dissolve in the water. It appears grainy. I've also read bad things about the fact that it contains cane sugar (which can supposedly contribute to diabetes in later life and tooth decay now).
0;Don't buy this product.  I read the reviews that said the product was stale and they all appeared to be old reviews. The problem appeared to be fixed in the most recent reviews and I didn't believe they could sell a bad product for an extended period on Amazon and get away with it. I was wrong.  The couscous tastes rancid - if it's not stale it certainly is not appetizing.
0;It took a while to understand why none of the Starbucks stores could make a good glass anymore until I realized they changed the recipe. Now the mail order bags have also been changed and it is no longer that great Tazo tea anymore. So disappointed.
0;"""The Organo Gold  Organic  Green Tea seems to be promoting a rather deceiving platform.

0;"""BRM 'gluten free' items still contain some sort of gluten cross contamination.  We started SCD/GAPS to deal with lingering health problems caused by eating a regular GF diet for our Celiacs.  I bought 2 different brands of almond flour"
0;This is the worst tasting stuff I've ever experienced in a T-Disc.  It literally tastes like coffee flavored medicine.  It even leaves a bad medicine like  aftertaste in your mouth.  Very disappointed.  Won't ever buy again nor can I recommend it.

WHATEVER RESTAURANT SERVES THIS TEA THE FOOD MUST BE JUST AS BAD!!NOW I can't return it - DO NOT BUY THIS TEA."""
0;I was extremely disappointed by this product because the expiration date is 2 month away when I received the product. And it could not be returned! Is there any way to find out the expiration date before I purchase it?
0;to get this to taste anywhere even close to what milk tastes like requires 5 tablespoons per cup.  that means this powder milk costs close to $7 a gallon of milk.  and it does not taste like milk.  what's worse is it is a complete nightmare to prepare.  the powder is liquidy fine and goes everywhere and sticks to everything.
0;these pods are too thick.  i can't put two in my senseo machine.  i can put one of these pods and one of the senseo-branded pods.<br /><br />i called wolfgang puck's support number and they said they knew about the problem and do contact amazon about returning them.<br /><br />big drag.
0;Was searching under K-Cup Category for some Columbian Coffee.  Finally thought i found it only to find out that these were Pods not K-Cups.  Now I have a couple of cases that i amazon refuses to take a return on because they had messed up the categorization on these.

0;I was curious and tried this item on Jan 28th.  I bought 2 bottles of the lemon-lime.  The taste is very bad---need to flush it down with a glass of water.  Within about 30 minutes I began feeling very uneasy---sort of had the jitters----didn't have a lot of energy but was very nervous and just could not sit down.  I was afraid it was effecting my heart rate or blood pressure but I checked and both those remained normal even though I felt very uneasy.<br />I tried it a day later with the second bottle---same results.  Very uncomfortable feeling---I will not use it anymore

Then the commercial for 5-hour energy popped in my head"
0;I am pretty sensitive to caffeine so I was a bit nervous about taking this stuff. If I drink coffee or tea on an empty stomach I tend to get the heebie-jeebies. I drank a full bottle and didn't really feel anything. Nothing good and nothing bad. I took the berry flavor and it wasn't that bad at all. I think I'll stick to some strong Irish tea.

0;"""I honestly don't get the popularity of this item. It is nothing more than B complex in liquid form. I guess it's something to take if you don't carry around a small bottle of B vitamins. Maybe I drink too much coffee and that is why I can't appreciate the energy effects of a B complex"

0;I'm probably on the 10th bag I've bought right here on amazon...however the reason for the 1 star doesn't reflect the quality of the treats but the pricing. I went to Costco the other day and they were being sold for less than $11. That being said I'll be stocking up from Costco and hope theyll always be sold there.
0;"""I am unsure why this product caused such problems for my dogs as the ingredients look okay and it says  highly digestible .  I guess I need to look for  fully digestible .  I didn't throw them out because I want to write the company and my husband decided to give a treat to one of the dogs"
0;"""My 7 year old took one bite of this product and then pushed the rest of the box to me and said I could have it. I was greatly surprised by this because chocolate and marshmellows are her 2 of her favorite ingredients. After taking a bite of the product myself"
0;This product arrived in a condition that was not acceptable.  The chocolate was discolored and the cookies were broken apart.  They look so unappetizing that I did not want to eat them and therefore didn't.  I wondered if they were stored in a warehouse that was not climate controlled.
0;I love the Sylvia's greens and when I ordered a case I decided to also order the squash which I had not tried. I thought the squash and onions would be as good.  I have been very disappointed and have not touched a second can.  Love the greens!!!!
0;"""Need I say more.  The only problem with them is stopping.  You too?<br /><br />They were my morning treat in the service.  A truck rolled up around 10 and my standard was the 6 Lorna Doone sleeve and the large coffee.  25-cents BTW<br /><br />FIVE STAR DOWN TO ONE!!!!<br />Added 3/12: Well"
0;Maybe it's just me but I thought this really tasted like crap. Funky aftertaste and just not good tasting in general. Maybe it tastes better when your hungry and freezing while camping up in the mountains but in my kitchen it was no good.

0;How this tea could get any stars is beyond me.  I tried one bag and could not taste anything...you got it nothing.  So next I used two bags in a cup to see if that improved the taste...still no taste.  At my age I will not waste time on useless things so I gave the rest of my order to a friend who also enjoys Earl Grey Tea without my comment.  The next day she asked if I wanted my tea back saying it was the worse tea ever!!!<br />I will bet they do not publish this review but hope they will.<br />Do not buy this tea.

0;"""$12.99 for ONE 10oz bag of peanut butter chips? That price is insane. There is absolutely no way I would pay that. ROBBERY. You can get it for around $2.50 in any grocery store. A similar incident happened with the Hershey's Cinnamon chips. They were hiked up in price the last few weeks from $15.43 for 6 10oz bags to $27.95. I called Amazon out on this in a review and then the price suddenly dropped back to where it was. Well now I'm calling them out on this. Price gouging isn't cool Amazon. Not at all. Once again"
0;I have received these as gifts. The originals that come from Turkey do not come sopped in sugar.<br />They are placed in a tray that resembles an ice tray. This product came wrapped in paper and tasted nothing like the ones I have had in the past. I unfortunately bought a 4 pack and had to give the other 3 packs away. They did not taste good at all.
0;"""Tastes like granola.<br /><br />That's pretty much all I could say in a positive review. Now let me get to the negatives:<br /><br />1) The granola has an almost stale characteristic to it. I don't think I'd call it rock-hard"

0;I would never buy this product again.  The hulls equal the amount of popcorn. It would be much better without all of the extraneous stuff.  This product should probably come with a bonus pack of dental floss or maybe a discounted coupon for a water pick.
0;I can't believe this is getting some good reviews. This stuff is horrible. It is the worst tasting sugar substitute I have ever tasted. It has a terrible aftertaste. I wouldn't was my money on it again. GROSS

0;"""I have been looking for pumpkin spice coffee that really has a good flavor to it and bought this because of the reviews.  I opened the bag and was surprised to find no smell that hinted the presence of anything other than normal coffee. I made a pot of coffee and still"
0;"""BAD smell when I opened the bag and even worse smell when brewing the stuff.  Not sure what the flavor is..some bad spice or chemical taste..family did not like it nor did our friends... all turned up noses..wish I  could return but...green mountain has an awesome pumpkin coffee"
0;This product may be exactly what is described but I don't like the taste. For me it has too much clove taste and is almost medicinal in its strength. After steeping three minutes I couldn't finish the cup. With a two minute steep I could tolerate it but I know I won't finish all the boxes. I wish I could have found it at my local store to try first before buying so much.<br />I like Chai flavored creamers so I should have just ordered plain white tea and added that. The positive ratings made it sound good but for me the spice flavor is overpowering (like euclayptus menthol).
0;This jelly is absolutely impossible to spread.  It takes 4-5 packs just for 1 slice of bread and it is globby because you can't spread it.  I won't be buying this ever again and hopefully you won't either.

Ha.  Try calling the corporate office and speaking to a live person. Ha.  It ain't gonna happen. After 3 weeks of periodic calling and only getting voice mail on both lines"
0;"""I'm sorry to say that I just did not enjoy these mozzarella cheese Cheez-It's. I like actual mozzarella cheese but the flavor powder on these crackers was just way too much for me.

A couple other people tried the crackers and weren't too impressed either.<br /><br />I like regular cheddar Cheez-It's"

0;I love illy coffee. I think it is among the finest in the world. I even enjoy illy iced coffee in the can--but not this version. It tasted like bland epresso mixed with nonsparkling seltzer. Only 50 calories but I wIsh they added more calories if it meant this would be tastier. Not sweet at all. Sorry illy. It is a miss.
0;I took three swallows and could not drink anymore to me it tasted like motor oil!  And the aftertaste was the worst!  I brushed my teeth three times and could still not get the stench out!  Skip at all costs!
0;I had high hopes for this drink despite the fact that I prefer unsweetened drinks.  I poured it in the glass and was unhappy with how dark it was.  I took a sip and choked.  This drink is bitter and to me undrinkable.  It was like drinking the bottom of a burned pot of coffee.  I tried adding milk to the cup but it didn't lighten the color at all.  Even with the milk I couldn't drink it and down the drain it went.  Awful!

0;You can buy this EXACT SAME kit at Target for $8.99 (regular price 12.99) and save yourself the outrageous price and ridiculous shipping costs.  Normally I like the goldbox deals but this is highway robbery Amazon!
0;This is the worst product.  Not a product to put together with kids.  The problem with the product is they don't use royal icing.  Their icing is the worst.  It may be reasonably priced but put the coffee on and find that it falls apart and the family has a nice treat.  If you want it to work make a batch of royal icing.  Wilton's is $2.00 more and worth it.

0;Undrinkable after two minutes - the ginger makes it taste like pepper-tea. The powder is so finely ground that there is no way to filter it out once it's mixed with water or milk. Quite a disappointment.
0;Not only is the canister only 1/3 full but this tastes so horrible. My very un-fussy 4 year old literally spat it out. Thinking maybe she was being fussy I tried it myself and the sickly sweet taste is just vile. I use Vitality Supergreens and Dr Schultz's for myself and hoped to find a product that would be just as beneficial but tasty enough for a child - well this is definitely not it. Massive waste of money.
0;"""I received these chips yesterday and they are horrible. They are very stale-tasting and also very oily. The date printed on the bags is Sep 9th and therefore this is the way that they are supposed to taste BEFORE they are expired"
0;The chips are so-so.  For me a package when opened must pass the smell test - these didn't.  When ordering a case (12 bags) I assumed they would be shipped in a factory packed box.  Not so.  They were repackaged by Amazon in a box designed for ten bags.  The case consisted of 12 bags.  No problem for the packer as he just squeezed in the two extra bags.  You can imagine what that does to potato chips.  I now have 6 bags of whole chips and 6 bags of chip pieces which can be eaten with a spoon.

0;I was so immensly disappointed.  I was hoping to get the same tea that they serve in the chinese restaurants and kept being told that it was oolong tea.  I finally found it on Amazon and to my disappointment it did NOT taste the same!  Actually it was a bit bitter and now I have all of this tea I know it will take me forever to drink because of the flavor..  Was not happy..  :(
0;"""Thought these would be like a brownie with crunchy nuts but I was wrong! These don't taste like chocolate but like bitter cocoa powder instead. Mine had tiny pieces of nuts unlike their other bars that have bigger nut pieces. My husbands had medium nut pieces. We both are vegan and consume only organic foods so we know what to  expect  but these are awful. They're not even a little bit good"
0;I drink tea my entire life. Decided to try something different. Bad choice! This tea tastes awful to me. I do not like any cinnamon or any other spices in my tea. The Amazon description should include the list of ingredients for each product!
0;I bought this tea because I like Timothy's Coffee products and figured the tea would be just as good.  I could't have been more wrong.  It has barely any flavor and what you do taste is horrible. I am so sorry I bought the 48 pk.
0;I love mango anything except for this. They have a really oily taste.  Yuck. I was quite disappointed. I wish they came by the pack instead of a whole case so I wouldn't have wasted so much money trying them out.

0;"""Emerald Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews were quite a disappointment.  The cashews are rather small and a bit broken up (which could have been from the shipping) although they seem to be of good quality.  The problem with this product"
0;This product contains genetically modified cottonseed oil. There is no excuse for a premium nut company to be using GMO oils in its products. I'm finding it more and more difficult to find nuts that don't have GMO oils. And now Emerald has sold out too!
0;This doesn't taste good at all! It actually made me sick. The salt content is astronomonical. It is so salty it's unbelievable.  Nice try for an instant gluten free product but it doesn't make the mark!

Not only do I feel cheated from not receiving what I ordered and paid for"
0;Wow. This has been my favorite creamer for about three years now. I drink 5-6 cups of coffee a morning and may have a few during the day. A 'serving' of this is about two tablespoons for my coffee. I like it white and sweet!<br /><br />So what I've just learned it that I've basically been injesting a lethal dosage of trans fat every single day.<br />1 gram of transfat for every cup of coffee I drink. I had no idea.<br /><br />WAY TO GO FDA!! Wonder what they got paid to make this minor exclusion.<br />Thanks Nestle for expoiting the system. Should be attempted murder.
0;The price online was a little high and they had very little liquor inside the chocolates. I eventually found some Liquor filled Chocolates at a local liquor store. It was a 1/3 of the price and contained much more liquor then the ones I got on amazon. I will never order a product from JollyCandy again.
0;This sauce was no where near as hot as it claims. Tried this sauce along with Dave's ultimate insanity sauce and Dave's was way hotter then this huge let down. Was very disappointed with the low quality of heat it didn't have.

0;I have been hooked on pumpkin lattes from Dunkin and Starbucks.  I have an espresso machine and have been trying to find syrups that taste even remotely like the two chains.  Monin was the worst. Very strange after-taste.  Horrible in one word.  This one is pretty bad.  Where is the pumpkin taste?!! I'm on a mission!!
0;I'm a huge fan of the pumpkin flavoring Dunkin Donuts uses and I was hoping this would come close. No such luck. This stuff smells like Southern Comfort and is sickeningly sweet. Not much of a pumpkin flavor and no hint of spices at all. I ended up dumping the stuff down the drain.
0;I ordered peeled plum tomatoes and received a 12 pack of diced tomatoes instead.  Every can has a dent in it which isn't as big of a deal compared to not receiving what I ordered.  It would have been nice to have had the option of waiting on additional plum tomatoes (if they were out of stock) vs. them sending me an alternate product.  Not too happy about this...
0;Believe it when you read all the reviews that say these smell fishy and have an odd texture ....<br />It is true that the noodles take on the taste of the other ingredients that they are mixed with but it does not take away from the odd texture
0;"""If I could give less than 1 star I would. These vile  noodles  are disgusting in every way. If you can get these vile things down and keep them down then you should be on tv with Andrew Zimmern on Bizarre Foods."""
0;These are terrible.  I eat a lot of diet items and have never come across something so gross.  The texture is just weird and has no flavor. It does not take the flavor of what you are cooking.  I had one package and threw the rest away. Don't waste your money people.
0;OMG! This product is Soooo healthy BUT...It probably isn't so healthy if U can't stomach them! These noodles are just short of Gross! And to some they will indeed be way beyond Gross! I can eat just about ANYTHING...but these noodles surely slowed me down! They are like clear jello noodles...no taste except a little fishy...but the consistency is...well...GROSS! They are hard to disguise but I am trying! I cover them with a very tasty vodka spaghetti sauce...this is the only way that I have been able to eat them so far. If U purchase these...good luck! U'r gonna need it! The soy version of the shirataki noodles are much more palatable! And almost as healthy so I will stick with them!
0;I really was excited to learn from Dr. Oz about these Shirataki noodles since I am a diabetic who just happens to adore pasta.  Sorry Dr. Oz but this is absolutely NOT a good substitute for Pasta or anything that I would consider edible.  May as well eat rubber bands with some sort of sauce on them.  I would not recommend this to even my most hated enemy.  I believe I have said enough!

The texture is horrible and the smell (even after rinsed and par boiled) is just as bad.  I eat all kinds of foods (ethnic"
0;Been a while since I did any fishing but the texture of the night crawlers I use to catch and use for bait is something you don't forget and that's exactly what these noodles felt like in my mouth.<br /><br />Was impressed with the no calorie factor but can't get past the texture so I threw them out!
0;This seems like a great idea.  I have read other reviews that say the noodles take on the flavor of what you mix them with and the texture is close to that of regular pasta...this is not true.  These taste like something I already ate.  They made me sick just trying to eat them.  I had to eat something else just to keep this food down.  Do not buy.  Not worth the slimy texture.  Get low carb noodles and exercise a little.  What a waste of money.
0;I should have known when the product told me to rinse it for several minutes to get rid of the putrid smell - smells like they shipped dead fish heads to me. These are awful and I can't imagine anyone liking this crap. The taste is just as bad too.
0;"""I feel for all the hype on these noodles.  I bought the six pack of the angel hair noodles.  I followed directions on the package and then served them in my stir fry as my noodles.  They smell like fish"
0;"""I wish I knew that the noodles were already cooked. I think it was already cooked...it was soft.  The noodles came in a liquid and smelled like fish.  I soaked it in seasoning and olive oil overnight to get rid of the smell...it did.  I cooked it again and mixed with a white sauce.  I am very picky about food textures"

The box arrived today and I haven't opened it up yet and plan on returning it for fraudulent advertising. If it doesn't bother you to purchase from VIET NAM"
0;I ordered a box of these and I think I got a bad batch.  They taste horrible and I have tried all 3 size settings on my brewer.  There isn't even the slightest hint of chocolate flavor.  I have cconsumed over 30 different varities of KCups and this is by far the worst one yet.  It is completely undrinkable.
0;"""This has been my least favorite coffee purchase so far for the Keurig. My husband came into the kitchen and thought I had been conducting a science experiment as it smelled like chemicals.

0;"""This is the absolute worst flavored coffee I ever put in my mouth.  I took several sips to be sure I hated it.  On the fourth sip I had to spew it back into the cup.

0;I don't know who does the taste testing for this company but none of their flavor coffee tastes anything like what they advertise. This product does not taste anything like a chocolate glaze donut. Taste more like bug spray.<br />Stay away
0;"""I purchased this coffee with high anticipation after I heard it being raved about by the morning radio DJ's.  I was disappointed when I received and tried it for myself.  It doesn't really taste like a chocolate doughnut"

I can only recommend this coffee to extreme loners or people who are looking for an unforgettable and indisputable way to say to their significant other that maybe this just wasn't meant to be.

0;This has been my favorite brand of pitted dates for some time now. The last batch however had an actual living moth that flew out of the container when I opened it and at least half the dates were infected with maggots. The smaller batch containers I get at the supermarket are fine.
0;Bought this because it's advertized as good as a coffee creamer too.  I found the taste pretty bad for use in coffee.  Avoid! Get the stuff that actually says coffee creamer on the box itself. I'm giving one star because of poor advertising. Maybe this works okay as a substitute for other cream uses. Not sure yet.
0;I ordered this product because my puppy had a similar treat before and really liked it. I ordered these and gave him one treat. His stomach got really upset and he threw up and had bad potties. If your puppy has a sensitive stomach I might try something different.
0;Please do some research yourself to find out that they are ALWAYS rated the worst food for your pet in unbiased reviews.<br /><br />The top ingredients for this product are crude meal and loads of grains.. Grains = bad for pets and are cheap for companys like iams to use.

0;This jerky is pretty gross.  It tastes more sausage-y like a slim-jim.  Both the picture and the nutrition facts on the web site say it has 21 grams of protein.  The package I got looks the same except that it's actually 16g of protein and 14g of fat!  This shouldn't be called jerky.

0;I love many flavors of Larabars and like how they are raw and simple.  I bought one of this flavor to see if I wanted a box...no way.  You get the coconut that hits your taste buds first...then you are instantly smacked with an aftertaste of *SOAP*!  Terrible.  I tried 3 bites to see if it got better...NO.  I'd never recommend this although I do like other flavors.
0;"""My daughter is extremely sensitive to gluten so many products that promote themselves as gluten free prove to be otherwise when my daughter has a gluten reaction.  For the sake of keeping my daughter healthy I contact companies asking them if they test for gluten and if gluten is processed in the same facility.  If it is then it is almost certainly contaminated.  Most companies give me a detailed and open answer so that I can make the best decision for my daughter.  They don't assume they know if the product is okay for my daughter or not.  They give me the facts and the numbers and let me make my own decision.  Larabar did NOT give me a clear answer.  They gave me a very vague answer assuring me that they went through stringent testing but they did not say what kind of testing.  They also said their products met the FDA requirements for gluten free which is so BOGUS b/c the FDA currently does not have any sort of requirements or enforcements for gluten free labels.  They are proposing implementing one but have not yet done so.  So Larabar is attempting to deceive me.  They also did not answer my question if gluten was also processed in the facilities that process Larabars.  Again"

0;This is the worst product that I've ever had.  It is spiky and bony.  I am surprise no one has yet choke on it.  I would never buy this again.  The more expensive Spanish imports taste much better than this without the spiky bones.
0;I bought this Shilajit thinking it was such a great deal-- wow over 2 pounds for less than 50 dollars!<br />Well we have bought Shilajit before and this is not the real deal!  Its so bad- it tastes actually rancid-- It dosn't act  or taste like real Shilajit either-- real shilajit bunches up together -its first comes in a rock form- and if you grind up that rock it will be a powder- but it will come back together in a solid mass form once again after it has been powdered-- even if you buy capsules of it -if you open the caps you will find it has become solid- this so-called Shilajit is like rancid old flour- with some very bitter thing  added-- IT gave my son a headache!  When I asked them for a refund he flat out refused - bogus product -bogus company!
0;Ordered 3 boxes of the Twisted Ring Pops because we can't find the Twisted Ring Pops anywhere and what we received were the regular Ring Pops that you can buy anywhere. Very disappointed and Returning the product. Buyer BEWARE!
0;This stuff comes in tins that are about the size of a 50 cent piece.  It's a big production to make any dip from it and I really don't think there's enough contents for that.  I ended up making a salad dressing (made just enough for one salad) by adding balsamic vinegar and olive oil and some grainy mustard.  It was pretty tasty.  Save your money though.....this isn't worth it.
0;I usually drink Brooke Bond Taj Mahal and I decided to try it since it was on sale at the local Indian grocery store. My mistake. It has an oily smell and the taste is flat. Never buying this again. I drank about 20 bags and then couldn't take anymore. Tossed the lot.
0;"""I don't understand all these reviews. I have tried two different batches of these cookies and they have a horrible aftertaste.  My five year old son says he wants me to put in the review that these cookies make  super horrible cookies and dough . I bake all the time and have made many gluten free desserts.  I like the Bob's Red Mill brownies but these cookies have a horrible aftertaste that does not go away after they are cooked as one reviewer stated. In fact"
0;"""I have been reading about the benefits of a gluten free diet recently and saw the Bob's cookie mix on the shelf and gave it a try...As usual I ate a little dough in the mixing process and the taste had me pessimistic .. but what the hay .. let's try it.. Well...They were dry and cooked up very strangely but were cookie-like nonetheless.  So down the hatch and the taste and consistency was AWFUL !.. Lesson.. !! If you want to be healthy"
0;"""I bought a sampler from this company primarily to sample their fudge. After 3 weeks and 4-5 calls and emails I finally received my order. They would have been better not to send it at all. I received some stale mini cones that taste like cardboard"
0;Expiration on packaging says 10/02/12 and today is 08/09/12 so I called Amazon and they refund the purchase because they can't reship because this is a common problem with this product.<br />I have to say I don't think the exp. date was anything but deliberate on the companies part.

0;This new honey pineapple mango is awful.  The worst tasting powdered tea mix I have ever had.  I guess I will have to go back to plain iced tea because I threw this stuff out.  I loved the Green Tea TO GO mandarin and mango but it has been discontinued by Lipton and replaced with this terrible tasting stuff.  I won't even waste my money trying the other new flavors.
0;"""I can't write a review of this product because I cannot use it.<br /><br />I got it thinking it was a natural alternative to the mixes with aspartame or high fructose corn syrup...but no.

0;So i tried this one day and was naseuous after drinking one serving mixed with water.<br /><br />Maybe it was funky artificial mango pineapple taste? Or the artificial sweeteners in it? Either way it was pretty nasty.. I wouldnt drink this again nor offer to anyone.
0;I was trying all of the honey tea flavors that came out and I am not a fan of this one. The other two I tried were actually fairly good but this one had an awful flavor to it. Doesn't even remotely taste like what strawberry anything would taste like. I would buy a different flavor.
0;The description doesn't say how many cups are included - so it's impossible for me to determine whether this is a good buy or not.  It's not like Amazon to skimp on descriptions.... anyone know the total number of Kcups in this tea offer?
0;this product came to me and was out of date so i couldnt even use it furthermore i complained about and was told i would be given new product but have not received it as of yet.  great customer service huh?

0;"""This sad confection is a perfect example of why you shouldn't do your grocery shopping while you're hungry. It was a total impulse buy and i was REALLY excited about it. No eggs? No dairy? Hooray a cookie for vegans like me! It sounded perfect. When i got home and took a bite i was SO disappointed. There's hardly any lemon flavor to it and it sucked all the moisture out of my mouth. It was like trying to swallow paste. I tried a few more bites to give it a fair chance ... but wound up throwing the majority of the cookie in the trash.<br /><br />Unfortunately"
0;Are you kidding me???  The 90 positive reviews must be the owners relatives.  This is the worst gluten free product I have ever eaten. It is dry and it is mealy.  The only way it was marginally tolerable was to smother it in chocolate icing.  My wife told me to complain to the company and I told her I didn't want them sending me any free product.
0;"""These cones show up on a search for gluten free groceries but they are obviously NOT gluten free (wheat flour is the first ingredient).  Amazon will not change the category of items like this but ALWAYS read the ingredient label carefully"
0;WARNING... you will only get one package from this company.  It labels it as 16 count.  You will only get one tiny pouch.  2.99 for 16 is a wonderful bargain!  For 1 pouch you might as well give your baby veal.  This isn't the only product from them I ordered and they were all misleading!I will never buy from 911 again!!<br />I gave it one start because I couldn't give it NO STARS
0;"""I purchased this product from WFM and am quickly deleting it off of my wishlist. I cooked following the directions exactly. The texture is that of a rubber band. The taste is completely indescribable. We eat lots of  different  and alternative foods"
0;"""They came to me as if they had melted in the bag at some time and got returned by a customer. The bag had 1/2 the pink coating of the M&M's adhered to the bag. And it was winter than they were delivered. Some of the M&M's were broken"
0;the only reason i gave salad cream 1 star is because of the price. i love miracle whip and this tastes exactly like kraft miracle whip. if you look at the label on miracle whip it is also called a dressing which i promise you heinz salad cream tastes just like miracle whip. so save yourself at least half the money that this product costs and just buy miracle whip.
0;"""I decided to try multiple Hormel products when the sale made their price reasonable but I found many of the products to be just HORRIBLE!  This particular Chicken and Noodle is a bowl of salt with hard"
0;We've tried these bars several times in a few different flavors and they are always cross contaminated with dairy.  I think the chocolate actually contains milk so that may be the source of the problem. My kid's allergic so it's pretty easy to tell when a new food is causing a problem.<br /><br />They're delicious and the times we've tried them they are never stale or too hard to chew (like the other natural crispy rice bar that is actually dairy free).  Wish they didn't have a cross contamination problem.

Your credit card was not charged for this order. If you're still interested in this item"
0;I ordered these bars and was sent info from vitaminshoppe that they were backordered and would be sent out later than originally posted.  I later received an email from Amazon that my order was cancelled yet the item shows it in stock.  I believe that the item was posted at a too low price and Amazon or Vitamin shoppe couldn't keep up with the volume of orders.  Very disappointed.
0;I don't know what is in them but it paralyzed my tongue! The bitter aftertaste lasted all day and I had to lay down because of nausea. They were awful. I checked the expiration date on the package and they were still considered fresh until next year.  I have no idea what was wrong with them but you can bet I'll never try another package. Horrible awful stuff. Just horrid! Had to give it one star to rate this product but it doesn't deserve even one.
0;"""I was very disappointed with this purchase! The k-cups came in a plain box with the cups dumped in.  Most looked smashed or old. There is no expiration date so there is no way to tell how old these things are. They look old!!  Also"
0;Everything in this basket was cheap and not worth the price.  There was even a sticker from oriental trading company on one of the items in the basket. Do not waste your money.  I buy lots of things from Amazon and have always been happy.  I have never written a review before - - but this one was sooooooo bad!
0;we did not like these at all. my kids refuse to eat them and so i try to pass them off to neighbors and they havent really liked them either. things we did find that are a healthier and still tasty option are clif kids twisted roped and fruitaBu (any flavor).
0;I am having to throw this piece of junk out after having it for just over a year because they won't service it because the warranty is up and there is nobody in my area who can. This is the second time it breaks. The first time they fixed it and made me pay the shipping charges... which ended up to be expensive because I had to buy a box and all the packaging materials too! But now it broke and there is nothing they will do! Terrible product and even worse customer service!
0;"""We have just returned our Saeco after having it one day!  We called the Saeco number for advise on why coffee will not brew...they were helpful but now have returned the machine to them rather than Amazon.  Hopefully"
0;I purchased a Saeco Coffee grinder/maker the end of Sept 2011. It is now running continous w/o being able to turn off the grinder -- I called and found out that Saeco was bought by Phillips and they are NOT honoring warrantees on Saeco product but if I go through lots of hoops they MAY issue a refund in 3-4 weeks if they can process my order?????
0;Wow! I've been buying dog treats for over 40 years and this one takes the cake! Pay no attention to the photo in the advertisement for this product. What you get is two (2) small chews in each of three (3) shrink wrapped over cardboard packages. That's a total of six (6) small chews for $30.00 not including shipping! I couldn't return my order quick enough.
0;"""This is for one (1) yes 1 bottle of this nice product. I am very familiar with this product and knew I would like the actual product. When I reviewed possible sellers and saw this price I thought this must be for a case of the product based on the price. When I was unable to find any quantity in the description"
0;Buy Sadaf Green Lentils<br />Steer clear of Red Lentils except when you want to exhale through your butt. When cooking these become gooey easily and needs less time than green lentils but if you eat more than a little it will cause you lot of gas and flatulence. I will never buy it again. Green lentils rock my world.

0;I was very diappointed in this product. It was NASTY and I didn't like the Pina Colada either. I would like to return the rest of the product for a refund. The Wine Freezer was delicious! I will buy this item again.
0;These were supposed to be individual chocolate covered blueberries.  What I received was a solid block of chocolate blueberries.  The chocolate had melted and reformed into a solid mess.  Inedible.  Very disappointing.  I have ordered chocolate products from other vendors with no melting issues.
0;"""I have been giving Wellness to my 7 month old pitbull since he was 8 weeks old. I chose it because it is supposed to be a good and natural food. It's very expensive and I thought I was giving my puppy the best. Wrong.<br />My pup has had bad gas all this time but I did not think it was due to the dog food. We just thought he was eating too fast. Then when he was 4 months"
0;I paid for a beautiful gift like the picture but i got an article that looked used! The white paint was yellowish. It's a old box with oxidized and broken lock. I throw away the cookies because don't have expiration date.
0;"""I really liked how my hair looked at first when I tried this shampoo but by day 3 and 4 I started developing itchy bumps on my scalp. I also realized that this product was leaving a film on my hair. I had been using sulfate free shampoos for the last few years but I broke down and bought this because of all the great reviews. This shampoo is not for everyone. If you're at all sensitive to chemicals"
0;"""Aspertame causes alot of problems including preventing weight loss<br />It gives me a headache and causes my Mom's blood pressure to go up<br />I would rather get it with out any sweetner added or have honey in it.<br /><br />The FDA knows it's poison and denies it.<br /><br />I don't like to see people being hurt by the lies concerning what they eat and drink.<br /><br />We should get in the habit of researching all ingredients in what we eat the less ingredients the better.<br />I hope this helps someone"
0;"""To help me drink more water I used flavor crystals to make it more palatable. When I visited my doctor I was told I had high blood pressure. I asked why for 66 years my blood pressure was normal but now it was high and I needed 2 prescriptions. Doctor said that was normal. Since I like to research I found that the crystals I was using had Aspartame"
0;I ordered this last week.  It arrived in a box with no padding or packaging material.  The bag was torn and half the yeast was spilled into the shipping box and had to be discarded.<br /><br />I'm terribly disappointed in the manner in which Amazon shipped the yeast.<br /><br />I attempted to use some of the yeast in a bread recipe and it failed to rise.  I think it was not only in a damaged container but also dead.  What a waste of money.
0;I was looking forward for some crushed pepper for pizza and pasta dishes boy was I super disappointed had a smokey flavor with no heat.I ended up buying a food dehydrator and some habeneros so much more heat and flavor....Don't waste you time or money I wish I could get a  refund!!!
0;The first split second after popping one of these in to my mouth wasn't so bad. Then reality set in. The taste that overcame my mouth was honestly the worst I think I've ever experienced. I can't even describe it. I immediately spit it out and promptly tossed the two packages I bought. Yuk!
0;"""I COULD rate this item but  Mild  wasn't what I received.  The sealed box that said  Mild  on the outside actually contained  Wild  packets.  What a disappointment.  I was able to sell the item to a friend who liked it.  Order with caution."""
0;I just purchased these beets and couldn't wait to get them home and try them.  They are the worst beets I have ever had.  I love pickled beets and have been eating them for years.  These tatse like a musty basement smells.  I'll stick with Greenwood Beets or Joycie's Beets both are delicious.
0;I should have checked before ordering my bad. This item can be bought locally for less than $5.00 for two 48 oz. bottles. As seen in the other reviews of this product. It is being returned for a refund. Amazon fulfilled  from third party vendor.
0;The real question is if the health benefits of green tea outway the side effects of using artifical sweeteners.  Yes his product contains aspartame.  That's enough for me to never use this line of products.
0;"""Note the Disclaimer: product may be different than pictured.  Pa. Dutch Gen'l Store doesn't know Barbados Molasses from old motor oil - and the label on the jar doesn't state what is in it. This goop is no different from Brer Rabbit sorghum (syrup) that you can buy in your local grocery store"
0;long ago I got NV's peanut crunch at Costco and loved it. but they stopped carrying it and I couldn't find it anywhere locally. I was excited when I saw Amazon had the almond crunch. price was good with the subscribe and save plus an additional discount. product arrived very quickly--couple days before estimated delivery date. excitedly took a bite and was quite disappointed. bar was very hard and somewhat stale. canceled my subscription immediately. site won't let me give NO stars.
0;Not good at all. Didnt like the candies. And you cant even return them. Total waste of money. Candies are so hard that you cant even get the taste of liquor. The liquor filled chocolates from Anthony Berg is way much better.
0;I love this soup and it is somewhat hard to find in stores. This is why I bought it on Amazon. However the order arrived with half of the cans dented (a couple of them really bad). This should not happen and it is a health issue. I would not buy them in this condition at the supermarket. Amazon should have inspected them before sending them.
0;"""I *cheer* the fact these pickle relish packages contain turmeric spice which is a super powerful anti-inflammatory (strong enough that my husband used turmeric capsules over pain meds when he had surgery for a hip fracture a couple years ago..)<br /><br />However... these pickle relish packets contain BLUE 1!  FD&C BLUE 1 causes severe abdominal distress in a percentage of the population (many of whom have yet to make the connection).  If you aren't sure why Blue 1 is such a bad idea"
0;The product description is incomplete. It also contain High Fructose Corn Syrup. I threw it in the trash. They got my money ... once with their deceptive advertising. They will not get it again. Shame is there isn't a zero star rating
0;I purchased these Pepperidge Farm cookies for a family member that is sick in the hospital. The cookies had an expiration date of 5/2/2012 but they were STALE. This was very embarrassing and disappointing to say the least. This tells me that food products are not a good buy from Amazon.
0;Charleston Vanilla Chew must have been subjected to very high heat as each bar opened so far had the inner part melted and partially leaked to the outside of the chocolate.  To make things worse the melted inner part has welded itself to the cardboard wrapper and cannot be totally removed.  You therefore are eating cardboard with the candy. It is not warm outside so I would be very surprised if the trucking company who delivered it was at fault.
0;"""It really isn't a POWDER.  It is more like a finely ground loose tea and won't blend in a smoothie because it is not ground finely enough.  Get Tradition brand if you want to make smoothies.  (It isn't organic"
0;The freshness wasn't a problem with this order...however there was a problem.  The chocolate on the Fudge Stripes was all melted off of the cookies and was stuck to the inside of the package.  Another no go for repeat sales.

0;Unfortunately my dog didn't go for this product. The bone casing was pretty hard for her to get through and the stuffing wasn't enticing enough for her to even try. She is a Shitzu but has no problem with hard bones or treats. She carried this one around for a couple of hours and then never bothered with it again.
0;I was extremely exited to locate a source of concentrated pomegranate flavor. I spotted this in a cooking magazine recommended by a famous chef. I bought three bottles assuming the many ideas for experimenting with the flavor being put to use. The flavor and color is not very good and brown respectively. It seems as though bad pomegranates or spoiled ones were used to make this. I do not think this is worth purchasing for any use whatsoever and suggest you avoid this product. I will be throwing out my three bottles.&#128541

So I tried it from other blenders and most often liked it (Twinning's bagged version of the tea isn't bad"
0;"""Further info:  I took a bowl to my PCP and he told me that the excessive amount of salt in the flavor package most likely caused the pain in my chest and could very well give me physical problems such as a heart attack/stroke.

0;Crystal light has always been carbohydrate free. This product has carbohydrates which will elevate the blood sugar in people with diabetes.<br /><br />Amazon made a BIG ERROR in not revealing that this product has carbohydrates.TOTALLY misleading and this should have been explained.

This is deceitful to those who believe that this product is safe for those with diabetes. Shame on you Amazon.
0;"""I am very disappointed that Gerber has added DHA to their green beans. My son used to Love his Gerber Organic Green Beans. I (unwittingly) tried feeding him the new formulation with added DHA and he kept refusing it. I did notice that the consistency was different than usual - it had more of a gel like texture to it. And then I read the ingredients and saw that it had added Tuna Oil. !? Today I learned that another of his favorites"
0;I am not happy with Gerber at all.  I researched their products and they do not have to list ingredients if below a certain percentage.  (LIKE IF GREEN BEANS WERE MADE ON A CONVEYER OF WHERE RICE WAS MADE AND THE RICE WAS UNDER A CERTAIN AMOUNT TRACED THEY DO NOT LIST IT ON THE INGREDIENTS).  The beans I did not know have fish oil in it.  It is now listed on the product ingredients.
0;"""I often find the Starbucks K cups yield a moldy and rancid tasting brew. We have tried an assortment of Starbucks K cups flavors obtained at numerous outlets over the last year. It feels like this is a secondary (or even tertiary) market for Starbucks beans that don't make the grade. Or possibly Starbucks has production/storage/transportation issues when bringing the Starbucks K cups to market. It is a ding to the brand. Luckily"
0;I ordered this bouquet to be delivered to my daughter for opening night of a show. I specifically ordered a gerbera daisy bouquet that featured ALL daisies and no other flowers because these are my daughter's favorite flower.  The bouquet she received had ONE gerbera daisy in a bouquet of some other type of flower that resembled daisies. While she appreciated the flowers the bouquet she received was definitely NOT what I ordered.  very disappointed!!!
0;"""I purchased these very large cans of chili because they were priced ridiculously cheaply at the time. I planned to split the cans up into smaller portions and freeze the smaller portions to make a large number of meals. The first can I opened looked a little different from other Hormel chili I have had in the past. The beans were all mashed up and there were large chunks of cubed meat in the chili. Normally the meat resembles little pieces of ground meat. These were weird unappetizing chunks. The chili had no chili taste. It tasted like slightly burned re-fried beans. The night after eating this and the next day"

0;I have been a brewer for 15 years. And this is a jar of crap. I got zero fermentation. Nothing. It is a jar of Dead Yeast. I tried making a starter two differant times and nothing. The only thing it can be used for is as a nutrient for actual good yeast.

0;These were so horrible that my husband & I spit them out & threw away the box.  We buy lots of all-natural products that are 100% whole grain but these were horrid.  Didn't expect them to taste like Honey Maid Graham Crackers but  expected them to have some flavor.  Yuck!
0;Everything was expired- so disappointing!!! I thought this would make a cute gift for my step dad but unfortunately he wasnt able to enjoy 90% of it.  It wasnt just a couple months expired either..it was over a year old!
0;"""I actually received this gift.  half of it was inedible (processed brie cheese?  seriously?) and the rest was a low-quality product in fancy packaging (honey-roasted peanuts?).  it is totally absurd to pay $50"
0;please dont buy dog food with corn as the main ingredient...they cant digest it....and it will pass it through....spend a little more and you will be glad you did......as in less dog waste....better fur  and a happy full dog...with a little internet research a 20# bag will cost about $5 more.....is it worth it to you????
0;"""When I ordered this from Always Direct the gum shell was very hard and crumbly and had somewhat of a chalky taste and the flavor lasted for about 5 seconds of a chew once I got through the hard and crumbly shell. FYI for bubble gum lovers: when the outer shell of the gumball starts to crumble off the gum itself"
0;I have ordered these items two seperate times.  Both times most of the bisconti were broken into 2 or more pieces and the chocolet had melted to the degree that it was difficult to open the individual packages.
0;I ordered two cakes for my sister in Atlanta.  Only one cake came.  When I called customer service they said they would call me back.  They never did! Never again.  I don't have money to give away! Too bad I was going to order fifty cakes for a party.
0;"""There is no way I would have known beforehand exactly how Greek coffee tasted.  I went on the recommendation of an article citing it's medicinal qualities. I'm sorry but this was the worst tasting coffee I've EVER had! The seller was quick and had a good price but again"
0;"""I ordered this product from Amazon because we are not able to find the original Cream of Wheat in local stores. Apparently the manufacturer drastically modified the product but left the packaging the same. I ordered this based on the reviews. Don't believe it! The flavor"
0;picture of the product looked good - when i recieved it the individual candies were all upside down & a complete mess.  the cardboard strap holding the candies together was almost completely ripped. the crate was all chipped & discolored. i would never order or recommend this to anyone. i never did recieve the other 3.90 shipping charges i was entitled to .
0;"""These chocolate bottles are disappointingly filled with a liquor flavored jelly instead of the tiny bit of real liquor our family has come to love and enjoy at the holidays. If you're looking for flavor"
0;The crate is broken in several places.  The tiny bottles were strewn all over the place and at least one of them is leaking.  This is my second purchase from the Amazon site and I am very leery of making any other purchases. I would like to return this and get my money back.
0;I love hint water so when I saw they offered hint fizz I had to try it. It is the worst thing I have ever tasted. Straight soda water with absolutely no HINT of watermelon. I wrote to the company regarding any form of customer satisfaction guarantee and as of now I have not heard from them.  This has been 2 weeks now.
0;Erythritol is a highly processed sugar alcohol polyol which is considered in Europe as synthetic and is not classed as natural nor organic. These are known as ' fake iols ' in the sweetener business. There are reported problems with eyesight and digestion. Google search erythritol dangers.
0;I baked cookies using Organic Zero fro the first time. I have had significant bloating and abdominal pain since I ate the cookies. Wondering if it could be caused by the sugar substitute? It is the first time I have used it and the only new itme that went in the cookies.
0;"""I do not like this product at all.  It is expensive and especially if you give it away.  It has a very nasty taste that I cannot describe.  The more you use the worse it gets.  I am going back to other things.  Perhaps AGAVE or I may go back to Nevella"
0;"""It isn't sweet. You are getting 3.5 cups of nonsweet  sweetener? <br />You are getting 1.5 pounds of nothing. Three heaping teaspoons in a 8 oz. cup of coffee did nothing. I'm throwing it out. Agave isn't calorie free but it is sweet"
0;We love all things spicy and Mexican but this sauce is not worth it. It is very mild and has little chipotle flavor. It looks like Thousand Island dressing but adds no flavor. Empty and flavorless calories. My recommendation (if you want a kick to your sauce) is the Frontera brand. Now that one has flavor and spice!
0;I ordered this product hoping it would really change my mind about using whey or soy. I didnt. I have to mix it with my other protein just so i can drink it. It taste like dirt and grass. Not s very good product.
0;THis was my second order of this product the first order was OUTSTANDING but the second was terrible.  Hope the manufacture can return to the original quality.  Amazon needs to TEST and promote the quality of this product if/when it is restocked with good quality.
0;"""It leaked so bad the UPS delivery guy did not even deliver -they said that they will send it back to Amazon directly. (It also damaged other goods packed in the same box!) I ordered a replacement. The second one leaked again! This time UPS delivered it (to let me see for myself?) It was BAD. I did not want to return leaked oil so I tried to use the leftover but NO mist came out - only big drops! It is much cheaper to buy regular canola oil in bottle than a  mister   that leak and give no mist.  Will not buy this product again."""
0;"""Sore lips. Bought these when they were on sale in the little packets. My children complained that these are way too salty. There were about two teaspoons of salt left at the bottom of a tiny pouch. Yuk"
0;"""Either these folks are completely ignorant or they think putting   no genetically engineered ingredients  on the front of the package will cause us to to ignore their list of ingredients on the back.  Canola oil is made from genetically modified rapeseed. They also say it may have Safflower or Sunflower oil"
0;The first shipment was stale.  The second case was not as stale but stale nonetheless.  I'm not sure if it is staleness or just plain grossness.  I like other chips by Garden of Eatin'.  Will the birds eat them?  What do I do with all these chips?  Amazon was great about sending me a replacement when I complained about the first case.
0;I opened a bag of these chips. I thought I detected a strange odor but put one into my mouth anyway.<br /><br />The chips were definitely rancid. I tried several other bags and discovered the same rancid taste.<br /><br />I threw them all away. Caveat emptor.
0;I've order the Seasame Blues before and thought they were great. The 7.5 ounce bags are round compared to the triangles. When you open the bag you get a strong odor of bad oil. The taste also has the bad oil to it. Unfortunately I sent a box to my sister after bragging about them. I called company but no word yet.
0;We had ordered this chips before and really loved them in the past. For some reason our last order (despite not being expired until December of 2010) has tasted horrible and stale. I am really considering whether I'll order them again.
0;"""I received this product from Amazon who sent me the oldest stock possible. The postage alone cost about $60 and i ordered about $60 worth of the product. Most of the items I received were only 2 to 3 weeks from their sell by date and are rancid or stale. It was a huge disappointment receiving these and I will never order this product again.Neither will i recommend anyone buy this product from Amazon. It makes you think that Garden of Eatin products are not good but I have bought them before at my local grocery store and they tasted great"
0;I bought Greenmountain Vermont Country Blend for my home Keurig brewer because it was so good at work.  Got my box delivered to my home and was disappointed to find it way too weak.  Nothing like the brew at work.  I opened up a K-cup and added more coffee to it from another one and it was  normal (very good).  I'm getting an RMA number and sending it back along with the pumpkin spice coffee which was also too weak.
0;We brewed 2 cups of the Vermont Country Blend and found very weak.  We brewed about 5 cups of the Tullys House Blend and did not care for the taste.  I should have gotten all San Francisco Bay coffee's. We purchased French Roast and one other flavor and my whole family loves this coffee.
0;"""I am not sure about this product. I have opened the first of three bags of the almonds and they seem to be stale. They are not crunchy like they should be. I will retract if the second and third bags are different. If they are the same"
0;"""I tried this food for about 6 days.  The first day our elderly cat began to throw-up.  At first I thought it was just a coincidence since he is so fragile.  I stopped giving him this food and with tummy meds he got better.  By the 4th day"
0;"""Raw Cacao has a high Vitamin C content. This product has O% if you look at the label on the back.<br />Within the last year they covered up where it used to say Vitamin C with Vitality. If you look closely on some of the older packages"
0;I am used to ordering the nibs and grinding them myself.  The result is the richest chocolate flavore one can imagine!  This on the other hand left a gritty texture in the pudding I made and has a bitter flavor that could not be masked by even major amounts of sugar and very mild hint of chocolate.  First time ever my daughter said she didn't want her 'chocolate' pudding.
0;This product looked absolutely nothing like the picture. Both in presentation and actual product. The fruit did not appear fresh and they were sparse. The basket was basically filler. I was with the receiver when this arrived and I was embrassed to have sent this to her.
0;The picture of the product shows a bounty of fruit.  Lots of fruit. Fruit spilling over.<br />What you get is a few items of fruit. Very few. The basket is the the only true depiction.<br />A definite misrepresentation.  Don't waste your money.
0;The Calif fruit basket I had purchased for my sister happened to have shown up at her house while I was there.  The pears were not nice and two were all ready rotten. The kiwi were already too soft but edible as we used them in fruit salad the day they arrived. I would not use this company again.
0;Disappointed in the receipt of this product. This box was so damaged it lost the box it was mailed in and was leaking from several cans of the product. This was the worst I have ever received a product over the 10 plus years I have been ordering on line. I lost 3 cans of monster because of the damage and will never order this product through the mail again. The product is heavy so sending it back was more expensive then just keeping the damaged product.only had a picture (no video)or would show damaged product.
0;"""I thought this product was going to put me through the roof in a whirlwind of hyper activity. It did not. I didn't even get a boost of energy during or right after drinking it. I am not a caffine or energy drink user. I have 1 cup of coffee every morning and that is it so I figured this might really have an impact on me. It has not. It did not taste very good and made the corners of my mouth sticky. Also"
0;My dogs love them but they are loaded with junk and come from another country. these went in the trash once i read that. I buy USA only and not loaded with junk like caramel coloring or anything thats a preservative. stay away from these. not good for your dogs.
0;What a waste of $$ buying things I think my dogs would love to chew on. They didnt give these bully things a 2nd look after sniffing for the 1st time I put it in their play area... Welp I am surely gonna stick to DINGO's maybe a little pricy but at least they are going to EAT IT!
0;"""I purchased this product at a local specialty foods store.  Every time I have used it my lips and tongue have burned as if using cinnamon oil.  The  cherry  flavor is akin to what cherry cough drops and medicines used to taste like decades ago.  Based on this experience"
0;"""I have ordered this product twice. The product tastes fine. The problem is with breakage.<br /><br />The first time I ordered this product from Amazon more than 1/2 of the Bagel Snacks in all the boxes where broken into various size pieces. Since I had bought this product at the store before buying it a Amazon"
0;I received ten very small sticks with not much rock candy on them(a lot less than the normal amount of rock candy on swizzle sticks I've seen in the stores.)<br />Too much money for product( $11 plus 4 shipping!)
0;"""If there was a ZERO star rating guess what? I rarely write reviews but had to warn everyone that if you remotely think this is going to taste like ice cream you will be highly disappointed.  It taste like iced"
0;These used to be so good and I used to buy them by the bunch but ever since they switched from Aspartame to Sucralose they are the grossest most disgusting thing out there. Nevermind I hate the taste of Sucralose But I am one of the few I guess where Sucralose makes me violently ill. The Wintergreen ones still are amazing though because they are using Aspartame still but I don't see that lasting very long. Almost every sugar free product is switching to Sucralose.
0;The product description says a pack of six with 6 count each for a total of 36 counts.  A normal person reading this would be led to believe that they would receive six boxes of granola bars.  Not the case.  I received only one measly box of granola bars.  I was certainly not a happy customer because I paid for almost 12 dollars for one box of granola bar.  I could have gotten it much cheaper at the grocery store.  This is a the first time I experienced this from Amazon.  They should totally change the product description to 1 box of 6 granola bars instead of the misleading description.
0;I am a fishing guide. I spend more time than most trying to ward off pesky misquitos. I have been useing cutter products with good success. I saw the reviews and decided to try the cutter advanced....Advanced means better right?...WRONG! ..Big Mistake!! This stuff is almost worthless. It may be better than nothing but I have apllied  3 times as much 5 times as often. Despite this..  I am continually being eaten alive by misquitos using this product. Its a wonder to me that it is still on the market? Do Not waste your money like I did.
0;"""The worst raspberry salad dressing available. The flavors (olive oil?) are fighting each other. It smells atrocious... like someone's dirty feet after pouring vinegar on them. And the odor lingers in the air"
0;first of all I like Frenchs regular and deli mustards but when it comes to horseradish mustard they really havent got a clue there horseradish mustard sucks its not hot at all you cannot tast the horseradish at all in fact it does not even tast like mustard if you want a good horseradish mustard look up Silver Spring Farms on the net and try there collection of fresh horseradish and mustards and there horseradish mustard is great.
0;"""I did not buy this item from you.  I just had to post how disgusted I was that you would sell this item at such an unbelievable high price! It is not right.  You can purchase these for MUCH cheaper right now right through  the factory that makes them. I see that you have good ratings"
0;I bought these sausages along with some Merguez sausage (Algerian Lamb Sausage). The merguez was wonderful and I am going to order them again soon. However the saucisse de Toulouse were close to inedible. They were chewy and had hard lumps in them.
0;ordered on feb first-- today is feb-27 still no order--- told out of stock - but as when I ordered - amazon says it's in stock.. SO ORDER BUT DONT LOOK FOR YOUR ORDER FOR 30 - 40 DAYS( CANT SAY DONT HAVE THEM YET)
0;"""The beans smell like a low quality smoldering cigar. Like the beans have been burnt. Coffee tastes equally horrible. My guess is they really screwed up the roasting process and are just trying to recover some of their cost. So if you're excited to see  gourmet  beans for so cheap"
0;"""Ordered  Dark Magic K-Cup - Box of 2 . Therefore should be each box of 24 x 2 = 48 K-cups. I only received 1 box of 24. The company changes its name frequently and sends wrong quantity. Beware of non- Amazon sellers. Amazon contacted and will investigate the fraud. However"
0;In 2010 when I bought my Keurig K-cups were about $.42 each. Now they are $.60 each! My Keurig has been just taking up counter space now. And K-cups are too much plastic and foil waste for the land-fill. I want to like this product but it just doesn't make any sense. And the coffee is bitter.
0;I ordered this because I wanted a taste of home.  I live overseas and I am a big pepperoni and jerky fan. I was disappointed in what i got.  The quality is at best average and because of this it is greatly overpriced.  It would have been overpriced at half the price. Next time i will have someone go to 7 eleven and buy some for me.  It will be cheaper and better quality.
0;"""Ineffective and worthless. I bought this product for indoors and two other outdoor fly traps.  The outdoor traps worked immediately and I have noticed less flies in my home from my backdoor over the past week.  However"
0;"""We had a problem with a lot of fruit flies in our kitchen.  I picked up one of these to take care of business despite spotty reviews.  Oops.<br /><br />We had it up for several days and I saw one fly land on it the entire time.  The best part of this tragic story is that when I picked up the trap to investigate the one trapped fly...I'l be darned if that fly didn't pick up his feet and take off. That's right"
0;"""I put this fly trap in the kitchen and didn't catch a single fly.  We only have flies in late August and September when the temperature warms.  So we don't have window screens.  The flies were especially bad this year"
0;What a horrible product. First of all the item does not work. I have had it up for a week with lots of flies around it and they simply avoid it. Infact the will sit on the window next to it but never go to it. Also it does no look like the one pictured You get the idea that there are small boxes for the flies to enter. Not so. Mine came with black and pink srips running from the top to the bottom. WASTE OF MONEY
0;"""I wish I'd read the reviews before making this purchase. It's basically a cardsotck box that is sticky all over the OUTSIDE. Those pink-ish things that look like entrances  into  the trap? They're just pictures. There *is no* inside of the trap. All the flies will be stuck to the OUTSIDE. It's basically fly paper"
0;Worst product I have gotten in long time. Would rate it as no star if I could.  Simply did not catch a single fly or bug of any sort.  Went to the hardware store and bought the old-fashioned spiral fly paper which was very effective.  Had an unuasual influx of flys in the house this fall and needed to do something.
0;"""Okay so I have a little garden in my back yard that attracts a lot of flies and I have been looking for a way to combat them once they are in the house. I wasn't sure if they still made Fly Paper but when I saw this after searching in the great Amazon I was excited. From the moment I opened the box I was dismayed and I seriously cannot decide if this is a joke or not. The packaging says the box has stunning 3-d images to draw in the flies"
0;This is nothing more than a cardboard box with a little dry adhesive on the outside. It does nothing to attract flies and the adhesive is not gluey enough to trap them if they do happen to land on it. Save your money.
0;With hundreds of common house flies all about for 24 hours and not a single one caught I resorted to a fly swatter and killed 50 or so in 1-2 hours with my old fly swatter. This fly trap appears useless.
0;"""I had looked all over for a place to purchase these flatbread crackers.  I could not find them locally so I went to Amazon.  I was so excited to find them.  Placed an order for 6 boxes.  When I received them"
0;"""I requested this item from the Amazon Vine program and decided to have my family help me get more info for my review. I love eating healthy and was looking forward to a better alternative to the already semi-healthy granola I was enjoying. So"
0;"""My cat just won't eat it.  She tried a few bits and sat up for a few moments after each bite and acted like she was trying to figure out what was odd about the taste.  I've never seen her do that.  She wouldn't eat it.  I tried mixing it with some Fancy Feast"
0;"""I was not aware of and was not told the country of origin when I purchased a case of Newman's Own Organics Canned Dog Food..  This product is made in Uruguay not the USA!! It made both of my dogs sick with severe diarrhea.  Blue Buffalo was out of stock so I thought  Newman's Own  indicated it would be a good product made in the USA.  WRONG!!!"""
0;We got our Canned Beef from Amazon around last summer but opened it just now.  It smells vile.  No way we are giving it our dogs.  Not sure if this a variation or do they always smell that bad.  Definitely deleting it from the Subscribe and Save list.
0;"""just received a case of 12 chicken & brown rice formula...every single can was dented beyond use...this was a problem before and supposedly amazon was to get their shipping problem with this item corrected...it states that this item is not returnable although damaged"
0;"""I bought these pen to write quotes on  letter cookies  but the tip was not as fine as I was expected. Maybe is just a personal preference. I then try them on cake pops made with candy melts and the pen stopped working after 2 and has not worked since. I will try another brand next time."""
0;Do not buy Fi-Shock products I used Fi-Shock PT-200 poly wire and it cut my hands no warning on using gloves.  The instructions do not tell you how make electrical connection.  Made 4 calls to company and sent 4 emails No Help.
0;Expired Chips!!!<br /><br />My Husband and I went to London on our honeymoon and loved these chips.  I thought purchasing these chips would be a great addition to my anniversay gift to him.  Big mistake... The chips expired over 7 months ago.
0;"""I ordered this as a Christmas present. When we opened it we found out that you need about $200 worth of equipment to make this. I am an amateur beer maker and thought this would be alot of fun. When you order extra there it says REFILL kit. That is EXACTLY what this is! A REFILL KIT!!! This advertising is extremely deceptive. It also says nothing about all the extra equipment you will need"
0;"""I wanted to love this because of all its positive aspects. Very low mercury. Sustainably caught. Responsible company and packaging. And - I THOUGHT it was fully caught AND packed in the USA* (*It is packed in Vietnam.)  See their web site"
0;"""I love soda probably more than I should and one of my favorite flavors for it is cherry. But this soda was sickeningly sweet. I had a Cherokee Red and then this and the Switch tasted like bad cough syrup. I know they claim that it's only good ingredients and nothing bad for you in it"
0;"""Some may like this product but I'm not one of them. I've tried three different flavors and have found all of them to be too sweet anand consequently are not good at quenching one's thirst. The size is nice but really"
0;These are not 100% Sweet Potato as I believed they were. My dogs licked off the top and cannot eat the 99% hard matter that is not Sweet Potato. These are tooooo pricy to be sooooo dissappointed in this product.
0;"""I ordered these to serve at a Thanksgiving get together but I had to throw them away.  They were absolutely disgusting.  Everything underneath the outside plastic was covered in a sticky mess.  Every single candy in the box was sticky"
0;"""BEWARE!! CONTAINS ADDED SUGAR--LOTS OF IT!! I was surprised when I checked the ingredient list on the cans when they arrived to see that sugar is added. Many of the reviews mentioned the sweetness of the coconut water without mentioning the sugar addition"
0;I can't say what a good Kobe steak tastes like because the package of 20 steatks that I received were spoiled.<br />I am greatly dismayed at the handling of this expensive delivery. I'll have to try a Kobe at an fine restaurant instead of on my home grill.
0;I love Swedish Fish but was horrified when I received a bag of deceased fish!  The bag was torn open in the box.  Some were hard as rocks.  Others had melted into a bloody red mess.  What are you made of that you can house both extremes in one bag?  I'll never eat one again.  I've switched to blue gummy sharks.
0;This product is PAST the sell by date and is defintiely noticable in the taste. I fell for the low price -- BAD FOR ME.<br />I'm out the money.  I suggest buying from your grocery store before buying these items.
0;"""My shitzu pups love these treats but I just read the fine print and discovered that the California company imports this from china. Given what is put in baby formula in china I can't imagine what they might put in dog treats. Sadly"
0;"""At $15 for 5 pounds these lentils cost $3 a pound.  My wife was very unhappy with me as she can get them for a dollar a pound at the store.  I told her - these are super lentils and she said they better be for the price.  Kidding aside - don't buy these"
0;"""Get the carrot & apple or pear & mango flavor from Plum Organics instead.  This was overwhelmingly sweet.  Like giving my babies candy.  The  Yello One  is almost as bad.  I recommend sticking with the other flavors"
0;When I opened the box a good portion of the product had leaked through HOLES throughout the bag. As far as I am concerned this product is GARBAGE bc they won't let me return it. I'm not ingesting an open bag of product. It was an expensive lesson!
0;"""I was given sweetleaf choc but its a totally different taste than the usual one I buy from you and it says  sweetdrops  which I didn't ask for.  I don't care for it at all. The packaging is different too which probably means the ingredients are different.  Will not be ordering it again unless this is replaced with my usual. Sorry."""
0;"""I have been a big buyer of amazon goods and from amazon shops over the years and have already tried to be understanding of some of the more  niche  stores. However Bonsai Boy has been one Niche to far. They have been the most obnoxious customer service I have ever received. It was like the monty python sketch"
0;"""I found this brand on Petsmart's website as an online only special. The price was excellent (~$1 per lb). The list of ingredients and quality seemed good and my dog liked it so I was happy. Then I went to order it again and have found that their prices have sky rocketed! Now they are in the same glut as all the other  designer  dog foods that have ridiculous price tags. Didn't you hear?...people are getting rid of their pets because they can't afford to feed them and this company is of no help. Unbelievable! Well"
0;I have been ordering K cups from Coffee Cow for 2 years and I will go back to them ASAP.  There were 2 kcups in each of the boxes that were broken and tea...very  very fine tea... was everywhere...not 2 mention I was now 4 cups short.  The remaining cups were one third the weight of the Timothy's tea I had on the shelf.  The tea tastes like dish water. I will never order this again. What a waste of money!
0;I couldn't wait to have decaf english breakfast tea k-cups!  I was so disappointed when they arrived because the tea leaves must be too tiny as they end up coming out of the k-cup during brewing and you end up with almost the entire k-cup of tea leaves floating in your tea cup.  YUK.  I am so disappointed.  I wish someone would come up with a good decaf k-cup of english breakfast tea... please!
0;This is the worst tasting tea ever. It really tastes just like cardboard and I am shocked that it doesn't have less stars. I recommend Celestial Seasoning Tea over this - tastes like real tea instead of packaging. You cannot return it either so don't bother buying it.
0;I had to order this twice and still have not received it!!! I ordered it the second time on Feb 6 and it says it's in stock but they're not shipping it until Feb 26!!! I am canceling my order and will not shop from these people again!!!! I should not have to wait well over a month for something and then not even be able to contact them about it!!!!
0;We tried one packet of each of the assortment. Each one was virtually tasteless. The peppermint felt like grit. The marshmellows might as well have been missing. Could barely taste any salt in the salted caramel.
0;My dog and others love this treat. The problem is that hundreds and thousands of dogs have died in the US after consuming these treats. One death was that of a good friend as it killed her beautiful German Shepard.  Her death was completely avoidable because the problem with these treats was known but not publically shared. Purina claims these treats are safe and yet hundreds of dogs have died after eating them.  These treats are made in China where the problem first occured with dog and cat food years ago. Back then the problems resulted in the same initial denial.  Please read related articles on this subject and make an informed decision about purchasing these treats.
0;My son loves strawberry Nesquik and we always seem to be running out of it.  I was thrilled when I found out I could buy it in bulk from Amazon.  The problem?  We live in the Midwest and this is not the same formula that I buy here at the grocery store.  The color of this Nesquik bought from Amazon is a bright neon pink and smells different from the strawberry Nesquik that I buy from a local store.  I didn't mention the difference to my 3 1/2 year old when I gave him some milk made with this strawberry Nesquik (made in Mexico?) and he immediately gave me the drink back and said he didn't like it and that it tasted bad.  Buyer beware!  This cannot be returned because it's a grocery item...nothing like throwing 15 bucks directly into the garbage!

0;"""I ordered a box of plain milk chocolate. The large amount of chocolate was part of an elaborate gift. I was sent a box of milk chocolate WITH ALMONDS. I whole heatedly LOATHE almonds. The gift did not call for almonds and was ruined. Absolute waste of 36 bars of chocolate. I would be less offended if this was the first time I heard of this problem. After reading other reviews"
0;"""My rib eye steaks were tough as a boot - hardly any smoke flavor at all actually.  And don't believe that your meet  browns  up.  It was gray an unappetizing.  And yes I did snip a hole in the top last minutes.  Waste of money."""
0;I have to say I'm quite a fan of Ramune soda.....just not at this price. I know there should be a store SOMEWHERE wherever you might live that sells this soda or just some other online store. It's just not worth it at this price. Even if you were using amazon.com credit (which I am) I wouldn't waste my money on this. It's a shame.

0;"""I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description. It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond"
0;"""I bought the Cranberry Almond and the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio. I'm not sure how anyone can comment on the flavor - it's sooooo sweet. The non GMO glucose + the sugar + the honey masks any flavor this bar might have. It's my fault. I should have read more closely. Not sure I understand how this is a  Low glycemic  food. Definitely not a KIND option if you're trying to reduce your overall sugar consumption."""
0;"""I was so excited to buy these fruit bars because they are just so good. I ordered this KIND PLUS Almond Cashew PACK OF 12 and guess what? When I openned the package this morning I was so confused if there was anything wrong... Instead of 12 fruit bars"
0;This bar just tastes plain weird.<br />There. I said it.<br /><br />I love KIND PLUS bars in general...they are like candy but with nuts and other awesome things.<br /><br />The Mango one tasted like Mango and coconut - and entirely TOO SWEET. Almost sickeningly so. Won't be buying the mango one again.
0;This is the second box I received from two different sellers (Amazon was the other one) and both arrived all broken up and stale.  Maybe they are freezing on the way to California but definitely not like the ones I purchased at the store which were fresh & chewy.  These were like plastic wrapped broken brick.
0;"""The first box I received tasted fine but the second box arrived stale.<br />Amazon does not allow returns on food so that does not leave much confidence in ordering any further.<br />It's too bad because this particular mix is the best out of all of them as some of them can taste really disgusting"
0;"""Formula has changed as well as where the product is made and it shows!!!  None of the packageing indicates these changes.  Not half as good in flavoring as it used to be along with the fact that it is now higher in fat % which has affected the taste and the calorie count......would not buy unless the calorie counts goes back to 150 or less. Whatever changed to accomodate the fat change also affected the flavor big time.....almost tastes blah.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D05RWC >KIND PLUS"
0;"""I bought this product for a kidney cleanse tea suggested by Edgar Cayce. There was no description on the product page but the price seemed to be right so I purchased a bag. The seller shipped it in a timely manner and when I got it"
0;"""This coffee tastes like chocolate that's gone bad.  It's overpriced and just not very good.  Starbucks has always over-roasted their beans.  I guess if you like that then you might like this coffee.  To my tastebuds however"
0;I sent these baskets to my two grandkids.  What did they get?  A worthless piece of junk that I could have bought at the dollar store for less than a dollar!  BE WARNED DO NOT BUY THESE AT THE VERY LEAST IT IS FALSE ADVERTISING. I didn't want to give it one star but couldn't publish the review unless I answered the question.  If I could rate it minus 5 stars I  would although it probably doesn't even rate that.
0;"""I had high hopes for this product because I like Splenda & I normally drink diet soda anyway. So I feel like I'm used to the  after-taste  that non-diet soda drinkers complain of. Unfortunately it was awful! The first sip was o.k. but by the 3rd"
0;The Margarita Mix is excellent!  I've also had the Cranberry Martini Mix which is pretty good.  But this was really disappointing.  The coconut taste is off and it has an aftertaste.  And it feels like something is coating my mouth after I drink it.  I bought a 3-bottle package and will have to toss it.
0;"""I began purchasing this brand at my local walmart store on the suggestion of a friend.  The lable suggests that feeding your animal this product will make their waste firmer and less frequent.  That part was certainly true. Unfortunately the ingredients in this food are shown by a variety of other websites to cause allergic reactions or worse in animals.  After a visit to the vet's office to treat a severe case of rash"
0;"""My dog HATES this dog food. She turns her head away from it and refuses to even put it in her mouth. I bought a 1-lb bag at a local pet store(I thought they were treats) and she LOVED it. But they were not small bites. There is something different between the regular and small bites. The only difference mentioned on the labels is duck"
0;I bought since it seemed like a great deal but when i made a batch it was awful. It had a weak taste and the aroma was as if it was old coffee. Completely disappointing i love trying all coffees and expected more from this. Will never buy again. I thought i would never have to say this but Dunkin Doughnuts is way superior so try that first. Seattle Best is a great coffee as well.
0;The Taste of this Chocolate almost made me pack up my Keurig and take it Back to the store! I purchased this Hot Cocoa out of excitement when I brought my Mr. Coffee Keurig on sale for Black Friday.  I am an avid hot cocoa drinker and this by far is the worst tasting chocolate in my opinion. It was watery and had an awful artificial sweetener aftertaste. Granted the first time I did not shake the K-cup as directed so I gave it a second try after shaking. Surprisingly it didn't do a d@mn thing to help the taste! On the bright side if you long for a watered down artificial sweetener as an after taste in a drink then this is the K-cup for you.
0;Recently tried this milk chocolate k cup from Amazon. The only thing this drink has in common with chocolate is its color.Of the 13 items listed as ingredients  cocoa is number 8.It has a chemical smell and a chemical taste.If you buy this junk don't say you were not warned. It does not deserve ANY stars.
0;Our family loves to have hot chocolate on a cold winter's day and this is not hot chocolate.  I don't know what it is.  You need to find another product for your Keurig if you are looking for hot chocolate.  Please do not waste your money on this product.  There is no quality control on this one.  How Keurig thinks this is good is beyond me.
0;I agree with the other one-star reviews. It has a strange flavor unlike chocolate and more like chemicals. It's watery. I will try a different brand of hot chocolate or just use my personal K cup to put in my own hot chocolate mixes.
0;"""Be cautious about all store dog foods. My dog had been eating Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Fish and developed digestive issues and almost died.  I thought it was a number of things. Had lots of tests run and then one of my clients dogs developed the same issues with his dog on the same dog food and has also spent a lot of money trying to correct the gut issue. Can't prove anything as we got rid of the dog food"
0;"""I have been a faithful buyer of Natural Balance for years for my large dog with allergies.  Thinking I was getting the best.<br /><br />My dog developed a yeast infection that my vet told me was allergies.  He has constant ear infections"
0;"""This product made my dog very sick. He is an older 11 year old pug with allergies and this particular mix is supposed to be good with allergies. I decided to try it because my vet had run out of Science Diet Salmon and Sweet Potato and I found this very reputable looking dog food with free shipping on Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Within 3 days off feeding it to my dog he seemed to loose all energy and my wife was concerned we wouldn't have him very much longer. I then Googled the brand and found a recall due to salmonella contamination! Granted"
0;I have bough Larry's coffee in the past and it was ok. This last batch was awful! The beans were not fresh and it taste only slightly better than Maxwell house! do yourself a favor and get coffee from coffee bean direct on amazon. WAY better coffee at a way better price
0;"""You know how in China and Japan they mostly eat white rice but at the same time some really smart integrated health care professionals in America insist that brown rice would be healthier because it has more minerals"
0;I had bought similar treats for my dogs in the past and they loved them.  But these came individually wrapped in plastic which permeated the chew with a plastic smell (and I assume flavor).  My dogs won't touch them.  Don't waste your money.
0;"""The  Healthy Indulgence  pouches of cat food are prepared with FLUORIDATED water! A number of studies have now shown that fluoridated water increases the risk of osteosarcoma or bone cancer in humans and animals. Alone from my own circle of friends"
0;"""A real waste of $$$ - Don't know what I was expecting...the product's own PR only makes vague claims for renewed health after drinking this over 2 days.<br />Didn't bring about any sort of  cleanse  (as in colonic) for me"
0;"""For the health-conscious - read the ingredients.<br /><br />Aspartame:<br /><br />Aspartame accounts for over 75 percent of the adverse reactions to food additives reported to the FDA. Many of these reactions are very serious including seizures and death. A few of the 90 different documented symptoms listed in the report as being caused by aspartame include: Headaches/migraines"
0;Love Jif Peanut Butter and placed an order through Amazon for the 2 48oz jars for $19.00 then visited my local Walmart and found 2 40oz jars for $9.24.  I like the concept of buying through Amazon with no shipping and no tax.  But I got taken on this order.
0;"""I ordered this product believing it was a good product at a great price.<br /><br />The package arrived just now via UPS. The box had been torn open and was barely being held together at the bottom by a half removed strip of packing tape. Almost all of the cans were damaged"
0;I was excited for this but disappointed when I got it. It's salty (very salty) unlike the sweeter ones from Japanese restaurants. The outside is also a thick texture that I had to remove. It wasn't as crunchy as it should be.
0;I love Pirate's booty aged white cheddar and thought these would be just as good- but was I WRONG! They are awful-no pleasant crunch-no flavor at all! I am going to try the other Pirate Booty flavors in a variety pack and hope they are not as foul as these. Don't know how they got these so wrong when the aged white cheddar is so DELICIOUS!!!
0;"""It tastes great but doesn't stand up to scientific testing on its claim of  low-carb  or their other marketing.  Dreamfield's is a fraud.  Just search for National Institute of Health on their findings for this pasta and its affect on blood.  In part  In 10 people without diabetes"
0;I ignored the reviews because I figured it would not be that bad. Was I ever wrong. Very disappointed in the horrible selection. Not even one iced tea. Not one. And half of the regular tea was Green Tea. What a joke. Do yourself a favor and just move on. I wish I did.<br /><br />Amazon you should be ashamed of this product. You need to seriously consider how this process works.
0;I was very disappointed when I received the product(s).  The 35 K-cups were loose in the packaging box.  The product is described as a pack of 35. I am uncomfortable that the K-cups are not in a sealed box from the manufacturer.  How do I know these cups were not discarded leftovers from serveral variety packs?  I doubt I'll use the K-cups and there are no returns.  Buyer beware.
0;"""This review is intended to help buyers make an intelligent decision as to the reason for buying this product. I emailed Now Foods requesting information concerning the mercury content of their granulated fructose because I consume so much of it. Their response was  mercury is less than 400 parts per billion . For myself this is unacceptable because I eat fructose and mercury is poisonous. I wish they would bring it down to a reasonable level or better yet find a new way of distilling fructose that is as economical as the Castner-Kellner process."""
0;"""Product was advertised as Porcini Powder.  The product that we received was labelled 'Dried Mushroom Powder.' It looked greyish rather than the richer cinnamon-brown color of porcini powders that I have purchased in the past from another company.  More importantly"
0;These should have an age limit. I do not think that breast fed babies under one should be allowed to eat these. Babies do not need probiotics at such a young age. My daughter ate about 5 of these and a couple of hours later projectile vomited all over the place! She does not spit up ever. I wished that I would have bought just one bag of these before I bought a whole lot of them!<br /><br />I think she will like them when she is a little older and used to eating other foods. She is mostly breast fed and eats some solids.
0;"""I am always looking for new cereal products.  I usually stay away from Kelloggs as my first thought of their products is sugary cereals that mess up glucose levels.  I am very disappointed Kellogg's FiberPlus Berry Yogurt Crunch cereal.  First it tastes similar to Sugar Frosted Flakes....way too sweet. Second"
0;"""<span class= tiny > Length:: 0:32 Mins<br /><br /></span>I have been on the coconut water wagon for over 2 years now.  I truly feel there is no better coconut water than the one that comes directly from the source in hand.  Because fresh coconuts are not easy to find I started buying Vita Coco over a year ago.  From all other coconut waters out there I felt theirs was the best tasting"
0;"""I have been drinking coconut water for a couple of years and I got my father drinking it by going on the Subscribe & Save program and shipping this to him. I finally cancelled it because at least 2 of the containers would be leaking"
0;I LOVE coconut water.  I drink it every day.  This is the worst kind.  It just doesn't taste right at all.  Amy and Brians or ONE are much better.  Even the cheap Tasco brand is better than this.  Do not buy this... please Amazon start carrying Amy and Brians or try to keep ONE in stock.  They keep putting this on sale because its NOT GOOD!
0;"""Do you know those Tootsie Pop commercials where they'd see how many times the Tootsie Pop could be licked before they'd chew right into it?  That's how this Likety Stik worked with my dog.  He licked it three or four times"
0;"""This is the strangest thing I've ever seen.  Imagine your roll on deodorant container  being filled with some bacon flavored  gravy and then allowing your dog to lick from it for his daily treat!  Are you kidding me?  This idea is gross and unsanitary and how do you get a dog to understand the concept that they are only supposed to take a few licks and that's their treat.  My dog kept trying to grab the container"
0;"""I decided to try this  treat  with my new dog. I am trying to teach her different responses and thought that a treat that did not add calories to her diet would be a good idea.<br /><br />I introduced the treat to her and she ignored it at the beginning. The shape of the container is of one of the old fashioned roll-on deodorants. I moved the ball around to get some of the liquid on it and re-introduced it to my dog. She liked the flavor but was frustrated with it as the ball gets stuck. She tried a few times and ended up yanking the container from my hand and running away with it.<br /><br />She is a very fast dog and when I caught up with her she had managed to rip the ball of the container. Lucky for me she did not swallow the ball as I think it could have killed her. I picked up the ball and threw it away. I could not get container from her as she was busy using it as a chew toy.<br /><br />I will not be buying this product for her as it is hard to use and I do not think that she should be chewing on plastic. The contents were delicious to her as they were a chicken based.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product."""
0;"""Well when I ordered this product for my dogs I had high hopes that this would be something that they might like.  The concept is that the product looks like a deodorant roll on...if you remember those.  You take the top off"
0;"""This product should have more explicit warnings on the packaging. My husband and I bought this as a treat for our 55 lb Doberman/Boxer mix. He loved the flavor and it served as a great distraction if we wanted to clean his ears or trim his dew claws. Unfortunately"
0;I was recommended this for my 15 pound rescue dog and her ongoing training.I initially loved the product...till she clamped down on the neck of the bottle sending the small down (roller) down her throat...I was very very lucky as I administered Peroxide immediately and she brought back up after 5 minutes...but please be aware that this can be dangerous
0;"""I was excited to get the Lickety Stik for my dogs. It sounds like a good idea BUT the roller part DOES NOT roll and in order for the dog to get something to taste you must squeeze the container which can be a mess. I have four dogs"
0;"""My two dogs apparently loved the scent and taste based on the way they were all over the Stik as soon as I uncapped it. The problem was the roller ball. It didn't roll very well. This became the pattern -- place thumb on ball"
0;I've been noticing recently that this and all their chunky soups are becoming more and more watered down.<br /><br />That and the incremental downsizing of their products(as with just about everything else in the grocery store) means I'll be passing their section of the soup aisle. Time to make my own I guess.
0;It is my own fault that I didn't realize I always buy the 18.8 ounce and this is only 10.75 ounce cans. (I've never even seen them in this small of a size). I only buy them on sale so the price per can for the 10.75 ounce is more than I normally buy the 18.8 ounce for.  Amazon will not allow you to return food even though this is cans and was still in the plastic wrap.
0;"""I purchased 8 jars based on reviews I read.  I was very disappointed in the quality of the ginger compared to what I get in restaurants and what I buy at the store.  The ginger was much thicker that what I considered normal and not the  pink  color I was expecting.  The taste also was not what I consider to be  premium .  Maybe I just got a sub standard batch"
0;"""The grains I got didn't look like the one you see on the pic. The one I got had to come from Antarctida bec they were yellow (probably they were frozen before)they also not growing...the amount I got was invisible to my eyes"
0;"""This is my first experience ordering kefir grains and growing them.  It seemed to me that<br />the shipping and handling charge were rather high for such a small amount (size of a<br />walnut or less.)  Also the directions should have come with the grains - not 6 days later<br />via email. Why so much later?  By then I had already handled them following directions<br />from my son who had recommended a source for them.  So"
0;I am really dissapointed with the product. I received less than half a teaspoon. I has been really hard to make then to work. I've had kefir pearls before. I know how to take care of them. I would not reccomend this seller. Try a different one.
0;I don't know if I'm doing it wrong or if the kefir grains I have are not any good. I've had the milk grains for about 3 weeks and I'm following the directions exactly. The grains are actually growing but every batch that I've made has that rotten sour milk taste.  Any tips that anybody might have that could save this batch or do I just chuck these and start a new?  The water grains I got you are doing great.
0;"""The actual product is fine.  It's recommended by my vet and I gobble it up daily.  I prefer my owner's food but she's stingy with it so I have no choice.  I even enjoy it at times.  My human was thrilled to order it in Feb 2009 and have it show up on our doorstep (no hauling of heavy bag in and out of car) and it was actually slightly cheaper than if she'd bought it from our local pet megalomart chain store.  I don't like the megalomart all that much.  The floors are slippery and they make my nervous.  But then again"
0;"""I am pretty upset about the recent pricing change on this product. I have been buying this for years and have had this on S&S for sometime.  My S&S was recently cancelled by Amazon at the same time it was suppose to ship (hence i ran out of Olive Oil).  I went on to re-order the product and thought at the time it was cancelled due to Amazon Frustration Free Packaging (yes I should have paid closer attention to the ounces when re-bought)however to my dismay when opening the package today the tins were HALF the size than the old ones.  So basically I am thinking ok - I wont be buying this brand again"
0;This food worked great for my two dogs up until about a year ago. Something changed in this food which caused both dogs severe diarrhea. Trialing them off and then on this food again caused the problems to return. We switched to a different brand.
0;I have two dogs that eat this food.  Both got very sick off of it.  The company offers a coupon or a refund for the bag of food.  What about the $500 worth of vet bills I had to pay because my dogs ate this food????  I will never ever buy this brand again and would not recommend it.
0;"""Let me preface this by saying I LOVE AMAZON. They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.<br /><br />I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the  voluntary  recall came out in April of 2012"
0;I could certainly go on for more than 20 words about how much I hated this coffee.  Fortunately I didn't pay for it because it came with my machine as a sampler.  Yuck!  It doesn't taste like good coffee and it doesn't taste like French Vanilla.  Point blank I couldn't even finish the cup and had to pour it down the drain.  The aftertaste is even worse.  I don't understand how anyone could give this a positive review but I guess it's all a matter of individual preference.
0;"""I love French vanilla coffee and was looking forward to this. It turned out to be a huge disappointment because all I could taste was the milk I put in the coffee.<br /><br />When you read reviews of the Keurig coffee makers"
0;"""I had a German Shepherd puppy who had frequent diarrhea. Giardia and fecal tests at the Vet's always come up negative. I noticed that she had diarrhea whenever I fed her canned food. Since HS is a good brand and there are no recalls"
0;"""Nespresso capsules have a domed bottom.  These are flat bottomed and absolutely will not work in newer Nespresso machines (after 2010 I think).  If the capsules for your Nespresso machines has a domed bottom"
0;"""I recently purchased these capsules because some of the reviews were positive.  I was excited to order them so I can use my own real Italian espresso beans.  Nespresso does not quite understand the consumer yet.  The consumer wants options not restrictions on having to order nespresso coffee only and very very limited where you can buy them.  So when I saw these capsules"
0;"""this is a comment and review of the Ne-Cap Nespresso Compatible Refillable Capsules for Machines Before and After 2010.<br /><br />This product is the most dissapointing item ever purchased from Amazon. The seller and Amazon have no responsibility in this matter but you as a customer must know this product is VERY POORLY DESIGNED AND SOLD WITH UNREAL EXPECTIONS. I am fooled once in a while but If you wish to purchase something that is very hard to handle"
0;I do not know  how anyone can get these to make a cup of anything. They are not made for Nespresso le Cube Thats for certain. It's unfortunate the company wastes peoples time with this. They probably assume most people will not spend the time and money to return these. The cups are visibly not as long and therefore do not get holes punched at both ends like the original. Maybe some machines they work but the company would do a service to potential  customers by not wasting everyones time and letting people know they do not work on the Le Cube at least. It doesn't even deserve 1 star but Amazon requires a star to be put to review.
0;This is a waste of money & the machine is a waste of money.  I got all this as a gift.  If the makers weren't ripoff artists they would have made  it easy to put your own coffee in...like Keurig did.  This product is just a lot of marketing hype.  Not even remotely worth the money.
0;"""Bad tasting. Smelled bad in bottle and tasted bad on popcorn...even after salting. If you want calories and bad taste ! Please order this product. I tried it several times thinking I did something wrong"
0;Took a chance on these. AWFUL! I know Starbucks is known for burnt tasting coffee but this is ridiculous. I actually like their in-store brewed coffees. Never tasted coffee THIS burnt before. Try Green Mountain Barista Prima (French Roast is da bomb!). A gazillion times better this stuff.
0;I bought these for my daughter's birthday.  She was excited at first but her favorite princess is Sleeping Beauty and there were not any in the entire box.  Seriously?  They can't ensure that there is at least 1 of each princess?
0;"""This is the WORST coffee I have had in years.  Either they do not know what French Roast is or someone really messed up.  I put cream in my coffee so at least I can taste that.  Avoid this brew! Does not deserve any  Stars  because it cannot be coffee."""
0;"""This is without a doubt the worst coffee I ever tasted!  The only reason I ever tried a box of this coffee is that the  wonderful  people at Amazon canceled my subscribe and save item of Diedrich french roast.This coffee even smells horrible right out of the box."""
0;"""I tried it when it arrived and did not like it. I tried to send the other unopened bags back but that request was was denied by Amazon. I tried to drink it when we ran out of our reg k-cups and we waiting on the new delivery"
0;"""Do Not Buy!<br />I bought this case of 12 bottles 2 months ago and have consumed a few of them. At first I noticed that the bottle looked different than the ones I've seen before. The bottles are opaque instead of the clear plastic I have seen in the past and is pictured. Secondly I thought the taste wasn't as strong as I had remembered but I didn't have any other mustard to compare it to. The more I used it the more convinced I became that it was not truly Grey Poupon since it just tasted like cheap dijon mustard to me. At Christmas I received a jar of real Grey Poupon and compared the two"
0;I like the idea like most people and saw many good reviews to believe that the coffee will actually taste good.<br />Nope. The taste is terrible and no aroma. The quality of the coffee bean selection need to be improved.<br />Disappointed with my first try of  san francisco bay kcup coffee.
0;"""When I first got the pods I loved them but after a couple of weeks in opened or unopened packages these pods must have lost their freshness because the coffee does is just not the same and it's pretty much awful at this point"
0;This coffee is very stale tasting and gives off no good aroma.  I thought I would be getting a strong coffee because of the name!  Instead it is very weak.  I can't return it so in the garbage it will go or maybe sell it at my next garage sale.
0;"""The cups are smaller and hold less coffee than the competitors. They also are not airtight so will degrade once the package is opened unless used quickly.  But even if used quickly they are weak and watery.  Actually"
0;I wish Amazon would include a list of ingredients on baby food in bulk. This has cream in it and my baby has a cow's milk intolerance. I had already opened the jar when I read the ingredients and now I'm stuck with 15 jars of food I can't use. So disappointing.
0;I purchased this sauce at a local grocery store this afternoon. I opened it and gave it a quick taste. Absolutely no flavor to be realized . I don't know why a company would put out such a bland product when spices to repair the taste are readily available. This is a bad product. Buy something else.
0;The first thing I noticed was an odd smell. That dissipated after a half hour or so. Off to a bad start. But I was willing to try one. It was sticky. The wrappers clearly had a layer of the cream filling all over the outsides.<br />In fact half of them were sticky. There was the source of the smell. There is no indication any of them were damaged and leaked that might have caused the stickiness. There are three levels separated by a sheet of cardboard but no stickiness on the cardboard. Because of all that they were sticky before they were put into the box.<br />Never again.
0;"""i have put more than a few gingerbread houses together with my kids and this was buy far the worst experience i have EVER had with one. do not waste your money on this pile of garbage. they use the Barbie name to draw you in and then nothing fits together"
0;One star is too generous. I love the tea and hate the seller. I ordered 6 packs of twining tea. The first seller I chose had a 6 pack and each pack with 20 bags. The next search was for the same deal and it even listed as a 6 pack. Now that I got the package I see it's one lousy box of 20 bags for more than $19. What an incredible rip off. Last time for Shaqdis Books and Marketplace for me.
0;The food is great and convenient to get it in an assorted pack but 18 pack means 9 PACKS OF 2. This is not a good deal and you can get these items for less as an individual purchase from almost any store.
0;i was expecting this product to be like the picture and come in a small beer stein mug but it was plain jars of mustard. the mustard is fine but the picture is deceiving and i was buying the product for the glass beer stein as a present. not was i wanted.
0;"""I'd like to make it clear that I really like pistachios. I eat a lot of this particular nut but these Setton Farms pistachios were beyond bad. There was a large percentage of nuts which were hard as rocks. The nuts which I could actually bite into tasted rotten. Also there were more empty shells than in any purchase I have ever made. I decided to check the expiration date and found that the date is not printed on the bag"
0;These giant gummy bears are horrendous! They taste like ****! They smell just as bad! Note in the picture that the blue raspberry bear is GREEN! I only made it a couple of bites into my blue raspberry one. My husband thought it was awful too.
0;"""i got these in the mail the other day and they are horrible. it is like they took Pink slime and seasoned it and piped it into thin plastic.<br />i am very disappointed :-(.  these are a step above a dog treat.  i hate to leave a negative review"
0;I'm always hesitant to write a negative review because tastes are different but with this product I felt I had a duty to alert consumers.  I bought this and out of the box it was pretty until I looked close and found it was infested with tiny white bugs that clung to nearly every branch and leaf.  I hoped they would die on their own but after three weeks they were still there and the plant itself had started to die.  I bought plant insect spray and they killed the bugs.  The plant died two weeks later.  I was very disappointed since I'd always wanted a bonsai tree and gardenia is my favorite scent.
0;This gardenia tree looked so cute online and we love gardenias. It arrived with a note to hurry and purchase a tray to go under the pretty pot which has 2 draining holes. It was a surprise this was not included. The plant did however come complete with ectoparasites (something like green scales clinging to the branches) and white flies. It was also not as mature as shown in photo - more like 3 branches with scant green and yellow leaves.
0;Just got this as a gift and it tastes like it's sold by junior highers to make money (like wrapping paper). it's not chocolate as much as it's cheap waxy choco-flavored covering a ball of sugar and lard. Do not buy this. Disgusting product. Don't be tricked.
0;The outer layer of the cookie is good but the center is far from creamy. It's rock hard and inedible IMO. I bought these and after eating a couple they sat in our pantry until they went stale and were tossed. I won't buy these again. However MI-DEL makes other cookie varieties that are delicious--my whole family loves the GF arrowroot animal cookies and the GF ginger snaps.
0;"""We buy this type of product because of a health condition. We ordered these cookies fully expecting them to arrive in a some what good condition. Instead all we received was crumbs and partial cookies"
0;"""These cookies were AWFUL!  Really bad.  My co-worker and I each bit into one and we couldn't finish it.  I tried one a week or so later when I was really hungry and it was still terrible.  Not only do they not taste good"
0;I am sorry to say this product does not live up to its positive reviews that are listed.  Lipton makes better ice tea products.  The worst part about this product is you can NOT get a refund or even a credit.  Once you have bought it.... it is yours!  I did not like the taste or brewing instructions. Amazon obviously knows something I didn't about this product......Probably explains why there isn't any recourse......or refund.....
0;"""This package of six boxes of forty eight bags per box is listed in the area of large tea bags suitable for making a gallon at a time of tea.  In fact it is just small single use bags.  The box and web page says  family size  bags.  There is nothing family sized about single use bags.<br />This is a bad advertisement and you should not buy them.  Read these misleading ads carefully.<br />I hope this company will go out of business."""
0;I have purchased this tea before and just love it but my latest purchase have inferior bags.  They break no matter how carefully you place them into the hot water or pour over.  The former bags were not the flow thru type and never broke.  These flow thru bags are very thin and cheaply made.  The tea still tastes great.
0;"""These waffles tasted  blah . The  waffle  part was more like a bad cookie and the chocolate is sub par.  I was very hopeful that these would be good and some what healthy as the package says no sugar. It's high calorie for a  cookie  and terrible tasting. I will not purchase again."""
0;Unfortunately the product is packed in a box that is not substantial enough to protect the crackers from breaking in transit.  Only about half of the crackers in each package remain in tact.  The cost is a really good deal as long as you don't need the crackers to be in tact.
0;Save your money.<br />Go buy yellow or white popcorn from your local grocery store (under a $1.00 a lb.).<br />They are charging $4.80 a pound here.<br />I found two of the three verities they are selling here are no more than yellow and white popcorn which cost less than $1.00 a lb. at your local grocery store.<br />Their third verity here the 'Purple' has no significant different taste or flavor than yellow or white popcorn.<br />Popcorn is popcorn after being popped.<br />Also save your money on their caramel topping. You are just buying brown sugar.<br />They are charging ($11.58) for a 10 oz. jar of what amounts to brown sugar.<br />A 2 lb. bag of brown sugar is around $2.00 at your local grocery store.<br />By the way brown sugar a very good popcorn topping in my opinion.  As good as I have found.<br />So there you are.<br />My opinion for what it's worth.
0;When I bought my popcorn popper I figured I'd try this popcorn just to see how it was.  Please dont waste your money on this stuff.  The colonels were very very small and tough.  I thought maybe since it was my first time using it  wud try it again in case it was me with a new popper....and again it was awful.  Threw the popped popcorn out and even the birds wudnt eat it....

0;I didnt realize the return date had just expired otherwise I would be returning these which I dont normally do. I was expecting these grains to make fizzy water and all I am getting is vinegarish water.
0;These lupinis I got through Amazon were soaking in a cloudy white fluid.  I've gotten the identical brand locally and it has always been clear.  I didn't want to chance eating these since I know bad batches can contain botulism.

0;"""Got some of this at wally world ...maybe it was old or something but it was awful....bitter...useless....i threw it out...this price here is ridiculous... NOT RECOMONDED !!!! One reason I did buy it was because it was not in a clear bottle"
0;I brought this for my husband and he said that it did not work at all and he tried it both of the ways that it said to now trying to return it and find that it is not that easy to return things will remember that when I think about ordering on here again
0;No aroma and tasted like cigarette ash. I think the beans were rancid when I received them since they were so close to the expiration date. Beware of low price because you get what you pay for. Old beans!
0;"""When I gave this to my dog he instantly went to town. As I sat and watched him I noticed the white t-rex had cut my dog's mouth from the sharp edges. He is an aggressive chewer and didn't want to see it go"
0;Bought this because it said durable and my dog uses other nylabones and I've had luck with them lasting me a short while. This wasn't the case she had the head and tail chewed off before I knew it. In less than an hour it was missing both ends. I'll have to go back to the wishbone because she takes longer to wear those down. Keep in mine my dog is a very strong chewer she can destroy things quickly so if your dog isn't a hard core chewer it might be ok for you but otherwise try something without small ends.<br /><br />EDIT- Just got worse had to call the vet due to bloody stool and this is the only thing I can think of that caused it
0;These cookies were stale. At least half the foil packets were slightly open and broken in a million small pieces. I love this brand of cookie but the orange essence flavor isn't available where I buy them so decided to order these online. My advice is stick to buying them from local source.
0;"""These were selling in my gym and I decided to try this and the Caraeml (which I reviewed separately and gave two stars).<br /><br />I managed to eat two bites of the caramel. I spat out the first bite of this one. It tastes disgusting. Furthermore"

0;"""1-800-flowers.com RUINED A 90TH BIRTHDAY gift!! I ordered flowers on Tuesday for a Friday delivery for Mom's 90th birthday party.  Due to health issues my husband and I were unable to travel so we ordered a flower arrangement that was made to look like a birthday cake with candles.  The ad listed the flowers as available for next day delivery so I assumed that meant something like this was kept on hand.  I ordered the arrangement 3 days in advance just to make sure (or so I thought) they would be there!  I looked at several flower sites and we liked the colors and flowers of this arrangement the best.  My brothers and sisters were giving Mom a party at the apartment complex where she lives so since we couldn't be there I thought this would at least let them know we were there in spirit.  I got a call Friday afternoon from customer service telling me the flowers could not be delivered.  They said they could delivery some flowers Saturday"
0;"""I bought these wipes a month ago and used them every day for a week before tossing them in the trash.  We live in a wooded environment and there are areas where water stands for awhile after it rains.  Mosquito's are everywhere and our only break from them is during the Winter season.  We've tried everything and the only two things that work for us are full coverage clothing and the dark green spray bottle of OFF Deep Woods Repellent.<br /><br />For these particular wipes"
0;The shipping was fast and the customer service was excellent. I was just very disappointed in the product itself. The product claims to give energy and reduce appetite yet after drinking the tea I never experienced a decrease in appetite or any energy. Wouldn't buy it again.
0;One can buy the same 32 oz Bottle from grocery store for $9.99 thus making a 6 bottle purchase to $59.64 even after paying sales tax it will be much less than $75.36 +shipping. I dont know why would someone buy it from Amazon.
0;This product description does not say whether this product is pasteurized. Alton Brown on Good Eats says that if pomegranate juice is pasteurized you lose a lot of the antioxidant benefits. I would likely change to more stars if it is not pasteurized.
0;I have never met a coffee creamer I couldn't stand until I tried this stuff. It's just horrible...the taste reminds me of how burned and melting plastic smells. I took 2 sips and I was absolutely disgusted. I threw my coffee out and brewed a fresh cup (skipping this awful creamer). I will NEVER buy this stuff again.
0;I'm afraid I must agree with most other on this.  This creamer is just awful.  It's like they pureed cardboard and added sugar.  I don't think the people that made it have ever had a white mocha before.
0;Does not taste like white chocolate at ALL! I just purchased this from the dairy section at walmart. It's terrible. Sucks because i bought a huge size thinking it would be good. hopefully i can return it. thought maybe it was just me since i am new to flavored creamers but i think the votes are in...stay away from this product.
0;"""This is by far the worst coffee creamer I have ever used. I was at the store and I decided to try a new creamer and I picked this one because I never had international delight before. But this gave my coffee a horrible taste"
0;I don't have to eat these to know it isn't good for those with wheat allergies or corn allergies. Bleached enriched WHEAT flour should not be in RICE noodles. Neither should modified corn starch. So if you have gluten allergies or are allergic to the most genetically modified plant on the earth - corn - then I highly suggest you steer clear from this!
0;"""I read the good reviews on Teeccino java herbal coffee so I went to my local Whole Foods to purchase it.  They only had Teeccino original light roast herbal coffee.

0;"""First I must say until recently I have never found a diet soda that actually tastes good enough to drink regularly. I was very excited to receive the Zevia All Natural Sodas because I have insulin resistance and I'm not supposed to have alot of sugar. I use the Truvia and Stevia sugar and I thought it would be a good idea to try the soda. I ended up giving the sodas away to a coworker and I'm sure my coworker threw them away. The taste is awful. The  coke  soda is way too sweet. The only flavors that I tried to convince myself that I could drink were grape"
0;Too pricy for what you get. I was expecting something delicious but unfortunately it's just a plain tortilla taste with a different look. You could get the same thing with any other brand name without having to pay a lot for it.
0;"""Ordered two packages.  Each was supposed to have four bags.  One package was opened and one bag was missing.  Whoever boxed the two packages must have been hungry and helped themselves to one.  In addition"
0;Make your own jerky and save money.  This product has MSG in it.  It's bad for you and unhealthy.  Just look on youtube how to make it yourself.  You don't need preservatives in your homemade jerky if you eat it within the week.
0;"""Bought this after reading all the favorable reviews. The pasta clumped into a massive ball when cooked according to directions. I tried unclumping and rinsing off the  slime  as it cooked. When I poured out my pasta what had been an entire pack had turned into about 1/2 cup. So much for a family meal that I could participate in without having to eat special food. I will never buy Heartland products again."""
0;"""Purchased these noodles when our family was put on a gluten free diet.  Thankful to find a alternative to wheat noodles I can not express my great disapointment.  The noodles became mushy and break down very badly.  While cooking a package for dinner I carefully watched and stirred the noodles as they shrunk in my pan.  In fear that there would not be enough noodles from this one package to feed my famiy of 4 (both of my children a small and do not eat large portions)  I put on a second pot and started cooking an additional bag of pasta.  By the time they were cooked and serve My husband and two chilren received a 1/4 cup of noodles and I received none.  They were gone it was like they shrank.  Not only were there not enough noodles"
0;These nuts were not fresh at all.  I'd give them 0 stars if I could.  I should have known given they sit in a warehouse till they get bought.  Definitely stay away from them.  I would have returned them but we opened them already.
0;These nuts arrived quickly and were well packaged however are very stale with no crunch. Our family of nut lovers will not touch them and they are just sitting while all the other nuts in the house are gone in a flash. A terrible waste!
0;"""Amazon sent the wrong product. Received regular Mars chocolate bars. Also had an expiration date which had expired.  I was really surprised that Amazon would ship expired food.  Amazon is in the process of sending me the Mars Bounty Coconut bars that I originally ordered. Hope I get the right order this time. I will let you know when it arrives if it is the right item. It seems their packaging recently has been really poor"
0;I love bounty and the one star is not for Bounty but for Amazon.<br />The first shipment they sent me had expired 2 months before.<br />The replacement shipment I got though it didn't expire till 11-11-2011
0;"""I just bought the Zebra flavor after sampling at a holiday booth. The sample had chocolate drizzled on each piece.  False representation. The actual bag contains few pieces with chocolate.

0;Purchased this at a local grocery store because we ran out of regular dog food. Our dog refuses to eat this food. Not really sure why. He would rather starve and drink water than consider eating this food.
0;"""I am German but have lived in the United States for almost 13 years now. It truly pains me to see what Haribo has decided to sell here in the US under the  Gold-Bears  brand. Anyone who has ever tasted the real thing will know immediately how fake these are - by simply looking at them!<br />You can tell right away that their German tagline  No artificial flavors or colors  does NOT apply here.<br /><br />Imported from Turkey? If you're going to ship all the way from over there"
0;These bears were not fresh at all.  They actually were melted all together when I got them.  I contacted Amazon and they promptly took care of the problem.  I do not recommend this product but highly recommend Amazon.
0;The shipment came quick enough but the Gummi Bears were all melted together in one big glob.  Wasted a lot of money and the Gummi's were for a party I was throwing.  SO I had to run out to an outlet mall to get them.

0;"""My 5.5 yr old son LOVES apricots and sweet potatoes so I was excited to try this flavor. I tried a sample package sold at Target and it tasted pretty good so I ordered a bunch online.

I now wonder if they changed the recipe"
0;"""I bought this for my 15 month old son who has become a VERY picky eater.  I wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and vegetable servings each day.  This does NOT do the trick!  He took one suck"
0;"""My 2 year old daughter loves these sort of squeeze pouches so I ordered a whole case of these thinking that I could sneak some veggies in. Unfortunately this is not the case. These are so sour that she shudders after taking a sip!  So just says  don't like it!  and wants the plain mango one. Curious"
0;"""I feel mislead by the name of this product as the ingredient list on the package lists pears first then peas and then broccoli. When I tasted it myself I realized why my daughter was enjoying it so much"
0;I am in love with this sugar-free Chai. However I will still trek to Walmart or other large retailer to purchase it for about $3/32oz container. This online retailer must be insane if they think people should pay this price. Make the trek folks!

0;I received my first box and when I opened it the chocolate had been melted. It was no longer smooth and creamy as Lindt truffles usually are. The weather had been cold and I accepted the package directly from the post women so I assumed it had arrived that way. I called Amazon and they gave me a replacement box which arrived in 2 days. Unfortunately it had also been melted and at that point I just gave up. I have two boxes of yucky chocolate.  I'm assuming that they melted while they sat around at amazon or Lindt provided a sub par product.  Do not order these. Buy them somewhere where you can inspect them first.
0;I was furious when I found out the ingredients listed on the webpage are different from the product's true ingredients and it is  way different!  ASPARTAME is in this product and YUCK YUCK YUCK. I am so sorry I ordered this and even sorrier I believed the Amazon webpage. I wish they would correct this!
0;I got 100 bags at Sams Club for 16$......only hours after I placed this order for 62 bags at 42$ish. No way to cancel...next time I will pay closer attention to the fine print. Bottom line...these were. 56 per bag compared to Sams@ .18 per bag. Its hard to find multiple same chip bags do I just went for it. Haste makes waste.
0;I'm an avid gum chewing person who has been trying to switch over to natural sugar free gum.  Initially I purchased this product due to the price being cheaper than it's main competitor spry.  What a mistake that was.  Actually this product is no cheaper after you spend 4.99 on shipping and also count in the additional time you have to wait for the product (4 -5 days) to be delivered.  The product tastes great initially but after about 5 minutes of chewing it tastes like crap. It leaves a very nasty after taste in your mouth. I'm forcing myself to chew it so I don't feel like I've wasted my money but it's not worth it.  The Spry gum tastes soooooo much better and it lasts.  Also I've tasted the variety of Spry flavors and they are all good.  So my final recommendation is to save your money on this product if taste matters. If it doesn't matter and cleaning you teeth is the key issue then go right ahead and torture yourself.
0;This treat has given my 120 pound doberman seizures and diarrhea badly. He is shaking all over and can barely walk as his hind legs are not wanting to stand. The muscles keep contracting. He finally vomited a lot of the bone.<br />I fed him one small busy bone. How can a company allow this to be sold?????????????<br /><br />The chemicals and colors in this treat are off the chart. PLEASE DO NOT FEED THIS TO YOUR DOG. I HAVE REPORTED IT TO PURINA AND THE FDA
0;"""I did not purchase this juice here at Amazon.Com as it is 51.00 and Walmart had the identical product for 15.00. (NOTE:) Right after I wrote this review I contacted Walmart with my review- they chose not to print any part of my review"
0;"""Coffee People has always been my favorite brand of coffee.  This is probably because I prefer bold and full bodied coffees.  I was told by one of their employees  their secret is they use 30% - 40% more coffee than the competition.  Since they were acquired by Green Mountain Coffee"
0;The picture made it look much better and bigger. Definitely not worth the money. I should have gone and bought my own and could have made a similar box. Although my sister liked it I was very disappointed and wish I could at least get a partial refund. Advice to others: make your own they will never know!
0;I have bought this product for the last 18 months because it had no sugar and it was great for my toddler.  Well what a shock I had when the latest box I purchased said it now contains SUGAR too!!  The only organic cereal now out on the market with no added sugar or evaporated cane juice is Barbara's Organic Cereal o's.  Make a statement and do not buy this again!!  Very disappointed with Cascadian Farm...why ruin a perfectly good no-sugar cereal???
0;"""I'm looking for an oat cereal to feed a young child and was excited to see that General Mills offered an organic alternative to its well-known conventionally-made Cheerios.

0;"""These used to be our and our 9 mo. old daughter's favorite snack. Unfortunately the company changed the formula altering the flavor and the nutritional value - not for the better.

0;"""Who takes a sugarless product and suddenly adds sugar to it - without changing one speck of packaging (except the ingredients list and calorie content)?  Manipulative? Fraudulent? Stupid? Whatever the rationale"
0;I have never cared for sweetened cereal as I was not raised on it. When I found Purely O's a few years ago I was happy to have found a cereal that did not contain sugar or corn products which I need to avoid because of a corn allergy.  I had intended to buy another box today. I took the time to read the label to make sure that nothing had changed. I could not believe that the ingredient list now lists CORN!  I am so angry!  Purely O's were my go-to breakfast when I needed a something quick or was in the mood for cereal.  There is nothing that this  company makes that I can now eat.  When will these people learn humans aren't pigs! Everything in a supermarket should not contain corn!  If I had wanted corny oat cereal I would have bought Cheerios.
0;the product features section states bar is high in fiber and low in carbs.  it's actually just the opposite with only 1g of fiber and 30g-6g(fiber and alcohol sugar) for a total of 24g carbohydrate.  way high if your on the atkins diet.
0;"""I was so disappointed with this tea. i bought a box during lunchtime looking forward to a nice cup of tea in the afternoon. I made the cup and took a sip - YUCK. It tasted fishy to me but couldn't figure out why tea would taste fishy so I read the ingredients. I wish I had read them before - the second listed ingredient is an oil blend of tuna oil"

I love tea both hot and iced so I was quite excited to try this one...tea + Omega 3's...perfect.  I smelled the fishy smell before I even tasted the tea.  I did force myself to tast it and took about two sips then had to pour out the whole pitcher I had brewed.  It is quite fishy tasting.  Ridiculously so.  Glad I bought the box on sale so I don't feel bad about tossing it but it is so bad I can't even fathom making someone else go through the smell and tasting I just did."""

0;"""I cannot recommend this dog food.<br /><br />Why?  because it contains poultry by-product meal.  I never give my dogs any dog food that contain by-products.  By-products are essentially the left over beaks"
0;"""My bad - I got sucked in by the Chef Michael name. I know he is a famous chef so I thought he would have the integrity to only sell his name to a high quality product line. After reading the ingredient list I'm not so sure. Too much soy"
0;I thought for sure that our dog was going to inhale this food.  He will pretty much gobble up just about anything you put in front of him so I fully expected Chef Michael's Gilled Sirloin to be a hit with him especially after seeing so many reviews saying that their dog loved this food.  I was shocked when I gave it to our dog and after chewing the first bite he actually spit it out.  I tried getting him to eat more of it but he wasn't having it.  I guess there is something out there that he won't eat.
0;"""Beef might be listed as the first ingredient but that hardly makes it the main ingredient.  After reading the ingredients list this  food  seems to be mostly made up of various forms of soy.  I am not a fan of soy & with all the GMO crap being pushed on us"

0;"""The ingredients in this dog food contain soy and corn which have about the same nutritional value as sawdust. Don't be fooled by the fancy label or celebrity jerks who promote this food. Dogs are not meant to eat grain (a little oatmeal or brown rice is sometimes okay). Typical of Purina dog foods"
0;"""There are several independent sites online that provide critical reviews of various dog foods.  Chef Michael's consistently receives the lowest rating possible.<br /><br />The main problem with this food is the numerous poor-quality ingredients.  Unspecified animal fat?  This can be restaurant grease"
0;GROSS!!!  I really tried to like this..<br />so did my hubby and my son.  We all said YUCK!!!!!!!!<br />The men dumped half a pound of sugar in it and still hate it.<br /><br />They both said.. just eat coconut oil with cocoa powder and no sugar - same thing!
0;I have to say these taste really good but if you have any kind of environmental conscience then you can't help but feel guilty about the unnecessary individual packaging! Each thin is in it's own plastic wrapper and has a thin piece of paper attached. I just feel it's a bit rich when the companies website says 'Enjoy Nature' and they so obviously play on the nature conscious theme. They are tasty but there are other nice things out there so for this reason I won't buy them again.
0;"""The  chocolate  is definitely not dark chocolate or even milk chocolate. It's some kind of chocolate cream that just tastes like sugar. I was very disappointed by this fake chocolate. I'm unsure as to the quality of the granola as it's not very filling. Also you get just one thin per pack.<br /><br />I will stick to their Oats 'n Dark Chocolate bars in the future."""
0;This is my second time of ordering and it's the second time it leaks. A few packs broke. I left the packaging feedback last time but Amazon simply ignored my feedback. So disappointment and will certainly not buy again.
0;AWFUL AWFUL!  Did not taste like coconut at all....  Would not purchase again.  I was very disappointed in this product.  I read a review after I purchased this product that stated there was a bad batch--if mine wasn't a bad batch then the product just isn't good.
0;I try to make sure that the products I consume are not only good for me but pleasantly flavored.  I did not find Vita Coco to be the latter.  The water was slightly sour and it was a real chore for me to finish a 17 ounce container.  I had to brush my teeth after drinking it because the aftertaste was strong.<br /><br />I love almost all things coconut but Vita Coco's beverage is not one of my favorite coconut based products.  I know there are many that applaud the health benefits of this water and I know those benefits are great but this stuff has a terrible taste and I don't care how spectacular those benefits are.<br /><br />This product is produced in Brazil.
0;This product is bad. I ordered 3 cases of this without knowing about it and it turned out to be the worst coconut water I ever tasted. The water was sour and every single person i know who tasted this didnt like it. Amazon gave me an amazing customer service by refunding me the entire purchase price. Except for amazon's customer service do not get this.
0;"""I belong to  a part of India where coconut is part of our staple diet. After moving to the US I had almost given up on the thought of drinking coconut water everyday. Prohibitive costs and availability being the primary reasons. When I saw this deal"
0;"""I just love Vita Coco coconut water and have been buying it locally for several years---I like the mild flavour and love drinking it after a workout.

0;I have ordered VITA coconut water 17oz pack and the taste was pretty bad. Most of the bottles smell and taste stale. Couple of the bottles were decent but not as good as ZICO or ONE. I have tasted ONE and ZICO coconut water before and they taste pretty much the same and I like them a lot. So I am going to stick with these two brands for now.
0;"""I love the Vita Coco coconut water. Have been ordering it for a while now (atleast 3 - 12 packs a month).<br />Just received this shipment with a very sour taste. Poured it out into a glass and it looked brown"
0;I had this brand before a few years ago.  I don't know what they have done be it the packaging it is in or what.  But this taste like crap.  I only bought this because I remember in the past it taste good but this is awful.  I bought the case based on the past experience and I wish that I hadn't.
0;"""I bought a box of 12 the other day after reading the mostly positive reviews...ive had real coconut water from brazil and this is not the same at all.. it says 100% pure but it tastes like it has a bunch of chemicals in it..i havent tried the flavored but this one although it has 230% vitamin c and more pottasium than 2 bananas"
0;My dog loves these bones so much.  He is a big dog and is a big chewer.  He can't wait to get to it in the morning - outside.  It's a bit stinky for inside.  It keeps hime busy for a long time each day.
0;I love this stuff but $6+ for one container is rediculous.  Save yourself some cash by purchasing one of the other Sugar Free flavors (6 pack) and just add a bit of coco powder to the container of Coffee Mate powder and shake a few times.  Almost Perfect and much less cash spent.
0;"""Should not even be one star! These bars are at best factory seconds - not to mention stale.  Even though the expiration date stamped on the box is still good - the bars are not edible.  I have been eating these bars from my local store for over a year and really enjoy them!  I am exceptionally disappointed because they are one of the few  gluten  free bars out there.  Find a new vendor."""
0;i was so upset i used to be able to order these as a super saver but when i order the box i opened it and all bars have turned white and broke apart It must have been from an old stock.  They used to be my favorite so dissappointed. dol<br />think thin brownie
0;"""The brownie one tastes good. The problem is the severe GI  discomfort  (to be polite) that follows a few hours later.  I know it wasn't coincidence because I tried it 3 different times on random days when I felt fine otherwise.  Ex-lax doesn't work as well or as fast as these!  Have a thinkThin bar"
0;"""I eat one of these a day and I love them. I decided to order off of Amazon because of free shipping. The entire box is totally stale!!!! I know what fresh ones taste like and these are discolored and gross. I can't eat them"
0;"""I was expecting these to be tasty after reading the other reviews.  Wow- they are horrible.  I tried several hoping maybe a different one would be better on a different day- but no luck.  They are just bad- the flavor"
0;"""I decided to buy one of these in the grocery store before buying a case and I'm glad I did! I got through two bites of this disgusting 'brownie' before tossing the rest of the $2.00 bar in the garbage.<br /><br />I'm not going to waste my 'treat' on something that tastes of a mixture of cardboard and chemicals. Whether or not there ARE any chemicals in these bars is irrelevant. If it tastes like it"
0;These bars are disgusting. After trying the company's ThinkOrganic bars I wanted to give some other products from them a try. These bars do not taste anything like a brownie. They taste like diet food. yuck yuck yuck. disgusting.
0;"""I am surprised at the rave reviews for Bac'Uns. I thought the flavor was really nasty. I haven't eaten pork in about 20 yrs but have been eating Bac-Os and occasionally the fake bacon strips from Morningstar Farms or their breakfast patties...those I like but wanted to switch to something without artificial ingredients"
0;When my husband brought in the delivered package with popcorn kernels stuck to the tape of the folded box and the sound of popcorn rolling around in the box... He knew what his Christmas surprise was immediately... a Popcorn Popper. The bag the popcorn came in was not sealed properly on top and 2 inches of the bag was open leaving the popcorn stale and spilling all over.
0;"""I have to agree with one of the earlier reviews. This tastes like cardboard!<br /><br />I was a bit surprised by the taste and had to check if the box I had was within its expiry date. It was fine. So I slowly chewed a few pieces and found it hard to detect any real  taste  (it's hard to explain) and it just didn't taste like any food items I have eaten before. First thing that came to my mind was cardboard. Thankfully I only had one box. The texture was not like normal pasta so it's just whatever ingredients contained in it made into a pasta shape."""
0;"""This is mostly dry croutons with very little flavor. I need to try to find some way to salvage this mix as no one will eat it the way it is right now. I was expecting something more like Chex Party Mix"
0;These were shipped later than the Chocolate ones so I thought these couldn't be any worse than the chocolate...WRONG..These are horrible! Dry in your mouth and add any liquid..milk? coffee? and these turn to the consistancy of sawdust.  Truely disgusting..never again..Usually my products from Amazon are good..so I was really disappointed.
0;I have purchased Back to Nature Crispy Wheat Crackers consistently for a year.  We eat a case a week (6 boxes).  Also have the saltines on hand and graham crackers.  Received 2 cases of Crispy Wheat Crackers last week and opened them last night.  Every box of the 12 boxes I received were loaded with salt - more salt than ever.  They are so salty they burn your mouth.  You can feel the salt and see the salt.  This seems to be a manufacturing problem.  I have notified Back to Nature about the problem and we will see if they fix it.  In the meantime beware if you purchase the product that you may receive mostly salt and no cracker !!!!
0;I have three complains for this product!!<br />1.The distributor delivered out of date product.<br />2.They delivered 7 months out of date product.<br />3.The packet and the powder both are so ugly . They taste yack.<br /><br />I recommend please DO NOT buy this product. The distributes they don't care about the consumer's health . They just need money. They can delivery any product . I would prefer to give them minus rating.
0;"""For some reason I thought that you got three  pops  but you only get one.  For the price I paid for the Puff Pop and shipping it was just a little too much.  Everyone laughed at it and thought it was cool for a few days and then it was set aside and then misplaced.  Too pricey but cute item!"""
0;I lived in Renton Wa my whole life & loved eating at the Oberto stores... When I moved to Ma. a couple of years ago I was sad that I could not have my Oberto fix since its a West Coast product!!! I finally found it online & ordered it... The jerkey is nothing like it used to be... It said new on the packaging but same great taste... It was so gross my cats turned away!!! Hopefully the ter. pep. bites will be good!!!
0;"""I would say I get less salt from sucking on a handful of sunflower seeds. This was horrible. Despite what the package says this is not the original jerky. I would eat a bag a day back in 2005 and 2006"
0;"""Pro: It is probably close to the genuine article.  Real preserved beef slices.<br /><br />Con: It is really salty and it is not just from natural sodium chloride. It is full of preservative sodium.  It does not actually taste like a culinary creation.  It seems like chemically preserved salted beef.  It is so bad"
0;I like a variety of jerky but this Peppered style from Oh Boy! all I can say is Oh NO!!!!!! Thin sliced is OK but not when it is as dry as cardboard. I did not like this product at all. I don't usually do reviews but I felt I had to give my opinion on this one. I will NOT be buying this one again... Sorry Oh Boy! Oberto...
0;Reese's peanut butter eggs were delivered with chocolate melted.  Amazon should not sell chocolate items unless they can guarantee they will be delivered unmelted!! I will never buy anything with chocolate again!
0;was very disapointed with this purchase the expiration date was 2013 but the candy wasn't fresh the milk chocolate was white in color like it was old or had been exposed to warm temperatures opened all 4 bags and they were all the same would not recommend
0;This candy is definitely not Chick O Sticks. There isn't any coconut surrounding each piece. The candy I received was extremely hard with a very faint taste of peanuts. I would never recommend this candy.
0;It has a very bitter after taste and clumps up. I put it in my tea and found two lumps at the bottom of the cup when i finished. This is total garbage. If it was the first stevia i had tried I would be off stevia for good.
0;I heard all this talk about Eagle Pack so I gave in and checked it out but this is a food just a bad if not worse than Purina cats dont eat corn or corn gluten this is kitty candy the same a hersheys kisses to us or cereal but worse cause it will be what is given everyday sometimes all of the cats life I mean genetically our pet being cats and dogs can live into their late 20s it is proven but diet is key just as the worlds oldest people who live to 120 or 116 say they eat healthy like from their garden or organic foods not cereal animals are the same why are we killing a animal that existed before man.
0;I ordered tulips for my wife because they are her favorite flower.<br /><br />Instead of the 30 Multicolored tulips I ordered she receives a dozen roses. REALLY dont you think if I wanted to order a dozen roses I would have done that.<br /><br />Whats next AMAZON and Pro Flowers?!?!? Maybe you will substitute a flaming bag of dog excrement for my next order.<br /><br />So far today 2 of my three orders from you have been nothing like what I ordered. If I wanted a surprise package or a mystery gift I would have ordered that.<br /><br />I am disgusted with this shopping experience.<br /><br />EPIC FAIL!!!
0;"""I was so eager to try this dressing based upon the stellar review posted though my intuition and experience have taught me that when there is only one review to be cautious. I thought the Biltmore name might add some additional assurance"
0;"""We followed all the instructions and did not freeze the bread.  Once we opend a loaf we refrigerated it.  A day or two after opening a loaf the bread went moldy. This happened to two loaves.  Because of this I would not buy it again.  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK9XQ6 >Ener-G Brown Rice Loaf Gluten and Wheat Free -- 16 oz</a>"""
0;"""I got the plant in good shape however the the center bamboo and heart shapes started to turn pale and brown. I gifted it to wife who changed the water and washed stones very regularly. She even kept it in indirect sunlight when it was turning pale no use. Ultimately we have to cut the Heart shaped portions of bamboo"
0;I can't taste green tea nor ginseng in this tea bag.  I would recommend Lipton Honey Lemon Ginseng to someone who enjoy green tea and ginseng flavor and extra boost of energy.  Stay away from this product!  I would not buying this product again.
0;some things that are seafood shouldnt be edible especially this. its disgusting and has squirmy legs and every time i see one i think of the creepy lady from the little mermaid. who knows you could be eating ursula ??<br />The only reason you should eat octupus is if you are being dared or on Fear Factor. there are some things in this world you can't eat
0;"""FYI to anyone who loves their cat(s) and is feeding them this premium cat food thinking it is... Well it was just (very quietly) bought out by P&G. Either that means something to you or it doesn't. For me it was a deal breaker. Our cat loved this food"
0;"""I bought this food because it seemed like an excellent choice of food for my cats. I gradually switched from Eukanuba to Innova Evo about three months ago because I wanted to provide better nutrition for my cats. Three of the cats adjusted well to the new food"
0;Evo is the first bag of grain free kibble I picked up once I had both my kittens in the house in the fall of 2010. Neither one would touch it and neither would eat it when I tried to integrate it into existing kibble. I took the bag back to the store and got my money back. I've found many better quality grain free kibbles since my experience with Evo. I don't think P & G is responsible for my cats not liking the food. I bought before P & G announced they acquired Natura Pet. My cats just did not like it - neither of them did.
0;"""Ok I know how beneficial all the ingredients are in this dry food are. But my MAIN COMPLAINT is my cat (at least once a week) ends up pushing out STICKY POOP! He can't pinch the last bit off and it sticks to his butt and then he waltzes out into the living room and DRAGS HIS BUTT ON THE CARPET!!!!!!! Our healthy cat is a strictly indoor cat and he has all the access to water and is only fed this dry food by a Le Bistro automatic feeder. Don't tell me I have to supplement his dry food with wet food"
0;I bought this to use in my bread machine while deployed to Iraq. I never was able to get a good loaf. I even purchase fresh yeast. The yeast in the boxes turned out to be almost 2 years expired. I gave up. I'll eat bread when I get home.
0;"""I ordered this as a case of 40. I got 1 envelope. The customer service is in India and they don't understand much. They kept insisting that my one envelope was a case. Silly them. It took several phone calls over a couple of weeks since I placed the order and now I have my gatorade but it came in multiple flavors that I don't want and a different package size that I don't want. Cest la vie"
0;"""My cat loves him some shrimp.  Imagine his and my face when we opened the shrimp tube and saw shrimp dust.  Little guy couldn't eat the dust without inhaling or blowing.  Keep thy feline off the drugs and say no to this product"
0;"""I bought some of these from a vending machine at my work today. I want my quarter back. I tasted a red one. It tasted like how horse manure smells. I have no clue why they'd call these Lotsa Sours when they aren't sour in any way shape or form. I thought maybe one of the other flavors would be better. I was wrong. The green one had a slight hint of possibly a different fruit flavor"
0;"""I ordered these crackers because I love the taste of seaweed. You can see specks of it in the crackers but there is absolutely NO flavor of seaweed. These are very bland so they aren't too great on their own. However"
0;It is as yummy and nutritious as all the other reviews claim. You don't have to like Indian food to like this product and it does remind me of a good chile.<br />Regular price at Stop & Shop is $3.69. I thought that was expensive so I decided to look for it online. The price on Amazon and other online retailers is so ridiculously expensive that I'm going back to the supermarket to stock up just in case they priced it wrong.
0;"""I had just come back from NYC and had dilled green tomatoes.  I was craving this food.  I did research and this item seemed to be what I was looking for.<br /><br />The picture is misleading.  I got my package.  I was horrified.  I was expecting large"
0;I like strong coffee but was able to use the cup 3  times. Reminds me of Starbucks coffee. The cost is good but you really have to have a taste for very strong flavor. Asfar as ordering it again...NO. If you like strong coffee this will be a barginfor the cost because of making several cups of coffee from 1 k cup.
0;"""When I think of Chicken Pot Pie I drool over the chicken and vegetables and pie crust along with the delicious gravy.  Now take all that away and add FAT noodles instead.  That is what is in this terrible soup.....just fat noodles.  It does have a nice flavor but I soon realized that"
0;"""Puppy LOVES this food BUT the manufacturer has so far failed to take the steps necessary to eliminate BAD BAD Ethoxyquin used to preserve the fish meal ingredients from its suppliers. It is NOT necessary to use ethoxyquin to preserve fish meal"
0;THESE White rock candy demitasse sticks are a stained tea color and several sticks are broken.This is VERY DISSAPOINTING since I had ordered these several times in the past & they WERE WHITE and NEVER broken.
0;"""OK. I admit it. I didn't scrutinize the full product description nor study the picture of the bag before purchasing this product. I purchased this product thinking that it was 100% Kenya coffee. Nowhere in the product title or in my invoice did it say it was a Blend. You had to look at a closeup of the bag or read through the romance description in order to get an inkling. Even then"
0;"""Yuck!  The little fish taste like vinegar.  I like a mustard taste but the vinegar overpowers the mustard.  I was sent twelve boxes.  I rinsed them off with hot water to try to get rid of the sauce but the vinegar still hung on.  I choked them down"
0;"""I love General Foods International Chai Tea Latte and drink a lot of it.  It warms me up on cold winter days.  You can even put ice cubes in it and drink it as a cold drink in the summer.  Buying Chai Tea at the grocery store gets very expensive the way I drink it.  Buying Chai Tea in bulk helps me save money.  If I did not buy my Chai Tea from Amazon.com"
0;"""Fixed according to directions and served to a panel of 3 people.  0/3 liked it.  I'm a fan of Kraft mac-n-cheese and could eat a pound of steamed broccoli for dinner alone but the powdered broccoli's look"
0;We LOVE velveeta in our household but unfortunately today I opened a box of broccoli rotini and there was no cheese sauce or broccoli pouch. Usually I would just write this off as a mistake and forget about it but it's the second time this has happened to me in less than a month.  I don't have much use for a box of rotini noodles :(
0;"""I normally enjoy Velveeta macaroni and cheese and thought that I would give this a try. I am sorry that I did.<br /><br />The  pasta  in the product is the size of rice and not at all tasty. The  broccoli  consists of green"
0;This would have been OK or SO-SO if they had used regular pasta. I'm feel like the other reviewers that the broccoli was more of a dust than chunks. This also needs some meat like tuna or ground turkey. I would encourage shoppers to try the other velveeta skillets because they are really good. However this broccoli one was a total bomb.
0;One of the things I have always done sith Mac n Cheese is add veggies to it. I love the flavor of the cheese with veggies. One of the biggest complaints I have always had with frozen or boxed foods is the one piece of veggie they will put in a container for 4 and call it a dinner. Buy your own veggies and add it yourself. You will then get a complete serving of veggie.<br />I don't even know what they put in this box. It sure did not look or taste like broccoli. How and why do these companies get away with this?
0;"""I'm a big fan of the standard Velveeta shells and cheese so I thought this would be great for a fast week-night dinner.  WRONG!  Ended up throwing it down the garbage disposal and ordering pizza instead.  I wish I had read the reviews first"
0;Bought this product from our local Publix where it's often buy 1 get 1 free.<br />We ate it a couple of times and I must saw we did like the taste.<br /><br />One day I tore open the packaging when my son started crying. I went to him and left the packaging on the counter. I came back a minute later and my countertop was crawling with tiny little bugs that could have been mistaken for spices if they weren't moving! I emptied the back in a zip-loc and it was full of these little bugs crawling around. If I would of put the packaging directly in the water i'm sure the bugs would have died instantly in the water.<br /><br />I was completely disgusted and called the company. The woman on the line was completely unfazed saying it seemed that my product was contaminated and that these things happen! Happen to who?!!<br />She continued to say she could send me free boxes or some coupons if I would provide my address.<br />I informed her that the last thing I want is an other box of this stuff in my house and hung up.<br />DO NOT BUY!
0;We loved Zatarains pre-mixed jambalaya with sausage that you just warmed up and it was ready to eat. Absolutely delicious. This product has absolutely no resemblance in taste to that product whatsoever. It doesn't even hold a resemblance of taste to jambalaya in general. I made the mistake of buying a dozen boxes and they are all in the trash now. NEVER buy a Zatarains product again.
0;I need help here.  Just received the coffee and put it in my Keurig and won't brew.  Have to hold handle down to get it to brew?  ANy suggestions from the supplier would help?  I bought this as it says K=Cup and compatible with Keurig.  Can't even return it on Amazon.  HELP!!!!!!!
0;"""This product is made in Romania and Amazon has left this information out.  Word of warning this isn't the first Gluten Free product that this has happened to me on. It boiled up into a pot of paste suitable for making paper mache and not suitable for eating. I have tried using bigger pots with more water and still no luck. Also the cooking time is way off"
0;"""not what i expected.. I tried vanilla version at my neighbour's - they were soft and nice.. but they were also in a bigger bag (8 oz or so). These cookies (oatmeal) come in small pouches (2 oz or so) and they are stone hard"
0;"""I ordered the mix and match 60 item pack that was on sale expecting to get a decent size package and a reasonable value. Instead I got snacks that were priced at .25 per package suitable for vending machine use and of less face value than the purchase price. Even Amazon's free shipping can't offset the overpricing and if you order direct from UTZ the shipping doubles that overpriced amount.<br />Definitely not worth the price particularly when local retailers sell the same brand product at 4-5 times the size for under a dollar.<br />This multipack is in my opinion just UTZ's way of maximizing unwarranted profits from unknowing online customers. Seriously"
0;"""I had my dog on this food until he developed an infection in his anal glands. My vet told me not to use this food anymore because it is made in china and the glucosamine in the Happy Hips formula provides no benefit to my dog because the amount of glucosamine is too small and its not a high quality. He had us switch to Royal Canin<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00068K2OK >Royal Canin Dry Dog Food"
0;"""I saw that it actually has several good reviews but this was one of the most disgusting things I ever tasted. This was the first gluten free product I tried followed by a sandwich with brown rice bread. I thought I would end up starving because it all tasted like sawdust. I did make myself eat the whole cereal bar but it was horrible. I kept the box sitting on my desk because I hated to throw away a $5 box after eating one. Yesterday after them sitting on my desk for over 4 months I finally threw them in the trash yesterday. I was very sad & disappointed. I was looking for something quick"
0;Why would you want to buy seeds that are rubbing against a piece of colored printed paper that was obviously folded and inserted by someone. Organic seeds shouldn't have foreign substances in them period. Think about it. To tell you the truth they shouldn't even be in a plastic bag. Paper bags like the one's that Eden uses for their beans would be perfect. Plastic is nothing more than petroleum.
0;None of the asian super markets around me sell the old style anymore. I am so damn sad. This new bowl it comes in doesn't hold back the heat and is very hot to touch. The flavor is so damn bad. Bring back the old regular hot and spicy picante please... PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEE.
0;This is nothing like the any organic pumpkin I have ever purchased.  It is dry and hard when it comes out of the can.  It actually is affecting the stools of my dogs in a negative way.  Will never buy it again.  I will pay more for the good stuff.
0;I have read all the reviews. I don't think I will order The pumpkin for dogs.I can't trust cans that have dents and damaged. I love my pets to much to take a chance on their health .I will stick with human- grade pumpkin . Not pumpkin that is for dogs . Please people give me a break. That is just a way to make you think you are doing a good thing for your pet .It's second grade food.
0;"""I will admit that I overlooked the  For Dogs  part in the  tiny thumbnail picture but the title should include that important imformation. I bought this for my girlfriend and I and we are not dogs. The worst part is that this item is not eligible for returns."""
0;"""I am very disappointed with this purchase.  I don't think it is the product itself but rather how old the chips were that were shipped to me.  The first bag I opened were pretty good and I was feeling happy with my purchase. However"
0;Amazon's price on this is crazy. 12 bottles of 500 for over 40 dollars. I can get 6 bottles of 1000 the exact same thing for about 10 dollars cheaper just without using amazon. MAKE SURE AND DO A SEARCH AND PRICE COMPARE RATHER THAN PAYING AMAZONS RIP OFF PRICE.
0;"""I thought I would be economical and buy this 5lb jar. In our apt the dishwasher could use a boost and I heard (and read all the reviews)that a little bit of this added with dishwasher soap makes everything sparkle"
0;"""I believed that I was ordering small pieces which I could use in baking or cream cheese and ginger sandwiches.  The pieces are much too big for this purpose and they are not really crystallized ginger"
0;"""I have had hearing loss for many years.  I also have tenitis.  I have been taking Hear All & Stop Ring twice daily for almost 3 months.  I have seen no noticable difference whatsoever.

0;"""I was so looking forward to a nice cuppa of Earl Grey but I had no idea what I was in for when I brewed my first  pot of Davidson's organic Earl Grey tea. It was the worst cup of brown liquid I've ever put in my mouth and as my granddad used to say"
0;"""This is the worst tasting tea I have EVER had ..... it was very dry and flaked into powder when you but it in between your fingers.  Had a taste of come chemical that had to have been used in it's drying or production.  I have drank teas for many many years and after one cup through this way ... I also tried their english breakfast style.... and again way too dry and chemical taste in the tea ... DO NOT BUY THIS TEA .... thank goodness for Amazon's customer service department ... they sent me two new bags which were also bad and then refunded my moneis.....Again"
0;"""I normally buy Mee Chun fermented black beans from a local store (a tiny family run placed called  Nak's Oriental Market  in Menlo Park by Oak Grove). Those have a wonderful strong flavor and nice texture. I thought these would be similar. They are not. They are also NOT like in the photo.<br /><br />The photo makes them look just like Mee Chun beans"
0;"""I bought a box for wholefoods and was so excited to make tapioca pudding last night!  What a disappointment.<br /><br />Who ever created the back of the box is a total dimwit.  And shame on me for following them blindly.<br /><br />First of all"
0;"""I ordered SINF basmati rice and what arrived today is Nissan extra long grain rice.<br /><br />3 problems with the order:<br /><br />- what arrived is not the same as the product pictured above (not the SINF brand)<br />- this is not basmati rice"
0;This product deserves an even lower rating. The final product was extremely sugary for a teriyaki sauce. Flavor is a 0/5. It's nutritional value is also very lacking because they don't give you enough vegetables. It's only a morsel about the size of a 1/2 tablespoon. 0.5/5 for nutrition. The portion was also very small. 4 ounces + 1 cup of water makes a a very measly 12 ounce snack. 1/5 for nutrition. The fact that you have to microwave it for 4 minutes destroys many of the valuable nutrients compared to boiled noodles. 1/5 for texture.
0;I was very excited to purchase these antlers for my dogs. I am always searching for new natural yet different chew options for my dogs. I was very disappointed when the antlers lasted no more than 15 mins for each dogs. Maybe these are better for x-small to medium dogs.
0;I quit buying M&M's because of a price increase.I guess they figured they could charge an outrageous<br />amount in the stores like they do at the M&M factory in Las Vegas. Now I just relized they down sized their<br />hot fudge to 12 oz  it was 16 oz  and they are charging the same price as a 16 ounce jar!! ($1.96 at Wal-Mart)
0;The above delightful reviews are sadly recalling a different product. The Lea & Perrins that is sold in the US now uses high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar (which is what is still in the UK version.) This may not matter to some but it definitely detracts from the authentic clean spicy taste by making it more sickly sweet which the original is not. It really becomes apparent in Bloody Mary's and also in scrambled eggs or toasted cheese (Welsh Rarebit.) Bring a bottle back from the UK and compare the difference. A pity because it must mean only a cent or so difference in the manufacturing cost.
0;HFCS - High Fructose Corn Syrup - is processed differently by your body than sugar and is considerably worse. Do not trust the propaganda of the subsidized Big Ag in America for your truthful info on food.<br /><br />You can get an organic version from Annie's.
0;"""Not Genuine!  High Fructose Corn Syrup in this one.  You are buying a Heinz knock off.  For the Genuine sauce you need the one still made in England called  Original and Genuine.   See wikipedia for more info."""
0;I tried each salad dressings of walden farms and bleu cheese is one of the most unsavory ones that also ruins the taste of the salad. It tastes and smells like white glue. So I would suggest Coleslaw dressing which is great and can also be used for Caesar salad. French also tastes good for giving a spicy taste to the salad.
0;We are on the Ideal Protein diet and need dressings that have no calories. These fit the bill but are not edible. What a disappointment! Perhaps the other flavors are better but I thought that just about anyone could get Blu Cheese and Ranch dressing flavored right. Not so! They are awful.
0;Save yourself the money do NOT buy the Sobe Lifewater  Mango mandrian w/ coconut flavor- GAG.<br />Not that I know what a smelly arm pit tastes like but it would have to be very similar to this distgusting Sobe flavor.
0;"""I've bought all 3 brands of pitted country olives sold on Amazon.  These are my least favorite by far.  There is too much rosemary in them.  It detracts from the olive's flavor and all the rosemary  stems  make for an unpleasant eating experience.  I find myself reaching in my mouth to pull out the stems like when you have a hair in your mouth."""
0;"""I get the large bags for 3 dollars each at walmart.. 3.50 at stop and shop. This is selling them for about 5 dollars a bag.. um no thanks. LOVE these though and am very addicted to them!! buy them at target"
0;"""Very disapointed in this particular item. We also had the tenderloin and it was very good. We entertain several times a year and had hopes that Top Serloin was suitable for dinner guests but was sadly mistaken. We did however have the Tenderloin the next week with guests and it was  very  good."""
0;I hated even giving this product one star.  These are awful.  Do they not have a taste testing department in this company?  The chocolate pieces totally ruin the whole cereal.  They do taste like wax and get stuck to the top of your mouth when eating them.  Disgusting!
0;WHAT KIND OF CHOCOLATE FEELS WAXY AND IS HARD TO CHEW BECAUSE IT STICKS TO YOUR MOUTH. I DIDNT EXPECT THE CEREAL TO BE FABOULOUS BUT I ALSO DIDNT EXPECT THEM TO JUST THROW THIS MESS TOGETHER! WHEN ITS ALL SAID AND DONE I HAD A BUNCH OF CHOCOLATE PIECES IN THE BOTTOM OF MY BOWL....THE FLAKES ALONE WERE VERY YUMMY BUT THE CHOCOLATE SUCCCCCCCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;Terribly waxy chocolate pieces that all sunk to the bottom of the bowl while the flakes floated on top.  The flakes seem to have a chocolate flavoring added to enhance the experience but those disgusting chocolate pieces made me gag and I wondered what I was eating...!  Alone they were nearly tasteless and I'll never purchase again.  Yuck!
0;"""I purchased this product because I loved the fruit & yogurt version (which I will no longer purchase because it has partially hydrogenated oils).  All I can say is this cereal is gross!!  The chocolate is disgusting and after one bite I decided to throw the entire box away.  It also has partially hydrogenated oils"
0;"""This candy looked really interesting and I thought it was going to be tart or sour. What I didn't expect were little packets of lemon flavored salt. That's literally all this is. It shouldn't even be called candy :( If you are looking for popcorn seasoning this might not be so bad but to just pour into your mouth and eat"

0;"""I bought this product for a coctail party.  When it arrived most of the crackers were chipped or completely unusable to serve to guests.  I bought 2 boxes so it turned into a $25.00 mid-night snack.  If you have the opportunity to buy them in the grocery do so"
0;I have purchased this product many times during the last two years. They used to arrived in very good conditon. Dates were allways soft and juicy. This is the second time I receive them in bags without label. Fruits are dry and it is not a pleasure to eat them anymore. I am really very dissapointed
0;I ordered this product using subscribe and save and was sent the wrong flavor. I checked my order and confirmed that I ordered the unsweetened vanilla but was sent the original flavor. My daughter won't drink it!
0;"""I understood this product to be  single  server with the Solofill Cup.  It's not.  The cup won't hold the entire contents.  Too hard to measure out what's needed on a consistent basis.  Waste of money IMHO."""

0;"""I had to put in a review of this product after I read the previously entered 5 star reviews. I purchased some tonight at World Market and I must say that this is absolutely the worst tasting candy that I have ever come across. Believe me"
0;"""I received an email from Amazon promoting this item and since my husband loves them I went to the website.  Not reading all the detail I assumed I would get three boxes for $7.73.  They are around $3 a box at the grocery store.  So I ordered 2 thinking I would get 6 boxes - a good deal.  Not so"
0;I have two overweight cats and they were put on a high protein diet to lose weight. I was looking for a high protein cat food that I didn't have to purchase at the vet. My cats are not picky eaters and they hated it.  I had to wash the dishes before they would even consider eating another food out of them. My dog wouldn't even clean up the pieces that were on the floor. It is also crumbles very easily so there is a powder residue everywhere.
0;"""I have a 10 month old Weimaraner that loved the Regular Busy Bone Chewbone threat so I thought I would give the Chewnola Dog Treats a try thinking it would be even better. He took it right away when I gave it to him and chewed on it for about 2 minutes then left it alone. He will eat if it is the only choice he left it laying in the living room and went and got one of his rawhide bones. I gave it to him yesterday and you can barley tell he has eaten any.  There is only a little granola missing. I am starting to think he scratched the granola off. I don't think he likes the texture of the granola because it is a little sharp. This morning he was soaking it in his water bowl then eating it and it looks like he likes it a little better now that it is slimy"
0;This is a horrible product.  Never before in all my born days have I seen BROWN lemon sugar.  My first thought was one of the containers must be defective but all 4 are this ugly brown color.  Can't serve that to guests.
0;Congratulations Big Red! You have created the worst tasting beverage in the long and glorious history of soda! Forever my brain will cringe at the thought of bubble gum butt juice. I'm probably going to need some PTSD therapy from the terrible experience I had from drinking this horrible concoction. All thanks to Daniel Storey for recommending this garbage to me...(sarcasm)...
0;"""I have searched high and low for cotton candy flavoring to make cotton candy ice cream.  well I happened upon this product and ordered it.  When it finally arrived I tried it out in some vanilla ice cream and vanilla yogurt.  It tastes nothing like cotton candy and doesn't even have a candy like flavor to it...more of a strawberry.  It is horrible and I am very upset since there is no returns on grocery items.  If you are looking for cotton candy flavoring that tastes like real cotton candy or cold stone ice cream this is not the product"
0;Very disappointed.  I went by the picture and description.  I should have read the reviews.  This is not the same as someone else stated.  It has creamer with partially hydrogenated oil in it.  I don't want that stuff. I wanted the same as what is in the can that looks the same. Won't buy this again - doesn't even taste close to the other stuff.
0;"""Did not like this.  I threw 95% of it away.  It is very thin slices of marlin covered in sugar and soy sauce.  All I was tasting was sugar and soy sauce masking the marlin flavor.  The jerky also had so much sugar that it was sticking together in the package.  Will not order again"
0;Not impressed at all - first they are so small it was a joke.  Second the taste is horrible.  I have tried the other flavors and they aren't bad but this one has no distinct taste and not something I will buy again
0;I CANT REVIEW THIS FOOD...BECAUSE THE KIBBLE SIZE IS  H  U  G  E<br />UNLESS YOU HAVE A GIGANTIC DOG....I DO NOT THINK YOUR SM-MED DOG WILL WANT TO CHEW THESE! IM SO UPSET BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE CAN OF THIS WANTED TO MIX THE SAME AS CAN WITH THE DRY!
0;You will get the plain MALT and amazon will not fix it.  So I'm returning mine to Walmart.  There is a huge difference in taste btwn that malt and chocolate malt.  DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU WANT CHOCOLATE MALT!!!
0;This food made my 3 dogs very sick.  It was the worst dairrhea they have ever had.  Both the dry and the can food made them ALL REALLY sick.  i am was so upset I spent all that money and could not use the food.
0;"""I bought a case of this (Adult Organic Turkey and Organic Vegetables Formula)12.7 oz cans beause my dog adores the Organix Dry Dog Food  and he does very well on it. As soon as I gave him a little canned (a small amount mixed with his other food) he started vomiting white foamy stuff the following morning.  I ended up giving a can to a friend and her dog had horrible breath (from his stomach--does not have bad teeth). I didn't give the rest away"
0;"""Kellogg's Special K Red Berries cereal contains genetically modified organisms which have been patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and made them resistant to high levels of a chemical called glyphosate"
0;I recently found out that Special K and ALL other Kelloggs products contain genetically modified corn. The pesticide found in GMO corn has been found in the blood of 93% of pregnant women and 80% of their unborn babies in a recent study. I will never eat a single spoonful of Special K again. Unless of course Kelloggs decides to change its ingredients to non-gmo like it has done in Europe where GMOs are banned!
0;We first went from 4 boxes to 3....now we went from 8+ dollars to > 14 dollars. I will NOT pay this. Walmart and Food Lion are much much cheeper now. I will cancel this subscription today. Makes NO since.
0;My husband loves these candies and they are getting harder and harder to find.  I was terribly disappointed that this - as well as the scented gum that I ordered- was horribly stale.  They were just plain old.  I expected a lot more from Amazon and would be hesitant to order any perishable products through Amazon again in the future.
0;"""Mediocre  health  drink as it is...but at this price?????  This is mental when the same thing in Japan is about $0.50-0.80 per can.  The most expensive available was of course on Amazon Japan at about $150 per can.  Save your money and buy something local. Basically you are drinking curry powder"
0;I tried this product and must admit it is not for me...it does give me a surge of energy but it has a negative effect on my stomach and the crash for me is horrible after about 6 hours...I run and eat a low carb diet right now so maybe the combination is not right.  I purchased 12 cans and tried 4 of them...the remaining cans are still in the fridge as I can not take the feeling this product gives me...I hate to write negative reviews but felt compelled to share my experience
0;this candy is nasty as H E Double Hockeysticks... omg it taste like old people candy or like or your average run of the mill generic candy. it's nothing that you havent tasted before but please dont waste your money on this nasty candy
0;Disappointed in the receipt of this product. This box was damaged and was leaking from several cans of the product. This was the worst I have ever received a product over the 10 plus years I have been ordering on line. I lost 3 cans of monster because of the damage and will never order this product through the mail again. The product is heavy so sending it back was more expensive then just keeping the damaged product.Only had a picture (no video) of damaged product or I would have sent a picture of damaged product.
0;Wow.  I am very disappointed. This was supposed to be for my son's class snacks.  The box of rice krispies arrived open and the box was missing 4 treats. Is there any quality control or is it that they just don't care as long as they sell a product?
0;This is a review not on the Rice Krispies Treats but rather on the Seller. I ordered this 40 count variety pack and I was shipped a 24 count Original recipe box instead. Clearly this is a huge difference not only in money but in the product itself. I will be returning this ASAP as I feel completely ripped off at this moment. I am very dissapointed.
0;"""How very disappointing for a brand that markets itself as healthy. If you can get to Trader Joe's their fruit leather Fiberful is a much healthier choice.<br /><br />Always read the labels! Ingredients ORGANIC TAPIOCA SYRUP"
0;Wow everywhere it says no trans fats it says in the product dis and even right on the front of the bag BUT IT HAS TRANS FATS!! and thats not something i want in my trail mix it taste good but im really disappointed if anyone has a good alternative and around the same price to this mix please post a comment thanks!
0;I have 3 Grandkids (3 different families) all 2 years old and I can not get any of them to eat this stuff they all hate it. I'm not sure what brands their parents by them from the local grocery store but I will have to see if I can give these to someone else because they will not eat it ugh. What a waste of money
0;Very disappointed to receive a case of food product with a freshness expiration date of only two months after purchase.  It is unrealistic to expect that a case of Jiffy Pop would be used by a single consumer in two months.  I felt cheated.  I did not return the product as it seemed an excercise in futility.
0;Jiffy Pop seems like a fun product and is easy to use but I would NOT recommend it due to the fact that partially hydrogenated oils are used in it. That's very unhealthy and not something you want to be feeding your children. You're better off popping your own popcorn and adding your own non-hydrogenated butter.
0;This came up in a search for K cup and I am one of the suckers who ordered it. Very weak coffee.  And NOT returnable!  Amazon states products from other sellers are not returnable. This states it is from Amazon but when I attempt to return it states not returnable. Overall a frustrating transaction.
0;"""I was disappointed with the flavor of these. I really love the taste of nutritional yeast (I'm a vegan) but the only discernable flavor of these doodles was salt. I don't know why nutritional yeast is listed as one of the ingredients and the flavor non-existent. I think it may have been a marketing ploy to entice  health nuts  and vegans to buy them. It's too bad since nutritional yeast is so full of nutrients and flavor. If you are a vegan"
0;I love the regular style Pop Chips so when these were a Deal of the Day I grabbed a case of them. That was a mistake because these are gross. We had a party that weekend and put several flavors of this style of Pop Chip out and no one liked them. I have no idea what I'm going to do with all of them. I guess I'll take them to work because those people will snack on anything when it's free!
0;Item was not at all like items pictured or stated in ad. Food items were outdated and stale. Included items like halloween pocky and stale yogurt cakes. Received much better items from japan. Overall it was very disappointing.
0;"""I got some of these strawberry candies as a gift... and I should note they were NOT from Amazon and there were 6 months before they expired.<br /><br />I could not believe how terrible they were. It's as if each candy has absorbed some terrible plastic taste... something I smelled when I first opened the bag. So not to waste them"
0;"""I ordered Philippine Brand dried mangoes from Eauction and they sent Royal brand dried mangoes instead. The photo and the brand and manufacturer list Philippine Brand. Only way down the page in the description does it actually mention  Royal Brand  mangoes from the Philippines. If I'd known these weren't the product being advertised"
0;I had the Passionfruit tea on regular order and loved it.  I thought this might be a nice substitute.  It was not.  I felt as if my taste buds had been bludgeoned by the berry flavor.  If you like very strongly flavored tea then this is for you.  However if you are looking for a delicate flavor to compliment the tea then avoid this tea at all cost.
0;I purchased the product to give me relief with my PMS and diabetes but it is also for women who are breastfeeding so it also causes your breast to become larger and that is something i don't need so i wasted my money buying something i can't use!
0;"""I hate to give a bad review since I have no idea if it actually works to improve milk production (which is why I purchased it). I just feel the need to share that I took one dose and experienced a fairly severe allergic reaction. It was 2am and I went online and discovered that fenugreek is in the same plant family as peanuts (and chickpeas). This is not marked anywhere on the label"
0;"""Use with caution. When my baby was 5 weeks old I noticed that my milk supply was decreasing. I was taking 2 pills 3 times a day for about a week when I started felling really sick. I head strong headaches"
0;"""I'm surprised at how many people have given these cookies a high rating.  They are huge.  One I just pulled out of the box is 3 inches long by 2 inches wide.  I use treats to train my puppy and reward good behavior.  The StarMark Clicker literature suggests using a treat the size of a navy bean!  Dogs don't really seem to have any concept of size"
0;"""I read the reviews posted on this site and figured I'd give Shed Stop a try. My wife and I have a black pug that sheds like crazy. So far we have been using the product for three months or so and have seen absolutely no change in the amount of shedding. We have hardwood and tile floors so we can easily see the hair our beloved pet leaves behind. Before using Shed Stop we would vacuum three times a week"
0;"""I sent this stuff to tara and she told me this   sorry to say this but my rice you sent has  friends in it  must been the hot weather. I checked them all and they where full of little bugs...and I cooked some good thing i saw them as the rice heated up...gahhhhhhh <br /><br />not happy with this order..<br /><br />paul"""
0;zzzzzzz. I had high hopes for this coffee and have been really disappointed. I say you're better off buying Folgers and adding extra scoops to your filter then buying this. I had to use a lot to get a strong cup of coffee and still went to sleep several times after drinking. I think its over priced hype.
0;"""This is a great product but it is now in a  new  box different from the one shown.  4 of the  new  boxes burst  during shipping because the packaging did not adequately protect its vulnerabilities. 5 boxes had the plastic lids torn off the top but the seal seems intact for now.  3 seem ok.  Until they fix the terrible packaging of the  new  soup box"
0;"""I was attempting to fill a family member's Christmas request for  Gourmet brand of dark chocolate covered raisins .  I agreed to pay a standard shipping charge of almost 50%.  The product arrived in 6 days in a USPS standard envelope that was badly torn by our postal service.  The raisins"
0;I ordered a box of 24 bags of soy chips. I received them and opened a bag. The chips were darker in color than normal. I tasted one and it was sour. I looked and the chips had expired months ago. I had no option to return the bags. It was a waste!!
0;We didn't get to try it because the bag was opened and the bacon brittle was spilled among all of the packing peanuts. I had purchased it as a gift so there was no way I could still give it as a gift already opened and out of the bag.
0;This promised that there were 6 of the packages of dog treats.  When I received this there was only one.  Even the shipping weight listetd in the description leads you to believe that it is more than one package.  It flat out LIES!  Beware - I'm so disappointed in Amazon for allowing this to exist on their site.  I will be a lot more hesitant to purchase from here in the future.
0;Fuze is a great product. I can get it in my grocery store or at Target for a $1 / bottle on sale or $1.50 full price. This is a terrible price and add on to that the cost of shipping. Sheesh! I thought Amazon was the source of good deals.
0;I can't believe this product has such high review. The noodles taste like rubber and it is NOT spicy at all. Please just go to your local oriental store and look for ramen made from japan or korea. Those noodles actually have a nice texture and the spices they use are actually spicy.
0;I ordered these for my ten year old nephew's birthday. They sent  birthday cake pops and dipped strawberries. Didn't even replace them with a character cake pop and never contacted me about the switch. My nephew was looking so forward to the robots. Very disappointing.
0;Nutricity is the very worst ever place to order.  I ordered almond butter thinking it came in a glass bottle and when I received it it was packages in plastic.  I returned them and they send me an email saying they did not receive returns.  When I tried to get in touch with them with their 800 number a recording said they only handle returns via email.  I will never ever order from them.  I highly recommend that nobody ever orders from them.  When I ordered I never read that you couldn't return an item.  And then to top it off I could not talk to anyone in their company they handle all via email.  VERY DISSAPOINTING!  DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THEM.
0;Watch out when you order this!  This is only the 6lb bag and NOT the 20something pound bag!  You ARE NOT SAVING $70.00 something dollars.  there is not a store around that sells it for $80.00 - it is ALWAYS PRICED AT 16.99.  THIS POSTING IS VERY VERY DECEPTIVE!!!

0;"""We have ordered coffee for several months now from Amazon and always been pleased with the freshness of the coffee.  We recently ordered three more bags for our office and we were EXTREMELY unsatisfied with all three bags.  Non of them are fresh"
0;Always willing to try a new coffee brand but wish I didn't try this one.<br />After using  and trying different measurements for strength  I find it no better than cheap store bought brands.  An expensive lesson as now have four pounds of beans to use.
0;"""My two dogs turn their noses up at this flavor dog food.<br />Even Mikey who eats anything when fed with the other dog won't touch it.<br />I don't understand why as the texture of the food looked fine and I hadn't noticed any usual smell to it.<br />There was some left over steak that I cut up into little bits and put in with the food and they managed to get the pieces out and leave the food.<br />Needless to say I am trying something else to feed them.<br />Other than the dogs not touching the food"

0;"""My son and I who are both Celiacs loved Glutino wafers in both chocolate and dark chocolate varieties. We were on our 3rd box when I opened one of the bars and went to bite into it. It was the equivalent to biting into some sort of spongy rock. I immediately spit out what chocolate had fallen into my mouth while biting it. The bar itself seemed extremely stale to me. I went ahead and opened the remaining 3 bars in the box and the rest were normal. I also noted on the package that the product is made in Israel then processed in Canada"
0;"""About 3 months ago I researched all the different foods and finally decided to purchase EVO because I thought it was what was best for my dog.  He is 3 1/2 and healthy (or at least he WAS until recently).  He has routine physicals including bloodwork for kidney problems so I didn't worry when I read that this food can cause problems with underlying kidney disease.  One day he began having diarrhea and refused to eat... I thought"
0;"""I got the product yesterday.  The bag looked like it was opened and glued back together.  I was very hesitant to open it but my dog is running out of food...  It is just insane to believe that the original EVO packaging is so bad.  It wasn't air-sealed and the top fold looks messy.  Again"
0;"""I ordered these for my mother.  She did receive a teddy bear and flowers in a basket but the Teddy bear was white and super cheesy with a red bow. There were all these orange carnations that clashed with the rest of the flowers and I don't even see carnations in the picture listed. I paid $70 for the flowers with shipping and it was NOT worth it. The teddy bear in the pic looks like it has value"

0;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  There are no seals around or under the lids.  The lids on both paprikas and on fennel (also this brand) came loose during shipment spilling the contents.  I do not feel safe using these products but they cannot be returned.  I'm waiting to hear from Amazon on whether or not I can at least get a refund.
0;"""I had such a hard time with this fondant.  I have used Wilton for years and have done many good things with it so I decided to  step it up .  Boy am I sorry I did.  I had a 4 tiered anniversary cake to do in ivory.  I HATE coloring fondant so I figured this was as good a time as any to try a new fondant that was already colored so I ordered Satin Ice (...or SATAN Ice as I now call it).  I took it out of the tub and set it on the counter.  My 9 year old twins both said WHAT is that?!  I said  It's fondant!   Having seen me work with fondant for many years"

0;I had high hopes for this - I added it to seltzer water and it tastes every so slightly like root beer...more like diet root beer.  I was hoping to use this as a soda replacement to try to be a bit healthier - but I doubt we'll even finish this bottle.
0;I was really excited to find this product but was disappointed in the results.  I used it to sweeten some carbonated soda and the first sip was great.  Every sip after that had less and less root beer flavor and more and more of the artificial sweetener/alcohol taste.  So now I'm looking for another root beer extract to try!
0;The micro salt was not really powder.  The salt was micro in size but did not have the ability to cling or stay on  a food substance when applied. After thinking about it I don't think it can be changed into real powder form. Other then being really high in cost will stop me from purchasing it again. However I was glad to see this product exist in this form anyway. Thank you.
0;In the ingredients it lists k-carmine.<br />I was asked this question recently in a game and said no to some red food colors being made from beetles.<br />Well I was wrong.  Yeah i researched it all and there's other ways to list it even just natural color. =(<br /><br />I'm sorry if i ruined them for you like most people I have told.<br />But its really nice to know whats going in your mouth.<br />Shame on these people for calling it other names then crushed beetles!!<br /><br />At least i have 1 relative that will still eat them he said.<br />It's to bad this is about the only black licorice I liked.<br />Now they are just to hard to swallow.

0;"""I didn't like the Amish Red Popcorn at all.  98% of it did not pop in a hot air popper. What little that popped was too tough and almost tasteless.  I dumped it and bought Orville Redenbacher White Corn Gourmet. It was the kind of popcorn I love"
0;There were more hulls in this popcorn than in any other that I've ever used.  We found it to be very tough and after a couple of bites I ended up throwing it out.  Amazon gave me a full refund.  I would give them five stars for service.
0;I have been looking for red popcorn for some time and when I found this I was pretty excited and ordered it even though I had to order so much. I used to buy red popcorn when I lived in the midwest but have never seen it in the northwest. I have only popped it once and there were a lot of unpopped kernels.  My cheap yellow popcorn from the grocery store is much better than this.  I am very disappointed and don't recommend buying it.
0;I bought this and a few other Amish types from the same place. I think it may have been old and it didn't pop well in the microwave. I have much better luck with other types of popcorn. I would not buy again.
0;"""I love refried beans. I've been eating and enjoying them for almost four decades. However ... these aren't them! It would be much closer to what is in the can to call them bean paste -pale and flavorless"
0;The cherry kool-aid I got sucks. It is tart with very little cherry flavor. I have had much better cherry flavored water INCLUDING much more flavorful cherry kool-aid. Very disappointed because I think the manufacturer left their own product review just to off load carppy lot/batch of kool aid.
0;I can't believe an organic company like Earth's Best would produce a product that has BPA in it. The lids of all their jars have BPA in them. I contacted their customer service department and was told that it doesn't come in contact with the food as long as the lid isn't heated. But how do we control how hot the jars get while in transit to the store? So disappointing.
0;"""I wanted to make sure my baby has a good start just like all the parents out there. That is why I am buying organic food and I do my best to prepare fresh food for her when I can. I am so disappointed to know for a company labeling organic containing ''bpa '' in their lids. what is the point??<br /><br />I spend considerable amount of money and effort to make sure my baby is not consuming toxins. I buy bpa free bottles"
0;I was so excited to order this product-I make cupcakes all the time-FRom the picture on the box I thought the icing mix came with the cupcake mix-All I had was enough to barely make 12 cupcakes-I would have been better off buying a regular yellow cake mix-I think the front og box implies that you have EVERYTHING you need to make a cupcakes
0;so you get 5 bully sticks for 25 bucks if you subscribe and save.  Give me a brake... if I am giving my sweet puppy more expensive treats than I eat than i need a labotomy...check out the downtown supply 30count  6 inch bully sticks for 40 bucks...thats alot better value

0;I read some of the health benefits from this tea and decided to try it. Using 1 tea bag in a MrCoffe making 12 cups-this stuff was sooooo bitter. I put in 2 tea spoons of honey in a 1/2 cup of tea-still very bitter. The aftertaste lasted for days and so did the slightly quezy feeling. If it did me any good I haven't a clue what it was.

0;Not Completely Organic.<br />Better bars out there that are 100% organic.<br />The chocolate can melt easily- so beware if you live in warm area.<br />Product contains ALFALFA- a controvercial ingredient as that it may aggravate Lupus and is a possible toxin. There are other companies who make bars without this ingredient for this very reason.<br /><br />Price is rather expensive for NON-100% organic.

0;i bought these for the fist  time at Petco and they were brown and clean looking.<br />I ordered the 125 count pantry pack nylabone filet mignon flavored minis and they had green and black spots and were very hard.<br />Trying to return them = they look disgusting compared to the pack that I bought at Costco.
0;"""I ordered several flavors of the  Hint  water and all of them taste very medicinal to me.  I was expecting a little more  hint  of flavor of whatever was on the label.  Not so...I had to add Crystal Lite to them just to make them palatable"
0;I've been buying curry powder from different companies for about 20 years. This powder does not taste anything like curry powder. I even can't tell you how it tastes because it's the first time that I taste something like this. All I can tell you is that the taste is not pleasant. I think they made a mistake in mixing the ingredients. I got a refund on it.
0;"""I had such high hopes for these. I really wanted an easy quick and healthy meal for my toddler on those days we spend too long at the park and needed a really quick lunch before nap time. I thought I'd throw some cut up soy hot dogs in with these and it would be like 'healthy franks and beans.' Not so much. The taste was just awful. I wound up using them up in chili to hide the flavor. I was so sad because these were the only Eden Organic canned items at my Whole Foods. Glad I found a wider variety on Amazon"
0;I mistakenly bought 3 bottles of the stuff without tasting it first. This syrup taste like a bad diet drink from the 70's. I guess they just have not been able to duplicate the genuine flavor of sugar. I ended up trying it in coffee as a flavor and it still came up short. Three bottles down the drain.
0;I just learned that these lids are lined with a material that contains BPA. I fed lots of jars to my daughter so I am quite upset. Just canceled all of my subscriptions to Earth's Best jars. I am very disappointed. If you want to get this confirmed I would encourage you to contact the company.
0;i try a lot of different energy bar and breakfast bar things and strive to find healthy ones that also taste good. these go raw spirulina things taste awful. i tried to eat one while on a bike ride and after a bite or two had to spit it out. i even stuck my fingers in my mouth and wiped off my tongue. i can only think that when these go to sleep at night they dream of being an oatmeal raisin cliff bar.<br /><br />whoever created these things hates people or has a cardboard tongue.  i have a pretty forgiving palette. i eat everything but i couldn't get these down. it literally made me gag.<br /><br />be warned.. these are terrible unless you have no taste buds.<br /><br />sorry Go Raw.... but that's my experience.
0;I didn't really have very high expectations when buying this item but was disappointed nonetheless. The food is only going o be edible in a survival scenario. From what I have seen you will not want to eat it any other time. Expect to be turned off when you try it for the first time.
0;"""I'm glad I only bought one box.  My son took one bite and put it down and wouldn't try it again.  I tasted it and completely understand why he did.  It was crumbly and tasteless.  I've been eating them for breakfast so as not to waste them"
0;"""Bought these for dd for daycare without seeing it had peanut butter ( my mistake and not impacting review). I tried these. The taste is a bit off. Jelly tastes a bit off and there I really no nutrition. I am tired of seeing organic snacks with sugar as highest number in nutrition description. Going to have to make time and cook myself more. Too bad"
0;I threw out the Natural Balance dog food I had on hand (both the vegetarian and bison/sweet potato formulas)and won't be buying any more after reading complaints on ConsumerAffairs.com website regarding pets that died after eating tainted Natural Balance. A very disturbing aspect is that the company did not recall any of their pet food or even admit the problem even though they were notified multiple pets died or became very ill (with similar symptoms) quite suddenly and soon after eating the product. No more Natural Balance for my dog.
0;"""I know these Nylabone Galileo Bones are a great product.  Unfortunately Amazon sent me an opened and slightly used product when I ordered this.  I do not see anything about being used in this description.  The bone is scraped up and the packaging was opened and missing the cardboard (clear plastic packaging"
0;"""I bought this for my 5 year old 20 lb Jack Russell Terrier. She is an extremely aggressive chewer and most toys don't last 5 minutes. I thought this would be the perfect solution.<br /><br />I gave it to her a few hours a day supervised"
0;"""I was using this product and loved it. They just sent me the new and improved and I thought I had soap in my coffee cup. Washed it out and found out it was the new flavor. It taste more like butterscotch or carmel. It gives you an after taste. Not impressed"
0;"""I have been a user of Starbucks sugar-free syrups for about 5 years.  Their price has gone up from about $7 a bottle to over $10 a bottle.  I started looking for a replacement.  I ordered the Torani syrups as a lower-cost alternative.  The order arrived on time.  The price was good.  Problem is"
0;We bought this thinking it would be as good as the DaVinci.  It isn't even close.  This brand has a terrible after taste and doesn't even have a decent taste.  I love vanilla coke zero.  This ruins it!
0;I bought this because I love Torani's sugar-free Mango syrup and figured all their products would taste just as wonderful. Bad assumption. Now I'm stuck with 3 bottles that are not going to be used because they taste so horrible. Maybe I can give them to my sister.
0;One word to describe this product...GHASTLY!<br />One taste of this and I had to throw out the entire bottle.<br />It doesn't resemble carmel taste whatsoever.<br />The only reason I gave this one star is because I couldn't give it a 0 rating.
0;"""DAB nutrition's shipping prices nearly equal the price of the product.  Here's their response when I complained that they charged $32 on a $38 order of t bottles of syrup:   That product does not follow our general shipping rates and does not have combined shipping.   One box"
0;"""This company is totally irresponsible. they waited 18 days to let me know the juice was out of stock . true they offered 10% discount with another order. Since this is the only juice<br />I am not allergic to"
0;I just received these a few days ago. Had my first one only minutes ago. Now I need to drink a gallon of water. a sing 42gram serving has 300mg of sodium . Texture and beef/ostrich flavor is fine but is hidden by the heavy handed use of salt. I wish I could return the product.
0;I purchased this product once before from amazon and it was good.  Welll the last purchase of this product was bad.  The barbecue sticks were extremely dry and the taste was very poor.  I do like the product so I purchased from a bodybuilding supplements website and the quality difference was amazing very moist and tasty.  Will not buy this or any type of food product ever again from Amazon.
0;I read several reviews about this product and gave it a tried. I tried to like it but didn't work out for me after several bites even though I know it packed with great proteins and low calories. I'm just going to save it for emergency purposes but not for daily workout.
0;I was excited to get a healthy protein treat and I was hugely disappointed.  I opened the first one and was appalled by the smell. I managed to choke down three bites and the only good thing I can say about this stuff is that it didn't make me sick immediately. I threw the rest away. Later I went back in the kitchen and thought I smelled where my little dog had an accident but it was only the open package reeking from the trash.  I have eaten homemade  ostrich jerky but this tastes nothing like it. It is hard to believe it is ostrich. Do not buy this product. Even my cats and dog couldn't eat it.
0;This is really fake tasting and overly sweet.  The chunks inside the drink to not help either.  This is almost as bad as the Goya ones you see at the supermarket.  No recommended at all.  Try Vita Coco or Naked.
0;The bag arrived in very good condition.<br />The one star reason:<br />I was very disappointed that the bag of cracked wheat was not the coarse kind but was like very fine flour.  It is the coarse kind that gives bread the nutty texture we so love in our family.  I don't think it was advertised clearly enough for me to catch the difference but it's been awhile since I ordered it so I could have forgotten.
0;i subscribed happily but was very disappointed. I'm from South Asia so I'm familiar with this kind of food.<br /><br /> Dal Bukara - Black Lentil Curry : this was alright. I had to put more spices to make it better<br /> Palak Paneer- Spinach w/Cottage Cheese: alright
0;"""Received this for Fathers Day and found the basket contained mostly stuffing and over-sized boxes. The very decorative box of Angilina's  Sweet Butter Cookies  looked like it could hold 6-8 ozs.of cookies. Inside there were 2.2 ozs of tiny ordinary cookies laden with palm oil and made in Indonesia. The 2 oz. California Pantry  gourmet water crackers were edible with the Wisconsin cheese but had a lot of trans-fat and were made in Hong Kong. The 4 oz.  Focaccia Crisps Tuscan Style Crackers  were ho-hum"
0;A complete waste. Cost was $51.98 ($65.51 with shipping). Contents were probably worth 10 bucks at most and mostly tasteless. My dog didn't want it. Biggest rip-off I've encountered in a long time. I should have taken my wife out for a nice steak dinner.
0;"""I saw this Chai Tea when I was shopping here for the Tazo Chai Tea.  I read the 3 reviews which all gave 5 stars so decided to give it a try.  I have to say I am totally disappointed.<br /><br />No real flavor what so ever.  I was expecting a Chai Tea with a little bit of bite and I got quite a bit of nothing.  The description written up by the manufacture made the tea sound wonderful.  Again the 5 stars by the reviews sold me"
0;"""I bought 4 bags because of the good review.<br />I love coffee and have been a coffee drinker for 30+ years.<br />High expectation which met with very disappointing result.<br />I find this coffee very weak in smell and taste.<br />Folgers easily beats it and far far inferior to Blue Mountain Brand.<br />Now"
0;This coffee is very weak.  I am very disappointed with this coffee.  Not worth the price.  i would not recommend this coffee...  I signed up for delivery every few weeks. I will cancel my subscription.
0;I happened upon this item by accident when looking at coffee makers. While I feel Eight O'Clock Columbian is great coffee I can't believe anyone would pay this price for it.  I just purchased four bags for ten dollars ($10.00) at my local Giant Food Store as<br />it is on sale at two for the price of one.  I always stock up when they have this sale which happens every few months.
0;"""After I read customer reports on 8 o'clock coffee I hoped to finally fine the best for me. No it is not. I will give the other 3 bags to others.I will keep trying to find coffee at home like restaurant coffee I love"
0;"""I am not a big coffee drinker. But my wife is. She has bought this in the store and really liked the coffee. I discussed with her and we thought it would be a good idea to put it on subscription. It came. She made her morning coffee and boy I heard about it. You would think someone died. And that someone could have been me! Well to make a point"
0;I have been used to Dunkin and Starbucks. I decided to try something new and picked this one up at local store after reading rave reviews.<br /><br />I was thoroughly disappointed in this one. I whole heartedly agree with another comment posted here.  This is worse than office coffee!!!<br /><br />I found the coffee to be too light compared to Medium Roast of Dunkin and Star Bucks.  The flavour and aroma was akin to hot water run through an already filtered coffee grind.<br /><br />If you are used to stronger blends and richer flavours then you will not miss this one.<br /><br />If you are trying to move off coffee or want to go for a light coffee then you might prefer buying this.<br /><br />I am putting this to compost. This ain't my cup of coffee :(
0;"""Moved to Eugene from Medford back in 2003. Was able to keep my Dutch Bro addiction going. But then the drink<br />was not tasting as good. At first I figured the help in Eugene was not as good as the people in Medford. I tried<br />it plain and with chocolate. Then one day"
0;"""I was very disappointed with the Cento canned tomatoes I purchased recently.  I bought 2 packages of 12 cans each and every can was dented.  I realized that the reason they must be able to sell Cento much cheaper than in the stores"
0;"""<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005XOQZC >Nabisco Snack Wells Creme Sandwich Cookies 1.7 oz. (Pack of 12) 20.4 oz. net</a><br />I purchased these cookies in the store several times and thought they were a great alternative to other indulgences.  When I saw them on Amazon"
0;This review is actually written in Sept of 2011. The original was a glowing review but apparently I'm not allowed to review the same product twice. Really Amazon? This jerky used to be so good and now it's the weirdest ever. The packaging that used to be so easy to open is now impossible without scissors. The jerky itself is like squares of hard rubber that are nearly impossible to chew.I bought my usual boxes of original and teriaki and the flavors were almost identical. After years of being a fan (especially my husband who doesn't eat beef)I'm so disappointed in whoever is responsible for destroying a great product. To whoever designed the new packaging....you need to go back to the drawing board. How about the original? It was perfect on all counts as it was. From 5 stars to 1. Barely.
0;"""When I received this product it was poorly packed in a thin plastic package and included in a box with a couple of other products. As a result I got a bag of peanut butter and coconut crumbs that were smashed together and inedible. I ended up throwing the entire $10.00 package away. This is the first bad product I have received from Amazon"
0;Well I was excited to order this product because I can't find sugar cookie pop-tarts anywhere but I was extremely disappointed when they came because I had ordered two sugar cookie poptart boxes  but I only received one box of sugar cookie and one box of gingerbread of which I don't care for. Will never order this product again.
0;"""Last week we bought this product to replace  PediaSure  powder for our 2 year old. Out of three times our baby had this he threw up thrice and yeseterday's was the worst as we had to run to urgent care and spend 4 hours there. Finally as his system has cleaned up"
0;"""I KNOW EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT TASTES BUT THIS DIDN'T EVEN TASTE LIKE LICORICE !!!<br /><br /> I love licorice and I am always up to trying  something new but this was an expensive mistake. I read the reviews and thought these would taste pretty good. But if you  like red vines"
0;"""I decided to try this coffee despite some of the bad reviews.  I LOVE Cafe Altura's French Roast. It is wonderfully rich and smooth and so good that I crave it.  This Peruvian Dark smells wonderful but tasted like it had been sitting on the warmer for an hour or two. To me it tasted burnt. It was bad enough it made me feel sick to my stomach and couldn't drink more than 1/2 cup.  Maybe if you use a flavored creamer it would be ok"
0;I absolutely love Cafe Altura Columbian Dark.  I buy about 8 pounds a month.  I saw the Peruvian and decided to try it.  I thought that it was awful.  I made one pot and will probably throw the rest of it away.
0;This coffee is absolutely disgusting....just buy generic instant coffee and it will taste the same.  It even sounds like instant coffee in the pod when you shake it ( like big dry chunks.}  If you like dunkin' donuts coffee or donut shop coffee....this is NOTHING like it!!
0;"""I picked up a box of this coffee at Wal-Mart.  Thought the K-cups felt rather light when I put one in my machine.  The second it started brewing I knew by the smell it was instant.  I felt extremely ripped off!  The Keurig coffeemaker brews coffee  instantly  so why would anyone put instant coffee in a K-cup?? I called the company and they said Grove Square was not authorized to make coffee for them.  I returned the box to Wal Mart for a full refund.  I noticed the last time I was at Wal Mart"
0;"""These cups are simply little plastic container with coffee grounds...no filtration AT ALL.  Grounds leak out into coffee cup.  Terrible!  It almost seems like these are defective they are so bad.  One customer posted the picture of a practically empty cup after brewing next to an actual K-cup full of coffee grounds...yeah"
0;The big questions are:<br />1. Why would anyone put cheap instant coffee in a Keurig K-Cup?<br />2. Why isn't there a warning in advertising that the product is cheap instant coffee?<br />3. What are Amazon.com buyers thinking selling this crap?
0;This was hands down the worst coffee I've ever had.  I bought it because Amazon had it on sale for a fantastic price...little did I know that it was going to be so bad that no one in my office could drink it.  This coffee is a waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone.
0;If I could have it would have had no stars. This should never have been called coffee and Amazon should never had listed it as a k-cup I will stick with the keurig site or green mountain from now on for my k-cups.
0;Seriously the WORST coffee I have ever tasted.  I am a huge Amazon fan but I learned my lesson with this one... READ the REVIEWS and the product description carefully!  I never would have thought that a k cup could be instant coffee so I didn't really take note of the parenthetical description but I wish I had.  Now we're stuck with 36 of these nasty things.  I even took a box to work because med students will mooch anything but even those world class scavengers won't drink this swill.  DO NOT buy this unless you are a closet Nescafe fan.
0;This is actually instant coffe in a k-cup.  I was so irritated that I was sold instant coffee under deceptive practices that I informed Amazon how unhappy I was.  They immediately refunded my money and I threw the coffee out!  Maybe if enough people let Amazon know how unhappy they are they will stop selling this brand.
0;"""I don't believe that the  Instant Coffee  was designated when I first ordered this. I found this to be deceiving and a rip off. Why would I need a K Cup to make instant coffee at inflated prices?<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H3QBOA >Grove Square Coffee"
0;This K-cup is nothing but crappy instant coffee! What an insult that I even threw this money in the garbage on it! And thats EXACTLY where it went. I purchase my K-cups on autosubscribe for the extra 15% discount.....as such .....it is NON RETURNABLE. So in the garbage this crap went!<br />I am really disappointed for Keurig for even licensing that product for their brewers.<br /><br />Buyer Beware!
0;"""This product is merely instant coffee in a less than sturdy cup that happens to fit Keurig coffee makers.  The product itself tastes as bad as I remember Sanka tasting in the 80's.  There is no filter in the cup and no grounds left after you run water through it.  The dark roast is bitter"
0;"""because I never saw the (Instant Coffee) tag in the description. Was it there when I bought it? Not sure. All I know is that anyone who would go through the trouble to get a Keurig coffee machine wouldn't want to drink instant. Yes"
0;I was shocked when I received my shipment of this rip off instant coffee.  It doesn't even completely dissolve in my Keurig as it brews....a waste of time for a true coffee lover.  Just buy a jar of instant coffee.  They should not be allowed to sell this for use with Keurigs unless it clearly states...THIS IS INSTANT COFFEE!  It is unfair marketing and I will never again be duped by this company.
0;I should've listened to the reviews. This coffee is terrible. I am not sure why Amazon still has this producat available. I ordered 4 boxes and cannot even give those away as people in the office also say it's terrible.
0;"""Who would have thought you need to read the fine (and parenthetical) print for a K-cup product that you naturally assume would contain GROUND COFFEE? My somewhat paraphrased recommendation is DON'T FRACKIN' BOTHER. The resulting brew"
0;This has to be the worst coffee I've ever bought.  Amazon should offer a full refund to anyone purchasing it.  You might as well put a little dirt in a filter and run the hot water through it.  That's what it is...colored water.
0;"""1) The coffee is inferior to any other Keurig coffee I have ever had<br />2) The K-Cups LEAK like crazy and are a huge mess - a problem I have had with no other Keurig K-Cups<br />3) AMAZON WILL NOT REFUND THIS PRODUCT! So"
0;This is the worse coffee I have ever had. I admit I drank it many times because I had nothing else to drink and I wanted caffeine. It kind of taste like hickory or something. If you like instant coffee then get this item. But if you like instant coffee you probably don't have a fancy coffee maker to use them in. My 2 year old daughter loves playing with then though. shake shake shake
0;"""Stay away from the Grove Square products. I ordered this because I'd been so happy with the Amazon Subscribe and Save service in the past and these were the only K-cups available at the time I placed the order.<br /><br />Shame on Amazon for making this the only brand available! These are not  true  K-cups with the filter inside"
0;"""So I ordered this stuff fairly quickly and I thought that the  Instant Coffee  on the label was just a marketing thing as all K-cups brew instantly right... BIG MISTAKE!<br />This is actual freeze-dried"
0;I didn't look at the reviews before I bought this terrible product.  I wish I had.  It's hard to believe that someone would put instant coffee in a k-cup.  Even harder to believe that Amazon would sell it.  I have requested a refund.  Amazon should not dupe their loyal customers with products like this.  I would rate it a -1 if it was possible.
0;"""It is beyond me why anyone owning a keurig coffee brewer would want instant coffee.<br />I usually read all reviews (unfortunately I did not have time that day and did not want to<br />miss this  friday special.)   This is the way it was marketed to buyers on Amazon-<br /> Grove Square (TM) Single Cup Coffee - Dark Roast - 24 ct Box .  I find this deceptive and unfair<br />to unsuspecting customers.  This is instant coffee.  If you go onto Amazon"
0;If you want instant coffee go out and by Sanka. This is nothing more than instant coffee. The week after I purchased it I noticed it was on sale for only $10 for a pack 0f 2 24count boxes. I would not even pay that for it. Don't waste your money on aweful coffee!!!
0;Not what we were expecting in a k-cup.  This is weak coffee that tastes like instant coffee.  There is a reason it is cheap - buyer beware!  I would have given it a negtaive rating if it was possible to do so.
0;"""They say this is  Micro Brewed ....in other words-instant cooffee in a thin flimsy k-cup.  You would be better off buying a jar of instant and using the hot water out of the Keurig.  I feel this is a deceptive product.  I would give it Zero stars if I could.  Don't waste your money."""
0;"""Do not buy this  coffee!   I bought some at Walmart because of the price only to find that it's literally instant coffee in a K-Cup package.  Tastes awful.  Why buy an expensive single-cup dispenser only to use instant coffee???  This company should be shut down or sued for false advertising."""
0;"""I can only get a little comfort in the fact that I wasn't the only one that missed the fact this is INSTANT coffee!  (Who would buy instant coffee in a K-Cup?  Not me - at least not knowingly!)  Having said that"
0;"""Saw a box of this coffee at the grocery store next to the Green Mountain K-cups and noticed it was a lot cheaper so I figured I'd give it a shot. Well the old sang 'you get what you pay for' doesn't even do justice here because this coffee is not worth $1 a box"
0;"""Ordered the item on December 12th as a Christmas gift.  It did not arrive until late the 24th.  I made the mistake of just wrapping the box and putting it under the tree.  I was quite embarrassed when my wife opened the box and the K-cups were just thrown in the cardboard box.  An earlier reviwer's comments regarding the deceptive wording about the packaging apply here.  At least our adult children that were over for the holidays got quite a laugh out of it.  Upon inspection"
0;"""DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. A week or so ago I ordered this product when it was advertised as a pack of 8 boxes.  When I received my package it was missing 7 of the 8 boxes. I reported this to Amazon and they told me they were giving me a full refund for the purchase amount (instead of prorating the original amount) and then told me that since they couldn't accept a return on a grocery item that I should repurchase the item at the new link (this one).  I wish I was making this up.  When I arrived at this new listed item I saw that the total cost was much higher than my original purchase price and wrote Amazon back and told them so.  They then emailed me and told me to repurchase the item and they would refund me the difference. I am obviously very upset at this point"
0;can not believe how over priced this coffee is there are several other on-line sellers and i located this first in store and at  nearly half the asking price with no shipping charges the product is acceptable but the price is very difficult to swallow would never buy from this seller because of cost not poor product
0;I bought a whole bunch of these candy a while back and now just leaving a REVIEW. The candy must be old because it is super hard and tough to even CHEW. I just hope the candy they are selling is not old. I didn't realize the candy was hard until a few weeks later when I actually try eating it. They are still justing sitting in the box and I will throw them out. GROSS!
0;"""The product is YUMMY! and tasted even better since I got them from my local CVS store during Christmas time for $10 - so glad I bought more than one!  It seems to be strictly a seasonally stocked item"
0;I bought two different kinds of these crackers without trying them first.  They tasted like cardboard at best.  They did have a good crunch but tasted so bad that I tossed both boxes.  I can not eat wheat and have found that nutthins (a cracker made from nuts) are a fabulous substitute.
0;I have ordered Annie Chun items before to take to work for lunch and they were all pretty good.  This item however was VERY salty and the sauce had an odd taste.  I ended up throwing the other five packages away because no one in the house would eat them.
0;Was hoping this would taste good but I would of actually preferred those cheap top ramen packages over this!(which I hate)<br />Very over-powering flavor that tasted nothing like anything out of any good Asian restaurant.<br />Couldn't even take more than one bite before tossing it. Lesson learned to just go out to eat from now on when I'm craving Asian cuisine.
0;"""I ordered a whole box for work and was so disappointed when I realized they were all STALE! I usually buy these at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods but the price was better on Amazon so I ordered them. Unfortunately"
0;I thought that because it said the product was by LInette it would not have TBHQ and I would be ok.  These are not Linette peanut butter cups.  They are made by a company called sweet gourmet.com and on the front of the box it says that TBHQ is in the product.  TBHQ is known to cause cancer.  Thanks for not advertising correctly.
0;"""I received my order today of CUSTOM CULINARY MASTER'S TOUCH HAM BASE and was very disappointed.  I have used Custom Culinary products for over 5 years and it was in powder form. I thought I was ordering the same thing but it said no MSG's so that is why ordered Master's Touch"
0;Absolutely disgusting. They taste like dry cat food with a hint of cocoa. There's no good reason short of starvation that any human being should eat these things. I brought them to the shore to snack on with my friends and we all found them so bad we just threw them away.
0;We are healthy eaters so I was hopeful this would be a fun easy snack to pack for hot days when we are out and about. My 4 year old and 1 year old both think they are disgusting...since I bought 6 packs I guess I will be the one eating them and they really aren't good.
0;My dog loved these snacks which only used to have a few solid ingredients but then they added a bunch of crap to include sugar.  Dog treats shouldn't have sugar and even products from Milo's Kitchen which is supposed to be nutritious/wholesome has sugar.  I'm very disappointed and I reached out to them and they gave me a generic response (we have received your message and will forward to the appropriate folks).
0;"""Buyer Beware Please!  This sweetner is not for everybody. Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body. You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea"
0;I have ordered 8 boxes of these... while I like Annie's products this product has a major flaw...<br /><br />That flaw is the packaging... Long story short... about 33% of the bars are already open.<br /><br />This makes the bars rock hard and impossible to eat.... they taste like cardboard.<br /><br />I will cancel my S&S subscription until Annie's pull their heads out of their (you now what)<br /><br />Bottom line: I got ripped off.
0;"""These bars are very inexpensive for an 'organic' product. I tried one box of them and was very glad I didn't buy any more!  Even my husband who eats anything complained that they don't have much taste!<br /><br />As stated by others"
0;The granola bars are so hard you can not chew- my kids loved them when we purchased from the store and they were soft and chewy.  The expiration date is still 6 months out. Do not buy!! I plan on writing Annie's and letting them know about the problem.
0;The Candy Blocks were a nice visual for the Lego Birthday party but the candy has little taste to it.  Very little of the 2 lbs that I bought were eaten and I threw the rest away.  I would not buy the candy again.
0;"""I am writing this review to warn other dog owners of Blue Buffalo for dogs and what it has done to my  5 yr. old Miniature Dachshund named  Calla .  Back in late October 2011 I switched to Blue Buffalo after it was recommended by a family member. By mid-November Calla started to cry out at night.  We thought it might be a back issue and our  Three  yes three Vets agreed that it could be Intervertebral Disc Disease.  We had blood work done in November and everything looked fine with the exceptions that she was a  little  dehydrated. After months of treatments"
0;"""I use canned asparagus only for pureeing in soups where the lack of texture doesn't matter. I have used most every brand of canned asparagus and this is the first I've ever bought that was so stringy and woody I had to press the soup though a sieve and thereby waste a good part of it. To add insult to injury I paid a premium for it over the good house brand I usually buy"
0;"""Why are these companies still using this poison (Aspertame)? I am pre-diabetic and watch my sugar intake.<br />It's hard to find sugar free without aspertame. I think some manufacturers are starting to wake up. I think<br />Monsanto needs to be taken to task"
0;"""I really wanted to enjoy this tea:  great aroma and lots of fruit chunks (like a tea  trail mix ).  Don't understand how something that smells so much like apricot when dry doesn't taste like apricot when prepared as tea.  I found this rather bland as a hot tea and more on the sweet side when iced.<br /><br />In my book for apricot tea"
0;I knew something was wrong when I opened the bag.  The beans had no shine or smell.  The coffee is worst than any off the shelf store brand and cost more.  I thought I could never taste a bad coffee until I bought this and now I have three bags! grrrr
0;We drink several cups of coffee per day.  We decided to try this after getting a good price for it.<br />It's so bad (per our taste buds) that we'll probably end up tossing it.  We don't buy Folgers or Maxwell House so we can't compare those.
0;I've had worse but not much. A lot like Royal Cup or Maxwell House. Very dishwater like.<br /><br />For economy decaf beans I'll stick with Costco's Seattle's Finest Columbian. Way better than this weak stuff. I can't even give the other 2 bags to friends.
0;"""I did everything right. I plowed my garden with my tractor completly turning under the dirt and weeds. I then disked till any weeds were pulversized and then roto tilled with the tractor and a 5 foot rototiller until there was not a sign of weeds left after this process. I spread the PREEN even heavier than recommended. THE WEEDS IN MY TOMATOES and PEPPERS ARE DOING GREAT THOUGH. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! DO NOT TRUST THE ONE OR TWO GLOWING REVIEWS LISTEDE UNDER THE SEVERAL LISTINGS FOR THIS PRODUCT. Ask yourself if you trust these reviews/reviewers. I say they have  skin in the game  and cannot be trusted. Who are they really-actually buyers or shills for the Manufacturer/sellers ? I know where I'd put my money. I'm fortunate in that I did not pay the full overpriced amount for mine. I bought it at the end of the season when Sam's Club was practically giving it away for pennies on the dollar. I used it the next spring so it really should not have been affected by any expiration date or anything like that. IT JUST DOES NOT WORK."""
0;"""The tea is loose in the cup and the tea comes out into the cup.  Not drinkable.  It's like pouring loose tea into your cup and filling with hot water.  It needs to be strained!  I wanted to return the tea but it's not a returnable item"
0;"""*** Buyer Beware: Note that all negative reviews are from Amazon verified purchases. The positive reviews may be shills! ***<br /><br />The  tower  is less than 1 foot and most of the stuff inside is paper straw filling. Imagine going out to the grocery store and getting a few random bags of low-quality chocolate and stuffing them inside a box along with straw. Hardly an item worth giving as a gift. Unfortunately"
0;"""This was supposed to be a present for our neighbors but unfortunately we decided not to give it to them because a very disappointing item. The pictures on Amazon are quite deceptive giving the impression that it's a large box or tower. But the actual tower is barely taller than a bottle of wine and contains chocolate for no more than a couple of people.<br /><br />For $40"
0;I cannot accurately review this product seeing as how it was in transit so long that it was melted and solidified so many times that all of the items inside were in some interesting looking blobs.......will never order any products like this again...
0;"""This company is a huge joke. I ordered two plants from this company.  The first plant was dead on arrival.  We paid for expedited shipping and it still never arrived in time frame specified.  No wonder it died. I called the company and could bearly understand the guy.  They said they would send a replacement and it still hasn't arrived.  The plants are nothing like what is pictured in the advertisement.  The second plant is so small"
0;Absolutely gross! If you can imagine swallowing a mouth full of gel that will barely go down unless a glass of water is handy. I cannot believe Power Bar Company would put something out like this! We are stuck with a case of this garbage. DO NOT BUY!
0;"""Good product but I only received a single gel package instead of 24.  The so called  replacement  package came with only 22 gel packs.  And I was billed twice.  Obviously some kinks with distribution and customer care need to worked out."""
0;I love the smell of coffee. This however was one of the worst smells ever. I could smell it immediately after pressing brew and it smelled so bad I just threw it straight down the sink. What a waste of money.
0;"""I have had there French Vanilla and really enjoyed it. Whatever this product is i do not know. It has a strong Chemical smell that is over powering before you even get a chance to taste it. it reminds me of a high school chemistry lab.<br /><br />I tasted this coffee hoping maybe it would only smell"
0;NO STAR RATING FROM ME!!  This coffee is the worst coffee I have ever tasted. It has an awful smell too. It leaves a terrible after taste that lasts all day. I am going to try to return it. I will never buy the Gloria Jean French Vanilla K-Cups again.<br />Please bring back Van Hutte French Vanilla K-Cups again in your subscribe and save program!!!!
0;"""I bought the product and several flavor extracts from their actual website.  I don't want anyone else to have to go through the same frustrations for lack of information.  The extracts I received are so far off from the intended flavors that I doubt the solution's even edible.  The site claims natural flavors.  These were destroying all my senses.  Let's start with the vanilla"
0;I liked the price of this extract and champagne flavoring is not the easiest to find.  I opened the bottle.. and it smelled off- kind of sickly sweet and medicinal.  The taste was incredibly far from any champagne flavoring I have ever tried- disgusting.  Don't waste your money-
0;"""Absolutely disappointed with this product. I was so excited to see it finally at my door. Then I opened the box and the smell of cheap plastic was overwhelming. I said  hmm it will go away eventually "
0;Beware! This coffee has natural and artifical flavoring! Personally I do not want that in my coffee. That tells me that company roasting beans adds that since they do not know how to roast well to get good coffee.<br /><br />Unhappy and will never buy this again.
0;Don't buy this chocolate PB2 here. Go to Bell Plantation's site to get four jars for just a bit more. I can't believe the price from this seller. Shop around<br /><br />The product really is amazing. Two tablespoons of chocolate peanut butter for just 45 calories! It's a real treat! Creamy with good peanut and chocolate flavors. I like the chocolate PB2 better than the plain PB2.
0;"""With all the top heavy happy reviews I expected more.  This barely lasted us through 10 peanut butter sandwhiches and it was just  eh.   It is not over the moon mouthwatering flavor.  And for how long it lasted"
0;I honestly couldn't taste even a hint of peanut butter or chocolate in this product.  Waste of money!  I'd rather not have peanut butter than attempt to substitute with an inferior product like this again.
0;I place order on 29 May 12 . But this snack expire on 16 Aug 12.<br />I also order about 200-300 bottle of Gerber Graduate!<br />I got only 48 days to eat all of it include shipping day to eat 4 paxs of this.<br /><br />How do i eat all of it within that time.<br />Another product also almost expire.<br /><br />Poor!!!!!!<br />Why you do with your royal costumer like this.<br />I pay you a lot every mounth!<br /><br />Bad Bad Bad Bad !!!!!!<br />If it almost expire just keep it away or send it to the bin.<br />Don't give it to me.<br />Waste of money!
0;"""I have owned a Keurig brewer for over 2 years and have never had a problem with any K-cups. I had previously purchased these K-cups as part of the Subscrible and Save program and had been happy.  The last order I received has been a disaster"
0;I ordered this coffee for my Keurig brewer and I was very disappointed with the flavor.  It was very bitter and acrid.  I like strong coffee--but this was just unpleasant to drink.  I ordered 2 cases and we managed to finish off one of them... I'm giving the second one away as I can't bear to drink another sip of it.  It tastes like burned rubber.  Blech!  I can not recommend this product.
0;This is the absolute worst coffee I've ever tasted! I love strong coffee and this was awful. One reviewer said it tasted like burnt rubber...YES..that's it! I'd also say it tastes like rotten sour garbage. (Not that I've ever tasted that!) But the way old garbage smells in a dump or that's been sitting in a garbage can outside in the hot sun for several days...that's what this tastes like. Don't waste your money on this!
0;"""I originally tried the variety pack that came with my Keurig and it had the Bold Organic from coffee people which was excellent-- I went online to buy some and saw all the great reviews for Black Tiger which steered me to buy it instead of the Organic. Boy"
0;"""I'm surprised at the good reviews... maybe there are quality control problems.... I purchased some this week and I find it bear very little resemblance to Almond butter. When I opened the jar I smelled oil"
0;"""I really don't think Amazon should try to sell natural products such as this that require refrigeration or temps below 70F and short storage life.  The box for this product had an unsealed top and the bars were floating around the bigger box it came in. I almost bit into one bar but fortunately opened it outside with sun light and could see well lots of green mold on it. Then I looked on the other bars and they were mostly all spoiled.<br /><br />The other pecan bars I ordered were not spoiled"
0;"""I have to agree with the reviews that comments on the texture as well as the taste.  I also bought 12 and had to throw out 11.  I was really disappointed as the picture looked nothing like the finished product.  The gloppy green paste that was the result had a really questionable taste"
0;I am an avid fan of these pretzels and order often. This particular box had a rancid smell and bad taste to them.  I was very disappointed as I purchase these and the whole wheat pretzels often and have never have this problem before.  I will hesitate to order again as they can't be returned.  This particular product has no expiration date so it is difficult to determine shelf life but like I said I normally would give them 5 stars!!
0;"""I inherited my Keurig from my late mother. Store coffee pods seemed too weak. I read the reviews for  Jet Fuel  and decided to order 50 pod package. I like a bold coffee but this has a very bitter taste. I'm going to try again"
0;Like others I havew had at least three instances of grounds in my cup.  Also two instances where the Keurig just couldn't push the brew through the cup.  Just failed.  None of the other types of K-cups have ever done this.
0;"""I read many reviews before buying both Jet Fuel and Black Tiger because I really wanted an extra strong k-cup brew. I hate to say this but neither of these brews are stronger than any other  extra bold  brews I have tried. If you get this just know that you still need to use a smaller amount of water to make a strong cup of bold tasting coffee. I think the new Starbucks bold brews actually make a stronger cup of coffee."""
0;"""About every 5th or 6th cup I get a cup full of coffee grounds! This coffee isn't that cheap to have to throw away that many cups and still make it worth it. It isn't that good either! I'll never buy  Coffee People  K-Cups again."""
0;"""I purchased this coffee for my office machine and immediately started getting complaints. When I tried it my self I thought it was some of the worst tasting coffee I've ever had. It is tolerable when loaded up with sweetener"
0;"""Update to my review:  August 2012:  It appears they have changed the formula for this coffee.  It now tastes very thin to me.<br /><br />It used to have a good film of oil on the top after brewing (I don't know what that oil slick is called - but I see it on all the good coffee I drink).<br /><br />Anyway"
0;" ""Busy  Bone?  these are grossly overpriced for what they are.  My dog is  busy  for about 5 minutes and then it is gone.  When will anyone make something that a dog can really chew on.  As for smaller dogs"
0;I have tried the regular and chocolate flavored variety of this mix and love it.This one tasted like someone put way too much baking soda in it. I have not been brave enough to reorder it yet to see if it was a manufacturing error.
0;"""I agree with the recent 1-star reviews of this product. I'm referring to this product as  this product  because I don't know what else to call it. It's certainly not soy milk because it now contains very little soy. I've been using this product for years"
0;"""The reason I purchased this product is for the  No Sugar Added  clause. I am annoyed with all the sugar that is added in almost everything. Every kids cocoa drink has too much sugar added. After I tasted my first drink"
0;This product maybe good but I can not testify to this as my shipment came to me so damaged I was afraid to eat the product.<br />It had been dropped before shipment was obvious because the shipment box was not damaged and the cans were severely damaged on the<br />rims and side of cans.
0;"""The predominant flavor in the Knorr Teriyaki rice is dehydrated onion/leek. The ingredients list says dried leek and onion powder. It is just too much. It tastes like the bad dehydrated meals we used to eat on several day backpacking trips when I was a child.<br /><br />Other people love this as I can see from the reviews. I would say that you should consider what sort of palate you have to figure out whether you are in the love it or hate it group. If you are like me"
0;This was seriously revolting - the sauce was sour-ish and smelled awful. Even hot sauce could not save it. I was disappointed because Annie's other gluten-free mac and cheese is so much better and cheaper.
0;"""Tea is very subjective.  If you are looking for a tea that does not taste like Rooibos but more like black tea then this may be perfect for you.  As a forty something Afrikaner who has drunk tea his whole life I'm not a big Twinings fan. Numi is an easy to find brand of Rooibos teabag and I much prefer the flavor to the Twinings offering.  If you want the tea bags they buy and drink in South Africa buy the Freshpak here on Amazon<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001590IC >Freshpak Rooibos Tea 80 tagless bags (2 x Pack)</a> .  If you want  real  tea you'll need a kettle and a tea pot. I use 3 tablespoons of Davidson's Organic Rooibos <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SATIE6 >Davidson's Tea Bulk"
0;"""I bought this product because I absolutely love Thai food and wanted to make it at home.  This did not taste like the Pad Thai I am used to.  I have eaten at many different Thai restaurants in the Washington DC area and this doesn't come close to their Pad Thai sauce.  Now"
0;not advised to get this seed kit. the peppers grow taller than the aero-garden before setting any fruit.<br /><br />stick with the basic herbs that come with the original garden as they are the only ones that will grow in the limited space.
0;Dont waste your money on on this. Use rock wool instead. I called the company asking what kinds foam is in their kits and they wouldn't tell me they described it as bio degradable special foam - so I called a couple of foam companies asking questions and experimented a bit. What worked best for me and is drastically cheaper is rock wool instead.
0;"""I don't know if it was just me or what but I CANNOT get any tomatoes to grow.<br /><br />I've followed all of the instructions (of which there are many) and so far I've only had flowers bud but then never come to fruition.<br /><br />I've done the manual pollination"
0;"""This is the first kit that I've had trouble with.  I love the herb kits in general.  I think I was able to get about 8 - 10 tomatoes TOTAL out of the entire life of these 3 plants.  I followed all directions"
0;"""I don't know how ANYONE could rate this so-called  cat  food above a 1 star - it is CRUD.<br /><br />The food is cheap - stuffed full of fillers.  My 4 cats prefer to eat old and dried up Fancy Feast crumbs before they even eat a bite of this junk.  It comes out of the cans like a hard lump - the liquids drain out and you end up with a brick that has to be broken apart.<br /><br />Well"
0;"""This product arrived on time but it sure wasn't fresh.  The caramel part is hard and one must hold it in their mouth awhile to soften it up so it is chewy.  If this had been the first product I purchased thru Amazon I would not be purchasing any more thru you.  I have purchased the vanilla caramel creams locally many times and they were nice and soft and chewy.  Cannot get the strawberry or chocolate flavored creams here so decided to order thru Amazon"
0;"""We were talking about candies that were around when we were children and Fizzies were mentioned. I use to love Rootbeer flavored Fizzies when I was a kid. I couldn't get them out of my mind. I checked on Amazon to see if they were still being made and to my surprise they were available. I bought a 6 pack. When they arrived"
0;Be aware that these treats are made in China. We received the mini twistz as a Christmas gift for our dogs and one of our dogs started having petit mal seizures about once a week after Christmas. We couldn't figure out what was going on but when a friend pointed out that these treats were from China we tossed them real fast and sure enough the seizures have stopped. Of course I can't prove that the seizures were caused from these treats but I can't help think there's a connection.
0;Was very disappointed.  I have used this product in the past and was happy with it.  So much so that I would consider drinking it for just a decaf tea.  This time it seemed to be different.  There was no taste and I had left the tea bag in the cup and at the end of the day smelled extremely bad.  Totally grossed out that I had drank it.
0;I don't write reviews ever but I feel the need to do it this time around. I did not pay attention when I ordered this tea because I wanted to order the Yogi one. The taste is not as good and the Yogi did such a better job with my mily supply. I bought the two pack so I will finish them but it is not helping at all but I figure at least I am taking in liquids :-( I will order Yogi again and do not reccomend this one if you are serious about maintaing your milk supply IMHO.
0;These cookies were absolutely inedible. They were stale and extremely hard.  The only thing nice I can say about them is they are really cute... Just don't eat them. I bought them for a suoerbowl party for my son's kindergarten class and the kids who managed to take a bite immediately spit them out. They were a complete disappointment.
0;I grew up drinking coconut water in Jamaica and have been getting the Vita Coco brand which is decent but not great.  I decided to try this based upon the great reviews and am VERY VERY disappointed.<br /><br />This is probably one of the nastiest things that I have ever tasted and is a very poor excuse for coconut water. It literally tastes like water flavored with artificial sweetener with plastic added.<br /><br />I am going to see if I can return the case to Amazon.
0;"""This is the first time I had the opportunity to experience Taste Nirvana's Real Coconut Water and I must say what a disappointment. This has to be absolutely one of the worst products that is being marketed as Real Coconut Water. The very first thing I noticed when I opened the can was a chemical odor coming from the coconut water. This was the first indication that I knew I would not enjoy this product and probably was a waste of money. The second issue I had with this product was the taste was way off when compared to real coconut water actually comes from the tree.<br /><br />This product is a real waste...Zico"
0;"""I know Amazon has its disclaimer that the information it provides may differ from the information on the actual packaging of the item.  So I probably should be upset with Genisoy about this issue.  When I got the package"
0;"""I am not happy at all with this product at all. I brought some Mexican vanilla back with me on my last trip and this vanilla smells like pure alcohol.<br />It has a harsh smell. The real Mexican vanilla has a beautiful warm"
0;I compared this mangosteen to the same brand I bought at a health food store and found this one was watered down and almost tasteless and much thinner consistancy. I would not buy from this seller again.
0;I bought this product on September 2010 and this product expires on the 27th of August 2010. I have bought alot of products with amazon and until now I had no problems. I dont understand why Amazon would send me a product that would expire two months after I received it.
0;"""I placed my order through Amazon and after about 10 days inquired about my order because it had not shipped.  I received an email back from Starbucks that my order had been canceled. No explanation at all"
0;"""Starbucks again has made an exceptional product and almost ruined it with bad packaging!<br /><br />The instant coffee is in a new world of flavor (for instant) better than most of the coffee in hotels for example.<br /><br />BUT BUT BUT<br />the tube package is a disaster.<br />It is hard to open.<br />It does not open across the entire width of the tube<br />SO the powder is very very difficult to get out of the<br />tube.<br /><br />Indeed"
0;I RECEIVED A PACKAGE.  I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS IN IT BUT OPENED IT AND THERE WERE STARBUCKS VIA PACKETS ALL TOSSED IN.  I SORTED THEM AND REPACKED AS IT WAS FOR A GIFT.  IN THE AD IT LOOKS LIKE THE PACKETS COME OUT OF A BAGN OR BOX.  IF SO PLEASE SEND ONE.  THEY ARE A MESS ALL OVER THE DRAWER. THIS IS NOT TOO LATE FOR YOU TO FIX.  IF YOU DO I WILL WRITE YOU A NEW REVIEW.  I REALLY WANTED TO GIVE THIS AS A GIFT.DISAPPOINTED IN STARBUCKS.
0;I remember eating this product many years ago when I was a kid. Sometimes you can't go home again. No flavor at all.<br />Even my dog wouldn't eat it. I gave it to my neighbor who has kids. They will eat anything.
0;This is WAY too much for crawfish.<br /><br />3LBS should run you between $9-$13.<br /><br />This is $30... plus another $30 for shipping.<br /><br />You could get 3LBS of live crawfish mailed to you(much better than pre-cooked) for the same price.
0;French Market chicory coffee is so verrry strong. It must be mixed with other regular coffee(at least 1/2 to 1/2)  I have two cans left and haven't opened yet. Does anyone want to buy them back from me?
0;I am so disappointed.  I ordered Hazalnut flavor and received another flavor. I have no way of reaching anyone. I feel I have been ripped off. I need help.  someone please help me. My money is gone. who can I blame?
0;"""I don't know how anybody can say this tastes even at all close to starbucks white mocha sauce. It has a really bad artificial after taste and is not rich and buttery like starbucks white mocha. My husband and I both drank this equally and he agreed that it was not worth a second purchase. If you really want a good white mocha"
0;"""Well the sauce is great...I can make my  Starbuck's  style coffee white mocha for a fraction of price....except the sauce I bought expired 60 days after I bought it....I love mochas but come on....It should have been at least 6 months."""
0;"""This is the worst Earl Grey tea I've ever had. Bar none. The tea is so incredibly weak it is indistinguishable from normal black tea. I kid you not. I often looked at the box and the bags trying to determine if some mistake in packaging was made. The insert says  mild flavor  and they really do mean it. So mild you cannot taste the bergamot oil at all! I ended up using these as black tea filler in my iced tea mix"
0;"""I bought this stuff because a recipe for  champagne cake  called for it...yuck!  It tastes all plastic and gross!  I would not buy again.  I don't blame the seller though -- they're just selling what recipes all for!"""
0;"""I bought 4 boxes of Russell Stover assorted chocolates for gifts.  I opened one box.  They were horrible.  Chocolate was of poor quality.  The candy has a chemical artificial taste.  I am going to toss these.  I would be embarrassed to give these to anybody.  For anybody with discerning taste"
0;"""Why? Why does this coffee exist? I have never had coffee that tasted this bad. Why would anyone make something like this?<br /><br />How does one make coffee taste so terrible that you must force yourself to swallow each and every sip. I would much rather take shots of bottom shelf tequila. Coffee like this is the reason why Starbucks and other coffee chains are still in business. Not because they make great coffee"
0;"""This product contains propylene glycol and BHA which is poisonous to dogs. Look it up. We threw away a $20.00 bag of pup peroni tonight. Our dog began having seizures after we started a training class with her where they recommended using pup peroni. We used the pup peroni as a training treat as recommend. Not realizing that was the culprit for the seizures"
0;"""The defective packages have holes or ripped areas in the bottom. This let air in and caused entire contents to solidify. Some of these opened packages had been re-sealed with scotch tape. The outer carton was in good shape"
0;If you have a Bunn single cup coffee maker that uses the Senseo coffee pods don't buy this.  It's way too big and no amount of trimming will make it small enough.  I read the part about it not fitting other machines but assumed that was written back before there were copycat machines.  The Bunn uses the Senseo pods and they fit quite well.  It would help if the description gave the dimensions of the product instead of the packaging.
0;I feel that I have really given this product a fair chance but I can't get it to work for me.  I have tried many different amounts of coffee and even running the Senseo with the filter completely empty and I still get leaking water all over the place.  I've seen several reviews with very satisfied users...what is the secret?
0;"""This tea is horrible. The product has a dirty laundry smell and does not taste much better. I expected better from something so expensive. It is simply not worth it. Cheaper white teas from other brands are much better. Rishi"
0;"""My fault for not reading through all the negative comments. This is not coffee. It is pure chicory that<br />Is not meant to be brewed alone. At the rate of 3 parts coffee to 1 part this I should not get thru<br />One bag before the expiration date of dec"
0;"""I placed a few orders from Amazon on the 16th and most of them shipped the next day ot two at the most. This seller finally shipped my item 10 days after my purchase. I finally received my item on the 28th"
0;the jerky its self is not bad but its really hard and there's more fat on them then actual meat.. why would you buy a 4 pack and spend almost 30$ Bucks when you can juts goto the store and buy 1 for 3$? This is ridiculous... Dont buy online juts goto Walmart.
0;"""Please do not buy into this product being a pure back-to-nature good for you...good for the environment product.  IT IS NOT.  It contains palm fruit oil.  Cutting down of these forests could spell the complete demise of the orangutans as this is their habitat.  Palm fruit oil is used in soaps"
0;What the description doesn't tell you is that it contains palm oil.  This trumps anything they say about it being natural.  I could still feel the palm oil in my mouth over an hour after eating this product.  Heaven knows what it is doing to my body.  I would never buy this product again.
0;"""I love these hershey's coconut kisses but these arrived melted and RUINED. I understand it may just be because Southern California weather can't be helped - and chocolate is supposed to be a shelf-stable 'non-perishable' food. However"
0;"""I bought these because the regular packages of Sunrise Orange Crystal Light were not available in any local stores. The drink mix powder sold in these 2-gallon packets is not the same as the product used in the 2-quart packets that are sold in retail stores. It is whiter and more powdery"
0;I ordered this for my son's dog..so he wouldn't need to buy it for awhile. A week after it arrived I learned that this brand had been involved in a major recall for food poisoning and even people handling the food (and some just petting dogs that ate it) were made very ill and the potential for fatalities was alarming. I tried to get specifics from vendor and brand but got nada..I ended up looking it up and found thevey been involved and 4 or 5 serious recalls since 2003.

0;"""I bought 6 of these in Jan 09. They had an expire date of 2010. I opened up one of the packages and I found two moldy pieces. I didn't want to risk mold in the other packs so I tossed them out. I email Dogswell for a replacement"
0;The Dogington Post issued a warning about Dogswell sweet potato chews.  This product comes from China.  The Veterinary Information Network lists four such products as implicated in the poisoning of dogs eating them.  This product is one of them and should not be given to our pets.
0;Don't buy these.  I have a very large German Shepherd and cut a piece for him when he had trouble eating it.  I tried soaking one but it still retained its very hard texture.  I'm afraid of this product and think a dog can choke on it. It's inedible and I will never buy it again.

The color is brown and the taste is the same as chinese tea. Do yourself a favor and buy Green Tea from an Asian grocer or try Yamamotoyama brand. Those really have a distinct flavor and it is actually  green.  Don't be fooled by Bigelow."""
0;"""I would never buy this product again.  It is the worst quality olive oil--made from the last of the leftovers of the olive pressing process (that is what  pomace  means).  I didn't know that before I bought it"
0;I love the Kashi Dark Mocha Almond bars but the TLC fruit and grain with chocolate layer was IMO tasteless and funky. Maybe if I hadn't eaten in a week  I would try one again. I had my husband take them to his work to get rid of them.
0;"""Since I was looking for a truly safe sweetener I read some articles about products labeled raw agave nectar. It is actually just chemically refined fructose and no better for your system than any other sweetener natural or refined and worse than some.

0;"""I was dismayed to learn that agave is actually highly refined fructose... worse for you than corn syrup.

0;"""This tea used to be delicious but the company recently changed the recipe claiming a  new bolder flavor.  Unfortunately it now tastes nothing like peach tea and don't expect to be able to return it. They won't allow it."""
0;This is my favorite coffee - enough bean so it's not like drinking hot brown water but mild enough not to send this old heart into overdrive.  On a fixed income I check for sales.  Got this two pack on sale.<br /><br />First time was fine but the second time was a mistake.  I kept thinking I'd made the coffee wrong.  Then I decided I must need a new coffeemaker - tho' mine is only a few months old.  So I dragged out the old Braun and brewed up a pot.  YUK it tastes like they swept the floor and put that in the can.  I'm tossing the rest - not drinkable.<br /><br />Whatever the label says - this is NOT Folgers Breakfast Blend.
0;"""These freeze dried strawberries have a horrible taste with an  overtone  of stale. I had been buying freeze dried strawberries at Trader Joe's which are wonderful and I hoped to save some money buying these. No such luck....... Avoid these."""
0;I was very displeased when I received the Feuilles de Brick. I had to cater for an important client. All the ingredients ready to be  assembled in the Feuilles and due to their dryness (the Feuilles de Brick) I could not bake my desserts.
0;"""I recently ordered these and was extremely disappointed.  Here were the problems:<br /><br />1) OLD!!  They actually tasted dusty and I could feel no potency in them at all.<br />2) Wolfberries not Goji Berries.  Since I've consumed Goji's from many sources over the years"
0;The expiration date was only a month out. They where already stale and hard like pebbles. Called them up and their customer support was awful. Talked to the owner and she didn't have a clue about 1/2 her products. Never buying from them again!!
0;"""The most I can say about this product is that it has an interesting label. I had a palm full which left a terrible bitter taste in my mouth for six hours until dinner when it started to go away. I didn't feel so good either. The pieces were very stuck together and some appeared to have very tiny pieces of leaf attached to them. I have purchased several other brands from local natural food stores with no problem whatsoever"
0;I'm eating this right now and I don't think I can finish it.  It tastes nothing like Kraft's regular Mac & Cheese (which I love) -- this is almost inedible.  The cheese flavor is very artificial in the worst way possible.  I don't know how this got past product testing.
0;Their web page on Amazon.com is extremely misleading - it implies that for $12.99 you get a 3-pack when it is actually only a single bottle (single bottles on Amazon are available from other vendors for only $2.99).
0;"""I was really excited to try these cookies when I first saw them in the grocery store. We didn't buy them right away and when I found them offered through the Vine program I was quite pleased. Fig and Honey wouldn't have been my first flavor choice"
0;I am sensitive to high fructose and bought a pack of these with out checking the lable. I was awake all night long after eating those.<br /><br />I can't believe they are still adding HFCS to these when everyone is trying to stop using this harmful ingredient.
0;"""The packaging is convenient.  Single paper/foil tube for one cup of coffee.<br />I followed the simple instructions carefully and produced a 6 oz cup of hot brown liquid with almost no aroma. It did not smell like real coffee or anything else.  The  beverage  was not cloudy and looked like a typical cup of good coffee--no murkiness"
0;Product Packages on the back side of each and every gum pack had a black sharpee mark. I cleaned with acetone and underneath proved to be more than 2 years outdated. Old product will not stick in my mouth. Not healthy to chance
0;"""A BAD mix from a GOOD company. Hodgson Mills makes many good products. This IS NOT one of them. It is NOT the  gluten free  version of Bisquick or any other quick baking mix. There is nothing quick about this. All that is in this product is a few varieties of Gluten free flours. There is no sugar"
0;"""I can't say how the macaron tastes because my groupon order never arrived but I can comment on the companies lack of customer service.  It appears by the other reviewer that I got lucky that the macarons never came but it was completely frustrating that I was waiting for them for a birthday present.  The birthday came and went and finally found out after that the macarons were delivered elsewhere.  I called and emailed Dessert Hub repeatedly"
0;If it were not so much trouble I would return this product. I am a great blue cheese lover but these olives do not contain anywhere near the blue cheese I am accustomed to. The cheese is so mild it might as well not even be in the olives. The olives are OK but to pretend they are stuffed with blue cheese is a grossly misleading statement.  Purchasing this product is a waste of money.
0;"""This product is the same price as a bag of 15 to 20 bully sticks and yours comes 4 in a package for this price.  It was my mistake to not see 4 in a package but I saw instead 12  bully sticks with a photo of a large bag of bully sticks.  Very deceptive.  Why not put a photo of the 4 bully sticks one receives.  I will never buy them from you again."""
0;This gift basket arrived without the message I wrote and when my friend received it she had no idea who it was from.  She told me in no uncertain terms to never buy again from this seller.  She said when she called to find out who the basket was from she was treated very rudely....and she ended up making five calls just to find out who to thank.  I have never had a recipient be angry about a gift before until now.
0;"""My friend loved the gift we send but she had no idea who got it for her. I was curious so I asked her and she mentioned she did get a chocolate basket but there was no card. I will never order from you guys for making that mistake. You are on my  DO NOT ORDER LIST """
0;This a real ripoff. It says is is grapefruit juice but after you order it and get the product. Look at the Label  -- it is ONLY 35% Juice. They should tell you that it only 35% juicce but they hide that fact--<br /><br />This is lying in advertising - it is not really Juice. AVOID THIS PRODUCT LIKE THE PLAGUE.
0;These sugar wafers are awesome.  Perfect sweetness.  The ones I buy in the grocery store are fresh and crispy.  The ones I received from Amazon are towards the end of their shelf life (less than 60 days).  Not as good as the fresh ones in the store.
0;"""The last time I tried Nabisco Pinwheels was after my favorite store closed and I could no longer buy Mallomars (a great choc/marshmallow cookie). Found the Nabisco Pinwheel enormous and fluffy but many of the shells were already broken and I thought the filling had an off flavor like powdered milk(which I detest). Since then I have discovered Dare brand-pure chocolate Whippet cookies that are also sold on Amazon. They are imported from Canada and they are my new favorite choc/marshmallow cookie with pure choc shell and a tasty marshmallow center on top of a quality base cookie or bisquit as the Canadians call it. It's a premium cookie with none of the tricks used by American bakeries these days to fill the cookie with air or other cost cutting measures. It harkens back to the cookies we remembered from our childhoods in the 50's and 60's and the recipe hasn't changed. If you get the craving"
0;"""i ordered certified organic raw cacao powder. i recieved non organic CAROB powder.<br />i don't think they know the difference between the two.<br />i wasted 3 hours of my time baking my cake recipe and when i finished it didn't taste like chocolate cake!i went over to see what went wrong and it was the CAROB.  what a waste of my time and $70 + for the cake ingredients all because of this seller.<br />also i don't even think that the carob i just used is even food grade when i read the label on the back it say   bodybutter ."""
0;"""I ordered this pet food specifically because it said it is 'light'.  My dog is overweight and I ordered this to help reduce her weight.  Nowhere on the bag I received does it ever say 'light'.  I had read the same problem on several other reviews and thought maybe it was just a run of mistakes that were now corrected.  Not!  Still no light - stay far"
0;We have four indoor dogs that ever since they were puppies we have fed them science diet. The main reason was because chicken was the first ingredient. Now I have notice since December our dogs have really started shedding. There fur also is not as soft as it used to be. I just thought maybe they were shedding their winter coat. Well I finally remembered to check the ingredients on the bag this week. Boy was I shocked when I read the first ingredient now. It is no longer chicken on my bag. It is ground whole grain corn. Now if I wanted to feed them that I would buy the much cheaper dog food. So check your bags for the ingredients. I will no longer be using Science Diet.
0;This is one of the most spicy green peppercorns I've ever purchased. They should put down that it is a very spicy peppercorn in their product description.<br />The worst part is that there are no returns on this item and now I'm stuck with this stuff that I can't even use.
0;"""If I would have known this product contained sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate I wouldn't have purchased it in the first place. I didn't even open it. As soon as I read the ingredients I logged on here to return. I ended up going to a health store China Town before this package arrived and found a variety of different ginseng's that came in a pack of 30 and all of them were less than $10! Some had preservatives and some didn't. Not only did I save money but I purchased a safer product compared to this one. I'm not saying this product doesn't work"
0;"""I have used stevia for a few years without ill effects. I was surprised when trying this product recently that I started to get this extremely restless sort of insomnia a few days after I started drinking this product daily. I have had this symptom before from other diet sodas"
0;"""Unless I somehow received a fluke shipment I can only express my extreme disappointment with these tea bags.<br />After letting the tea bag steep for the suggested five minutes I was left with a cup of hot tea-colored water<br />with almost no taste to speak of. The name  Twinings  may conjure up quality tea for most"
0;I too lived in Germany many years ago and found Jacob's coffee to be delicious. I ordered this a few weeks ago remembering the good taste. I don't think that it's 100% coffee that I'm drinking. There's another taste in there ...what is it?  I also see that it's now a 'KRAFT' product?? Also the expiration date is July '11 and it was delivered 3 weeks ago so it must be pretty old. I ordered the beans for freshness but there's probably a limit on that. I guess I'll stick with buying coffee beans locally from now on.
0;"""This was once a very very good tea with lots of full bodied flavor and scent. Then a few years back the corporate suits looked at their bottom line and gambled that there are enough Americans who can't really distinguish good from mediocre"
0;"""Tasted terrible. Had a plastic taste to it. I'm assuming it got that flavor because of the baggie it came in. Bought it to color frosting for my son's cake. It made it a funny color and the frosting had to be thrown out because of the taste. I used a recipe from a good natural foods cookbook to make the frosting"
0;"""I agree with at least one other reviewer here: these crackers taste burnt! Just simply awful. I don't see how anyone can honestly claim to love them. Makes me think that the positive reviews are by the company itself! I'll not be buying them again. If I could give them a zero"
0;"""First let me say that the product itself is excellent and I have no problems with it. This review is mainly about Amazon's idea of proper packaging. I ordered this with super saver shipping and it will be the last time. from now on I will order from another vendor and pay for shipping.<br /><br />When I received the package it was stained and 3 cans had been so severely damaged that they were leaking"
0;"""I recently purchased 5 cases of Wellness cat food and the cans arrived at my home in their securely wrapped cases all dented up.  One of my cats is turning her nose up at this food - she pigged-out on this food when I brought it home from the local pet food store.  These cans"
0;"""Gone through only four cans and it looks like I'm going to have to trash the remaining 20.  Both cats I've feed this to have had massive diarrhea. I've switched canned foods on my cats before and never had this reaction.  One of the cats is an outside cat and will literally eat anything"
0;I bought two bonsai trees from this company thinking I could handle them. I'm usually quite good at working with plants but the two trees this company sent me were determined to die. I followed directions to the letter and was still unable to make them work. Save your cash and look elsewhere.
0;"""I used to by this all the time but had trouble locting a store that carried it. Now I wish I hadn't! The potatoes are made of some foriegn substance and the cheese sause was so saly it almost crunched. My husband has an iron stomach and it even sent him running to the pot! Come to think of it"
0;"""I ordered a box of Wheatena along with a couple of other hot cereals that one just does not find in the major (or minor) supermarkets here in San Antonio.<br /><br />Wheatena was the first of the few that my girlfriend and I tried this morning.  We were both hoping that it would be along the lines of  Ralston "
0;This bully stick is so small!! It's really light. No substance. I returned it immediately. For the price you can purchase at least two smaller bully sticks that will be thicker. My dog would devour this thing in minutes! Do not purchase.
0;I suppose everyone who does gluten-free baking is always searching for the holy grail that would make GF products have the same texture as non-GF products.  This gluten substitute is not worth the effort...save your money!
0;this is the worst tasting pumpernickel bread i have ever tried to eat. we gave it to numerous other people and absolutely nobody would eat it. even the dogs wouldn't touch it my review is minus 100 stars it is the worst of the worst.
0;"""I wasn't able to obtain my usual Hibiscus tea (Ambassador) and bought this thinking it was ONLY what the label said ... Natural Hibiscus.  Who would think I should read the smallest print on the back of a tin of tea for sugar or Stevia.  Well"
0;"""This Tea was just plain awful!! I had Hibiscus tea before and It taste nothing like Hibiscus! I do not understand how someone can leave a positive review!!! It taste like unsweetened kool-aid with a plain taste!!! There is no expiration date on the container.It was sent to me in poor packaging"
0;When I received my shipment one bag was completely crushed.  Surprising since all of the bags were surrounded by packing bubbles.  I contacted the company regarding a return and it took two emails before I received an email back that promised I was receiving a replacement shipment in 3 - 4 business days along with a return label.  That was on November 1st.  It is now November 22nd.  I emailed them one more time last week asking where my replacement order was and have not heard back from them.  I will not be buying from them again.
0;We bought these for our Grand-dog that is a 40 lbs Stratfordshire mix within 5 minutes we took it from because he was destroying it we are sure it would have been gone within 20 minutes and this was the LARGE size one. But he did enjoy it very much you just need to limit the time with the bone if you have a heavy chewer.Just an added note after having these chews for a week now we cannot recommend them because the dog was able to chew off rather large pieces and swallow them causing him to throw-up later that night.
0;I am very disappointed as I checked the description and it said 6.6 lb but I got a package for only 4 lb.. so it was not true and now I only have 4 lb instead of the 6.6 lb I was expecting so I do not recomend any body to buy this as you can receive something different.
0;If u dont believe me look at  where it was manuf... sucks .. i wish i had known sooner .. wouldnt have been eating hersehys candy.. they closed the Hershey plant in PA even.. moved all jobs 2 mexico?? i wondered y hersheys hadnt been tastin right!!!!
0;I am very fond of Yogi Egyptian Licorice tea and when visiting my sister couldn't find it at the grocery store so I picked up the Lemon Ginger which has some of the same ingredients including black pepper. I tried it 3 times but just can't drink it. It tastes like someone ground pepper in my tea.
0;I bought some last week and I thought it was retched! I tried mixing it around in my mouth for a few minutes and it was horrible. for the rest of the weekend I could not get the flavor out of my mouth.
0;product looks good and smells good.  I wish I could say the same about taste.  perhaps mixed with other ingredients ie for no bake cookies.  but as far as peanut butter sandwiches I will pass.  I TRIED IT WITH THE NO BAKE COOKIES AND IT WAS AWFUL.  ENDED UP THROWING THE BEST PART OF THE JAR AWAY. I WAISTED MY MONEY.
0;I was SO excited to discover this product at the local grocery store. I was willing to deal with the outrageous price for zero calorie peanut butter.<br /><br />HORRIBLY disappointed.<br /><br />The flavor is like licking a rusty metal object.
0;I bought this product because I am a big peanut butter fan and I am trying to maintain a healthy weight.  This definitely is not the answer - consistency was awful and taste was terrible - will definitely drop calories elsewhere and continue to eat real peanut butter -  sorry!
0;"""I have to say that I didn't have too much continence in this being a great product but I have been looking for a low fat peanut butter alternative. I am used to having to make some sacrifices in taste for the sake of health. But"
0;I try to be positive about most things. However I cannot endorse or recommend this product. It does not even resemble peanut butter. I even tried it with real jelly and could not cover the bad taste. It has a strong taste but not a peanut butter taste. I can't compare it to anything I have ever tasted.
0;"""I bought this product thinking it would at least taste a little like peanut butter but it doesn't taste anything like peanut butter.  All you taste is a very artificial intense sweetness and a little grittiness.  I wanted to wipe my tongue with a tissue"
0;"""Walden Farms peanut spread is disgusting.  Has the texture of something a sick dog would leave behind and tastes horrible.  It doesn't taste anything like peanuts or peanut butter... provides a mouthful of strange tasting chemicals with a strange texture.  The ONLY good thing about the stuff is that Walmart"
0;I was on Amazon browsing for peanut flour when I saw this come up.  I bought this a couple months ago from our local grocery store.  It. Is. Horrible.  Gross.  Nasty.  Do not buy it.  It tastes nothing like peanut butter and is has almost a greasy texture.  Reminds me of olean or something that is indigestible and just blows through the intestines.
0;I was out grocery shopping when I came across this product. I got really excited to try it and couldn't wait to get home. I love peanut butter and everyone knows how high in calories it is so having a substitue for it made my day! As soon as I got home I made me a bowl of oatmeal and fixed it like I always do with a PB and a little bit of cocoa but I replaced the regular PB with this spread. Its was pretty good...not fabulous but definetly tolerable. A few days down the road I decided to make a PB&J sandwich with this spread......seriously took a bite and gagged. I couldn't eat it!<br /> I would say that it is ok if your mixing it in something but not alone or on a sandwich. I've also tried another one of their products but it tastes gross too. I hate to throw it away because I bought it but I really don't thnk I could stomach it again.
0;"""I researched this as a replacement for peanut butter due to an addiction I seem to have. I did not actually purchase it on Amazon because I saw it one day in the grocery store and thought I was lucky so I grabbed it. I rarely review products but this one was soooo bad I felt the need to so no one else would waste their money like I did.<br />The first thing I noticed was the texture. I thinks it best compares to packaged low fat pudding made with skim milk. I could have gotten past the texture but the smell almost deterred me from even tasting it. It smells like what would happen if the makers of PlayDoh decided to make a peanut or peanut butter version of their PlayDoh. Very odd.<br />So now to the most important thing"
0;This stuff was terrible! I took one spoonful to taste it right after I bought it and then threw it away.  It tasted nothing like peanut butter.  I like the idea of it because even low fat peanut butter still has tons of fat in it... but this was not even edible.  There are other peantu butter options out there that are low in fat but still taste good.
0;"""Okay so I am on a diet and I love peanut butter and wanted to try something that was similar to peanut butter and i knew this wouldn't be too similar to peanut butter but this was completely awful...I even tried adding some sugar to try and get it down"
0;This product for all intensive purposes is a great idea! It smells like a peanut shell. Tastes like nothing...it would have to be an aquired taste to eat this regularly. So I am mixing it with real peanut butter to give volume but to have a better taste with less calories.!
0;"""I didn't buy this expecting it to taste anything like peanut butter. All I wanted was peanut flavor. That's all. What I got was the single most awful thing I've ever eaten. I bought my jar from Sprouts"
0;"""My daughter and I are on low carb diets.  She purchased this product as an alternative to peanut butter.  Don't make the same mistake.  It is unfortunate we cannot assign a negative number of stars.  She sadly bought the Peanut Butter Raisin variety as well.  I hate raisins"
0;"""Did someone in the Walden Farms labs think this tasted good!?  There isn't even a HINT of peanut taste to this dreadful  treat . Walden Farms makes some excellent products but they fell flat on their butts with this one.  The putrid taste is indescribable!  I'd say it probably tastes similar to melted saran wrap.  Ugh!!  Word of advice.  Avoid this like the plague and purchase PB2 instead."""
0;"""The only reason I gave this product one star is because Amazon won't let you give a 'NO' star. I was hoping to find a product that could take the place of peanut butter in my diet. I love peanut butter but it is so high in calories and fat. I should have known better than to think there was something out there to take its place. This stuff was horrible. I can't believe a company would actually produce something so horrendous and take consumers hard earned money for it. I paid $4.99 for it and threw it away after I spit out what was in my mouth.  Shame on you Walden Farms for selling this under the pretense of peanut butter. Even more so"
0;"""Who decided walden farms should sell this product? It's so terrible. The fact they still sell this should be a crime.  Tastes like a packet of splenda mixed with mystery chemicals. Why does it have to be that sweet? It's like they didn't even taste test before this was put on the market. Was this a joke on the consumer or what? I mean it is THAT bad. I told myself I'd eat it because I hate throwing food away"
0;I do buy several Walden Farms products. However this tastes like sweet glue. It never laid next to a peanut. Come on Walden Farms make some serious changes to this product. Many of us can't afford to throw food out!
0;I'm not a picky eater and will try almost anything. To say this stuff is nasty is an understatement.  Whipped vegetable fiber??? I tried twice to eat it and gagged both times.  but is you like it .. go for it.
0;hey guess what! REAL peanut butter has only 200 calories per serving (2 tbsp) AND it doesn't have fake stuff in it. Do yourself a favor and get some natural peanut butter with no weird chemicals or dyes or fillers and just eat that. Then you don't have to worry about what all that weird stuff is doing inside your colon.
0;This has to be the worst tasting stuff ever. So excited to find something peanut-buttery that would not harm my diet that I took out a spoon as soon as I got home. It went right in the trash! I was so disappointed. Now I am going to try PB2. Hope I have better luck... My thought when I threw it out was on what planet did the people in product development think this was a successful product. I guess they are counting on fools like me thinking calorie-free PB would taste good. Definitely they are only counting on one time only sales.
0;"""I love Walden Farms.  I order their salad dressings and syrups in quantity and gladly pay the shipping for the priviledge.  The other day I was in HEB and experienced great joy to see that they carried almost all of the dressings and several fruit spreads.  Then"
0;Dont waste your money on this!!It taste nothing like peanut butter and the texture is weird to say the least.Total waste of money!!If you are looking for a lower calorie or carb peanut butter get better n butter.It is the best!!Taste's just like peanut butter....
0;This fake peanut butter was so totally disgusting that I could not even eat more than a smear on a spoon.  This says a lot because I don't find many foods completely repusive.  It makes me shudder just thinking about it.
0;"""I purchased the product hoping for a peanut butter sandwhich. I was so excited when it came I immediately cut up an apple spead the peanut spread on the fruit and OMG YUCK. It was bitter and had only a hint of a peanut butter taste. I was going to throw it out but decided to try a spoonful in my chocolate/peanutbutter protein shake. Come to find out it gave the drink a better taste. So I have decided to use it in recipies that would normally require peanut butter. Don't order if you are expecting it to taste anything like PB"
0;"""I wouldn't subject prisoners to eat this  peanut butter  as part of their sentence. Even my German Shepard who eats everything (including sheetrock) was nauseated by it. I rinsed out my mouth with raw sewage afterwards"
0;"""The choice between no peanut butter and this  spread  was incredibly easy to make after just one taste.<br /><br />I was prepared for this to not taste just like peanut butter but I wasn't prepared for it to be one of the worst things I have ever tasted.<br /><br />It was only slightly more palatable than the grasshopper I accidentally chomped down on as a child."""
0;2 bites and it went in the garbage... and i only took the second bite to make sure i actually tasted what i tasted... and stirred it and it was still tasted like someone took a dump in my mouth...  i never review products... but this one i had to.
0;This is the first time I have tried any Walden Farms products. If the rest are as bad as this Peanut spread I am not interested in anything they make. It tasted awful and left an after taste that would not go away. I had to brush my teeth to get rid of it. Went straight into the garbage.
0;Nothing could ave prepared me for this. The taste was horrifying! Worse thing i've ever tasted in my life. I was in shock that they'd sell it. I thought for a while maybe I had bought a bad jar. Proves I did NOT. It really baffles me... Would NEVER buy this again.
0;I've tried these before and liked them  buty the boxes I received smelled and tasted rotten or sort of like how paint smells. I think this batch has gone bad or something. And I'm disappointed that I wasted my money. These are going in the garbage it's not safe to eat. So gross.
0;"""hydrolyzed soy protein = a form of MSG<br />Do a quick google search on it. There has been controversy involving the FDA about companies advertising  no MSG  or  no added MSG  when really the MSG is just given a different name under the ingredient listings."""
0;I recieved this yesterday and was very disappointed...  the milk chohcolate was all white spider-web looking and hard as a rock.  It looked as though they were very old although there was no expiration date on the package.
0;Purchased Mauna Loa products for years and never encountered a product like this. The chocolate was a lighter color and did not seem as creamy as previous Mauna Loa products. The color indicated some sort of problem with vendor storage. Wrote email to company but no reply. Will never purchased from this company again. Best quality found direct from factory.
0;This tastes just like brown water. It is lacking flavor and leaves a bland feeling in my mouth after I drink it. Being organic doesn't really make a difference in taste. It tastes worst than the conventional hot chocolate. If I were you I would not buy it.
0;"""This would be a great value if it didn't have petroleum derived chemical artificial flavoring in it.<br /><br />What are they thinking? we won't notice?<br /><br />Wake up Emerald Harmony. WE READ LABELS.<br /><br />If you can't make food without petroleum additives"
0;"""Companies should be ashamed of themselves. These are far from Whole Grain...The 1st ingredient is Organic Wheat Flour...not whole grain! That is the 5th item listed and only provides 1 gram of fiber...Many companies are on the band wagon portraying their products as whole grain goodness and this is because the FDA has not come up with guide lines for whole grains...!<br /><br />Organic Wheat Flour"
0;"""My son has typically loved the Sprout foods and is a very good eater - with the exception of this oatmeal with roasted cinnamon applesauce product.<br /><br />The product is extremely disappointing as the first and main ingredient is Apple Juice and not real apples (though apples do follow in the ingredient's list).<br /><br />Due to the juice content"
0;"""I purchased this to have pasta after being on a ketonic diet for the last month after seeing all five star reviews on a product claiming to have  only 5g of digestible carbs  per serving. I made a box of the pasta and separated it into 8 servings (so less than the suggested serving size). After eating the pasta I started to feel like I just ate a bowl of sugar. I tested myself a few times over the rest of the day (without having eaten anything else) and this pasta skyrocketed my glycemic index and knocked me out of ketosis for the first time in the last month of eating all my carbs from vegetables and nuts.<br /><br />My mistake wasn't googling this product before buying a six-pack"
0;There were bug legs in my product...I was so disgusted I threw up to think if I didn't notice that it would have gone into my fruitcake!!!!<br />This company needs to do something about their QUALITY CONTROL!!!!
0;I am an avid coffee drinker.  I was approached by a sales person for Organo Gold and given a few samples.  I had one of the samples about two hours ago.  I have now been in the bathroom twice and my skin feels feverish.  I do not recommend this product at all.  I will stick with my RaceTrac coffee thank you very much!

0;"""Have to disagree with the previous rating. This product is supposed to be a natural white creamy color and not dark brown last time I checked? Taste was bitter and had lumps of an ingredient in the bottle my guess is a  cloud  mixture that is not properly formulated"""
0;I like kashi products but this was just plain terrible to me. The texture was like ground up and processed cardboard...i really feel bad giving this such a bad rating because i like this company but i have to be honest...this is the kind of product that turns people away from trying to eat healthier. I do think they could have done a better job with this ..mainly the texture ..its not the least bit crunchy dry and if you add milk it just turns to mush instantly. Having said that i'm glad some people like it ..i just dont happen to be one of them.
0;I have purchased Yummy Chummies from Costco in the past and my pups love them.  The bag that I rec'd from Amazon was moldy.  Most of it covered with white and green fuzz.  I didn't want the hassle of sending them back so I put them in the oven and baked them to kill the mold.  That stunk my house up and made the treats hard as a rock.  Two thumbs down and a waste of money.
0;"""My dog was on this food for a while because i like many other people thought the veggies on the bag meant it was healthy but what it really means is their is no substance just corn and wheat gluten and dyes to color the food to make it look like vegetables. Please take it from me"
0;"""We believe it's no coincidence after eating this food for a few months that 2 of my dogs started losing their hair and one died of having (0) blood pressure that was only 6 months old. They were ALWAYS so hungry"
0;That should tell you something about the quality of this product. I switched her to California Naturals immediately after seeing her literally turn her nose up at this brand. She took to CA Naturals and loves the food.
0;I waited many months for this coffee to become available and I am quite disappointed now that it has finally arrived.The taste is okay but there are grounds coming thrugh in each cup. I have used many many different flavors of mostly Green Mountain Keurig coffees as well as other brands and have never before seen a ground come into the cup. I will not buy this Folger brand again.
0;I used to make thes cookies and cover them with powdered sugar.  They were wonderful.  The recipie must have changed because now they are dry and pale in conparison to the former ones.  I am soooo disappointed and will not buy them again.  I suspect the former rave reviews were written about the former product.
0;Let me begin by saying I really like most of the flavors of V8 Fusion juice that I have tried. This one is absolutely HORRIBLE. It tastes like a rotten garbage disposal. I brought 6 of the bottles to my office and everyone that took one home agreed that it was awful. I poured the rest out. Get any flavor but this one.
0;worst excuse for Mocha Java we have EVER experienced in the past 35 years !  Mary and I couldn't have been more disapointed. We aren't coffee snobs...we just love Mocha Java... and this isn't it for us.
0;I was truly disappointed.  If you are looking for Hot Chocolate than order this. There is nothing Chai about this product. Now I find out that this product is not eligible for return.  So I am stuck with 3 bags of hot chocolate.  This makes it hard for me to order other new items from Amazon don't want to waste anymore of my money.
0;MSG is the third ingredient. What was the salt to expensive? I would rather have the real thing than a (flavorless) chemical that sends a signal to your brain that tell you that you taste salt. Plus I could live without the headaches. This stuff is as much gourmet as cheese whiz is French.
0;"""My husband and I visit the Florida Keys quite often. We always make sure that we treat ourselves to some wonderful Key Lime Pie. In the past we have always brought home fresh Key lime fruit from some market in Key West. Due to flight regulations and restrictions"
0;My dog loves to chew!  I figured a product created specifically for dogs that love to chew would be perfect.  Rocky actually ATE this bone.  And then proceeded to throw up pieces of nylabone the next morning.  Horrible!  If your dog is an agressive chewer do NOT purchase this product.
0;If I ever get what I've ordered I know my dog will love it.  Unfortunately that's not happened yet.<br /><br />This is billed as a 'liver' flavor nylabone but twice now I've received the original flavor. Think twice about ordering from this company that cannot be bothered to pay enough attention to detail to give you what you've paid for.<br /><br />They also will not refund your money but only replace the item.  I will continue to send it back until they actually send me the item I paid for.  I wonder how long that will take.
0;"""We've had several nylabones for our dogs.  They loved chewing on them and the bones seemed to hold up very well--until a piece broke off and lodged in the small intestine of my dachsund.  Since it's plastic"
0;"""I would not recommend this product for anyone who cares about  their pet. Apparently the manufacturer of this product does not take measures to insure their product is safe. I ordered the correct size of bone for my Labrador Retriever according to the manufacturers size chart. Brand new out of the package no more than 10 minutes"
0;I have a five month old Puggle. I decided to buy this for her because she's a very aggressive chewer. It seemed durable and long lasting. Nope. Not so much. I gave it to her and she had half of it chewed with in 20 minutes. I do not recommend this chew bone for dogs who are very aggressive chewers. It breaks down too quickly. :(
0;"""This dog food is not at all what I expected. The  meat  in it is some type of processed spongy looking pale colored blob. My dog would not eat this and I can't say I blame her. It does not have anything in it that remotely resembles salmon. It smells awful too. A waste of money."""
0;This had a very miled flavor. Neither my husbund or I liked without adding something to it. There was no cooking instrcutions which meant I had to guess. Boiled like white rice for 30 minutes came out good. I would not buy again.
0;"""Having tried other instant Coffee/K-cups I'd have to say so far this is the worst attempt at French Vanilla that I have encountered. From the other reviews you either like it or dislike it and those that dislike it all have one thing in common"
0;"""I got a keurig machine for my significant other as a birthday gift and got to choose a free coffee pack to go with it at the time of purchase. Later on we both tested it and within a few minutes of trying it my throat started to swell.<br /><br />I have a severe allergic reactions to Red dye #40 including anaphylactic shock from ingesting any amount of it. According to the resources I spoke to Red dye is something often used on nuts as a preservative"
0;"""I have one cat that I adopted and that cat had to do her business in this stuff for the 11 months she was there. She doesn't use it here as I also have the regular clay in the other boxes. Even when the other boxes are full she still goes in the other one.<br /><br />My other cat peed in it and it stunk. Took a while before it soaked up the smell. I think he may have used it one other time. Box has been sitting there now for 6 weeks. They dont use it.<br /><br />They  say  clay is bad. Clay is a natural substance. In fact it's used medicinally (have you ever taken a clay bath to pull toxins out of your body?)."""
0;I bought this product based on online reviews.  I was disappointed that I paid twice as much for this litter than other name brands.  I didn't find that it clumped any better (actually not as good). I found that it was a lot messier than others because if you've ever seen how sawdust spreads you'll know what I am talking about.  I didn't find this cat litter to be better than any of the others I have tried in any way and after reading another review that said it was horse bedding pellets that could be bought at a feed store for $7 for a 40 lb bagged I feel like a sucker.
0;"""I bought this for my 10 year old cat because it was listed on all of the consumer reports as the best and most natural litter you could buy.  Yeah.  Well apparently a great deal of cats are allergic to the oils in pine.  So what happens?  They stop eating"
0;I am a super picky mommy- wanting best for my baby. I was SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS jar. It is pink and doesnt taste like bananas. I tried it and it was not good. From now on I mash a banana with my breastmilk. I do NOT recommend!
0;My 5 month old does not like these at all.  They make her twinge and cringe.  I tasted them and they don't taste like bananas at all.  I do like Earth's best jar food and thought that this was a good deal.  But I think that these jars have been hanging out in a sweltering warehouse somewhere... they are not good at all.
0;"""I purchased two bags. The first one I opened was really bad.....tasted moldy. So I opened the second one and although I still did not like the product because of the curry flavor did not seem moldy.  Maybe sprouted is not a good idea for something that has a shelf life"

0;"""I have tried several coffee k-cups. From Starbucks to Moonlight coffee...virtually every kcup<br />This coffee tastes more like chemicals. No wonder the price is so low.<br /><br />Do not buy this Coffee -- sorry to say !!!  The worst coffee i ever bought and the biggest mistake i did that I bought several ones.... If anyone needs the chemical coffee "
0;I purchased this even after a few other reviewers mentioned that there is a fake sweetener taste thinking it would be ok but the taste is really overwhelming. If you are ok with drinking diet soda you will be ok with these. If not I would stay away. I keep trying to feed these to guest but with very poor luck :-).
0;I tried this and was disappointed. No coffee taste and artificial milk and sweetners. It does not really taste like a cup of cappuchino that you get in a store or restaurant---It is really an artificial made up blend ----stay away or try it at your own risk.
0;"""Terrible flavor.  Watery and weak. Does not compare to the supposedly similar Cafe Express brand of Chai Latte.  DO NOT ORDER *YOU CAN NOT RETURN OR EXCHANGE FOR A BETTER PRODUCT*.  You will not like this"
0;"""This stuff tastes like the  coffee  you get from those vending machines at interstate gas stations or 7-11s.  The first ingredient listed on the box is group of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils.  Doesn't bode well for a supposed cappuccino.  That's followed by multiple"
0;Threw the entire box away.  I thought I was buying Cappichino grade coffee not realizing it was a pre-mixed crappichino. Not only is it premixed but the main ingredients couldn't be more fake and gross. It's a k-cup full of preservatives......YUM.
0;Pure garbage do not even bother to buy this! Tastes like mud in a cup gross. To those who say it tastes like gas station cappuccino...I have no idea where you get yours but by my area they taste great and better than this crap of a kcup!
0;Was so excited to see Cappuccino Cups offered by Amazon....after one sip of this stuff I knew that something was wrong.  It would have been very helpful for there to have been a warning on the box that it contained sucrolose...which is a substance that I do not wish to put into my body.  Very disappointed in this product.
0;I bought this for my daughter and she was very excited to taste it but was very disappointed to find it to be INSTANT cappuccino. It tasted watered down even at the suggested cup setting. We honestly could have got a container of this same stuff at the local dollar store for a lot cheaper and then we could have added more of the powder when needed. Definitely not worth the money.
0;"""Any product with hydrogenated vegetable oils as the first ingredient isn't worth buying.  This stuff has been banned in NY for a reason - it is poison for the human body. See the Wikipedia article on trans fats for more information.  Here is a clip :  Because of these facts and concerns"
0;"""I was excited to find a reasonably priced K-cup coffee.  That is until I purchased it and tried it.  This is instant coffee -it is dishonest to call it a K-Cup.  You expect real coffee whey you purchase a K-cup.  Save yourself the cost - if you really want instant coffee"
0;"""This company is scamming everyone.  They put instant coffee in a k-cup and pass it off as real brewed coffee.  I purchased their Dark roast to try it out.<br />The first thing I noticed was how lite the k-cup felt.  If you shake it"
0;Very excited to order these....but what a disgusting rip-off. I echo the sentiments of those who compared this to the stuff you get at truck stops- overly sweet and a bit oily....plus it is simply powdered mix in your k-cup....if you want this taste (probably a bit better) for like 25% of the cost buy some instant mix at your grocery store and run your Keuring with no k cup and stir.
0;"""Didn't like the flavor or the taste at all...nothing close to any cappuccino I ever had. Totally disappointed and now I am not sure what to do with remaining 52 cups!<br />Don't waste money by buying bulk"
0;I Thought I was order mocha not hazelnut!  Do not care for hazelnut and because it is a groccery Item you can not return it so be very careful on ordering!  The french vanilla is very good and I am sure if you like hazelnut it is also very good!
0;"""I found that Grove Square French Vanilla Cappuchino did not have any pleasant French vanilla or coffee smell. The taste was somewhat medicinal with a bitter aftertaste. Not returnable at Amazon since it is opened and after exchanging emails with the company"
0;"""The only reason this gets one star is because you have to give it atleast that much.  This is not anything like a K-cup.  It is instant coffee in a K-cup wrapper.  There is a supposed guarantee on the box but I have called the number many times and can never get anyone to call me back.  I usually won't bother trying to get my money back on this kind of thing but I have made an exception due to the horrid product.  In the company's defense"
0;This is NOT coffee!<br />It was also not what I expected.<br />No where in the description does it say that it contains hydrogenated oils!<br />I brewed one cup - it looked and smelled like dirty dish water.<br />I threw the entire box out.<br />I want my money back :(
0;"""I highly recommend passing on this stuff--super saccharine taste plus the additional  benefit  of that awful artificial sweetener after taste.  Now what am I going to do with the remaining 23 cups?"""
0;"""I should have trusted the other reviews and stayed away from this. Some reviewers compare this to gas station machine cappuccino but I have had way better  cappuccinos  from gas station machines than this.<br /><br />Edit (10/9/2012) : I now see a ton of 5 star reviews in the last month or two for this trash! The surprise is that all of them are  Amazon Verified Purchase  and most of them are the only review the purchaser has written. If this isn't a case of cooked up reviews"
0;"""I'll keep the box I opened but too bad Amazon won't refund the other 2 boxes. This is truly a cappuccino powder mix stuffed into k-cups.  Caramel sweetness is overwhelming.  Can't taste any  espresso  or coffee.  My first time buying this Grove Square brand and this flavor.  Won't make same mistake again.  Will buy only 1 box to try next time.  Disappointed."""
0;"""I bought six pasty meat pies for $34.94. It took a really long time for them to fill the order and when they did I was charged $40.00 for shipping. I can't beleive that shipping was more than the item. The instructions said to keep frozen until ready to eat"
0;"""I have loved Habitant Pea soup my whole life. When I moved to Philadelphia from Michigan in May I couldn't find it anywhere in the city--thereby increasing my desire for my  former  favorite.  Was delighted to find a way to order it through Amazon.When the box arrived I was struck by how light it was.  When I opened the first can I realized that there were no longer peas in this soup.  It used to be at least half liquid and half the most delectable peas.  You'll laugh at this"
0;I rated this a 1 just because I didn't care for the taste at all.  I have never purchased any raw seeds before and this might just be what it's supposed to taste like but it has a weird aftertaste and I can't get rid of these bags now :(  No one wants to take them off of my hands....
0;"""The fourth ingredient in this candy is ammonium chloride. Too bad I didn't read the label before ingesting this product.  It has been several hours since I ate my first and LAST two pieces of this candy and I still have the sensation and smell of ammonia in my nose.  A spicy dinner and a Neti Pot nasal wash did not remove it.<br /><br />This is one of the worst things I have ever had in my mouth (or up my nose...) and I am heartily glad I bought a single carton at a local store before buying a CRATE at amazon.com.<br /><br />I'm a salty licorice lover.  This licorice is very salty"
0;This is the worse salty licorice I have ever tasted.  My friend is European and turned me on to Salty Licorice and the store we bought from could not get it in stock..  I went into Amazon which i love and always go by the opiions.  I bought this and with shipping was expensive. It tastes like amonia....  I have never tasted anything so bad..  I did get one down....  My European friend spit hers out...  all containers went in the garbage...  I guess $[...] worth with shipping..
0;"""i like black licorice. i like salty licorice. but this double salt is way too much. all you can taste is the salt. and it burns your mouth. i had my order delivered to work and had about 15 people here sample it as well"
0;Always a fan of Licorice.... This one was quite differnt!! Taste like chemical such as Colorox!!! I thought that it was damaged but the 2nd set was just as bad!!!! Thank you Amazon for replacing the first pack but had to toss the 2nd one as well :) Paid $24.00 for nothing. Thanks
0;I prefer soft licorice. I do NOT prefer salt licorice.  At least not licorice this salty.  And I agree there seems to be this note of bleach in the bouquet (if licorice can be said to have a bouquet).  Give me the sweet stuff anytime!  This stuff? Not so much.
0;"""I bought this based on the reviews and I gotta tell you that I was extremely disappointed in the results of this product based on the reviews.  We did not notice little if any change in the taste of things.  I bought  Extremely Sour Candies  from an other vendor to this these with and noticed nothing sweet abou them.  I order 3 packs to give to all my family.  I was so excited to finally get them and the candy.  It was the biggest let down I have experienced in a long time.  So much so that I have ordered from Amazon quite a bit over the years and this is the first review I have written.  The product was that bad.  It left a coating of this candy taste nn my mouth.  The taste turned putrid after about an hour and I had to brush my tongue to get rid of the taste.  This product is not at all what it was advertised to be.  Just a poor gimmick."""
0;"""I would have to agree wholeheartedly with the other one star reviews. This tiny little packet was way over priced and the vendor charged way too much for shipping. They charged $5.98 for shipping an item that they probably could have sent with a single first class postage stamp affixed.<br /><br />I agree with those individuals who said these tablets taste funny and are definitely not sweet.  After dissolving the tablet"
0;I bought this oatmeal at target trying to save some money on my starbucks oatmeal.  The price 1.50 was perfect. Im on a diet so im trying to cut on sugar.  This oatmeal would be perfect if they separated the fruit and nuts from the sugar cinammon to add depending on each people preference.
0;"""Over the years my parents would send me to school and I was just fine until usually either lunch or a snack time with the school or a well-meaning room parent providing grape or fruity colored sugary drinks... or bright colorful candies.. or maybe mom splurged on those bright colorful cereals for breakfast. YUM!  Every kids dream"
0;I agree 100% with the other reviews on this product. Do not buy the Nutramigen with Enflora. It is a rip off and it makes my daughter's colic come back. I heard that they were going to stop making the old formulation and if that is true I don't know what Im going to do!

0;This product tastes nothing like butter and is a waste of money.<br /><br />I contacted the seller and he said he only sells the product and doesn't make it so I should contact the manufacturer.<br /><br />Nice way to run a business. They are totally protected and never will ever take on any responsibility.<br /><br />Beware.
0;My wife and I like strong coffee. Even brewing this at twice the recommended amount it tasted weak. There may be subtle tastes and flavors involved but there just was not much coffee taste. The experience is more like drinking tea.<br /><br />The only plus is that there is not any bitterness.
0;"""I bought this product n hopes of an easy and less expensive way to make crab cakes. It always takes so long to crack the crab open and the cost of fresh crab is also a drawback.<br /><br />When I opned the product is was almost as minched as tuna. no crab chucnks and it had a bad seafood smell. I tried opening another can and the same thing. I was to leary to make the crab cakes out of this product (we were having company over) so I had to run to the store and buythe real crab to be safe.<br /><br />I was hoping this would be good"
0;I didn't look closely when I bought it and thought I was buying another brand. The smell of these is so fishy that I couldn't stand it and gave the rest away. I took the opportunity to get my three cats off of wet food.  They ask for it but it's not there and I give them Temptations Treats instead and they are happy.

0;"""I have drunk a pot of Twinings Earl Grey tea every morning for the last 15 years (family favorite).  However in the last year & a half I've noticed a terrible change in the taste of the tea.  The Earl Grey that I knew & loved was fragrant & never bitter unlike the new stuff sold today.  At first I thought it had bought old tea or a bad tin.  I even switched stores & finally bought it here on Amazon.  But same bad taste.  Several members of my family also complained about the change as well as friends who were longtime drinkers.  I googled Twinings Earl Grey & have discovered that there was indeed a switch about 2 years ago.  I cannot recommend this new stuff at all--it is not remotely similar to the Earl Grey of old.  It's bitter"
0;I was looking for that extra something as a joint gift to my grandparents. I got them individual gifts but it did not seem enough so I got this for them as well. When they opened it they seemed excited about the gift and looking forward to seeing the contents. I then asked them later how they liked it and my grandmother said it was no good and the candy was stale. Well that was embarassing. I love buying Christmas presents and finding unique and fun things for my loved ones. I dont get to do a lot for my family normally like most people on a tight budget. I feel let down by the company and sad that the point of the gift wasn't able to be achieved. I would not buy this again and would sadly not be able to recommend it. I think it is a neat idea but the quality of the candy was no good.
0;I love olives. I love Cora's olives. These are AWFUL. I am really bummed - I bought 3 packs because I love all the other olives by Cora. I haven't been able to find one person to eat one without spitting it out. They are extremely bitter.

0;While the product is fantastic i do not recommend ordering from Cosmetic Solutions.  The product i received did not match the product description.  This was supposed to be a Christmas gift so i called the co. and complained.  I was told i could return the product i received or take a $5 refund.  They could not send me what i ordered as they do not have it in stock!  BIG dissappointment!

0;I bought these for my family with respect for Quaker and did not scrutinize the label.<br />They are filled with junk! High Fructose Corn Syrup is the second ingredient and brown sugar the third. They are so filled with junk ingredients that they have 43 carbs per bar with 38 in simple non-complex blood sugar raising carbs.<br />I've decided to feed these to the livestock down the road and not my family. Shame on Quaker. I will stick with the breakfast bars by Nature Valley and Kashi instead. Shame on Quaker. Childhood and adult obesity are epidemic. Oats are healthy except when slathered in high fructose corn syrup and junk carbs. Again Shame on Quaker.
0;This is a sweet I order every time I see it on menus in the UK - but the canned version is just not the real deal- the topping is runny rather than gooey and the cake is too loaded with strange chewy bits of fruit- if you want to try it I have a couple of cans (ordered in my enthusiasm of finding it online) that I can sell you cheap...not good
0;This sauce is way too sweet!!  Can't think of a worst way to ruin an otherwise perfect pizza.  I prefer to make my own homemade pizza sauce and freeze it in single-serving bags so its always available when needed.

0;My bull terrier loved this toy. It's long lasting and the only toy that my dog didn't destroy in 10 minutes. I thought it was great until he came down with a fever and intense diarrhea and a low grade fever after getting a piece of it out of the toy.  The vet said that it was recalled a few years back but couldn't find out why. She said to stay away from any pet things made in China as there are no regulations on the making of them.  I won't be giving them to my dog - please be warned and make an informed decision before buying it.
0;The liver product stained the beige carpet.  I would not recommend this flavor. We have tried all kinds of stain remover but to no avail.  Save yourself a lot of head aches and a major problem with ruining your carpet.

0;This is ridiculous - I shop Amazon all the time and I am definitely pro-Amazon but the price on the package of Thomas English Muffins is insane - $6.95 for one package of 6.  You can purchase a pack at Walmart for $2.  Who would pay this price?<br /><br />Amazon you get it right 99% of the time and are spot on but maybe not on your food prices.

0;The aroma of the Hartz Smoked Pork Bone is just downright memorizing-even tempting the taste buds of humans. That's about the extent of the reasons I like this product. This splinters BADLY!! My 75 lb Dalmatian ate one last night @10pm and today @ 5pm he vomited shards of the bone (which was a lot) and everything else he ate that couldn't pass as a result of these bone fragments blocking the passageway of his intestines.

I had her to the Vet within an hour and $354.32 later learned that this Hartz  Premium  bone for  aggressive chewers  tore up her intestines.  She is now on 3 medications and a special diet for the next week.  The vet advised me to contact Hartz to let them know what happened.  I plan on doing that AND sending a copy of the bill.  I don't expect them to pay it (they'll likely file it in the circular file) but they need see it and hear about it. I purchased these Hartz  Premium  bones for  aggressive chewers  from Walmart so did not have the advantage of the WARNING reviews on Amazon. You do.  Don't do this to your dog."""

0;"""I received my case (12 bags) and every bag was as solid as a rock. I opened 2 bags immediately and some of the beans did separate but most did not. I now have sticky feeling beans in with jelly bean clumps. They do taste okay (not great) and certainly not at all what I had hoped after reading two glowing reviews. Next time I'm going for the lifesaver jelly beans"
0;"""I had previously purchased this Pedigree chicken dog food for my finicky 1-year-old german shepherd and she loved it.  When my shipment arrived from Amazon I immediately opened a can from the end of the plastic-encased 24-pack and presented it to my dog.  She sniffed it and refused it"
0;I love Brachs butterscotch & they are so hard to find so when I found them in my local albertsons I was ecstatic. Well that was short lived because the original Brachs butterscotch that has the yellow wrapper with blue writing no longer exists!! The new version sucks!! The taste is different as well as the texture and I hate them! Ill never understand why companies feel the need to change products that are not broken. I'm very upset bc the original was amazing and anyone who loved them will notice the horrible change in the new version. Bad move Brachs!!
0;"""Well I purchased this item to give away at trade shows my company attend. While I was expecting a bucket of 3 different flavors. I received a bucket of the original flavor. As I chatted with a rep from amazon.com"
0;It certainly didin't taste a thing like the chokecherry jelly I had growing up in N.Dak.  No tanginess.  I don't thingk there was any real chokecherry juice used. I was very disappointed as I got one for me and one for a Christmas gift for my brother.
0;"""I used to buy these in bulk and finally great tired of finding dried glue caked on the elbows in the box.  I've had the same problem with the shells from Annie's.  I contacted the company about this problem 3 times before receiving a brief reply informing me that I had nothing to be worried about and that the glue caked to the pasta in the box was not toxic.  Forgive me if I don't take anyone's word on that"
0;This macaroni and cheese product was advertised on line as Gluten-free<br />Main ingredient is wheat. Couldn't get Amazon online to Complain about it.<br />Ended up throwing all 12 boxes out in the trash. Didn't have room on the shelves for a product that would poison me.
0;"""I don't know if I've ever hated a product more...I bought this because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about with the new coconut water fad. OMG. This stuff tastes like grass. It isn't sweet at all"
0;I cannot eat popcorn. I was looking for a suitable substitute. I thought these might do the trick after reading the reviews. Had to throw them away. Other people may like them but for me they taste pretty much like stale cardboard. Worst snack I have ever tasted.

0;I ordered what I thought was 1.2 lbs in this 6 pack.  My cat loves this product.  That should work out to be 18 oz or 3 oz per bag.  I got 2.5 oz per bag or a total of 15 oz (3 oz short or a whole bag). My low rating is based on what I ordered vs what I actually received.  Shame on that seller!!!!
0;"""I purchased this based on the rave reviews. I am thinking that either I got a bad batch or a lot of people just love the taste of flavorless oil. I am not a picky person. If this even remotely had a good flavor I would have been fine with it. But everyone who tried it agreed that it made the popcorn taste worse and not better and added almost no flavor at all. I wish I could have tasted the product before I purchased it. So"
0;"""This product contains partially hydrogenated soy bean oil.  Partially hydrogenated vegtable oils are trans fats.  Trans fats are artifical fats that health professionals agree are unhealthy and should be vigorously avoided.  Trans fats are not normally found in the human diet to any appreciable degree.

Now it is in the trash.<br /><br />For your healths sake"
0;"""I read the other reviews thinking this would be a great way to give my son something other than Cheerios while we are out and about. These things are so hard it is ridiculous. I can barely break them into small pieces. I have had various kinds of dried fruit and this is by far the worst. The taste is absolutely horrible. I have bought a ton of stuff from Amazon"

I've had the Red Rain energy drink before and thought it wasn't bad but the energy shots were awful.  Not only did they have a terrible taste but I didn't notice any energy boost at all from them.  I typically feel a small surge from the 5-Hour brand.  Don't waste your money on these"
0;"""Let the buyer beware! These are not individually wrapped tea bags which are what led me to fall in love with Taylors of Harrogate Earl Grey.

0;"""When you first receive this basket you think wow this looks great.  However once you open it you start to realize how not great it is.<br /><br />1.  The most weird thing about this basket is that they items have been repackaged.  There is a box of carmel corn the cover made it look like it was a fake version of the item.  When you open it up you are even more suspicious b/c the caramel corn is inside a wheat thins box! huh? many of the items are similarly repackaged this way.  I would never send someone a basket that is so obviously homemade instead of a legit company.<br /><br />2.  many of the items were so small.  Inside was a tiny box of jelly beans"
0;Purchased $28 worth of Hostess Lemon Fruit Pies from this company and they all expired 3 days after they arrived.  You may want to ask for the expiration date of the products you purchase from this company.
0;Even adding other fruit to this product doesn't make it taste any better.  I was hoping it would.  The aftertaste is even worse.  I've treid plain coconut water and didn't like it.  I don't like this either.
0;I tried two different flavors of Vita CoCo Coconut water both had a plastic taste that i didn't like.When one arrived it had the plastic cap broken off but it still had the foil seal so i felt safe drinking it.Glad i just tried  one of each flavor.

0;This is probably some of the worst tasting waters I have ever tried. It almost tastes like something spoiled. Do not buy this at any price. What a complete waste of money.I wish there were minus ratings.
0;"""It tastes . . . how to put this . . . gawdawful.  There's very little fruity flavor - it actually tastes more salty than anything else.  They need a little more attention to quality control as well.  On two (make that three - no wait"
0;I am open to almost anything but this stuff is the worse thing I have ever tasted!!!  It is nasty and I have yet to taste any fruit flavor...just plain gross...even tried adding a bit of Stevia and that did not help...really made it worse...Rihanna can have this!!!
0;This is the worst taste for a drink ever? Its a bitter spoiled taste (to my best description  Now i'm stuck with a whole box to pour down the drain!!! Do not buy!  Just buy the regular 100% pure coconut water flavor.
0;These are really bad tasting even when they are cold.<br /><br />I tried these 1st time from stop and shop but they weren't tropical fruit mix just one fruit only which is grate<br /><br />so thinking thing these will be just as good mistake I hate these<br /><br />DO NOT BUY Tropical fruit mix pack those are bad just one fruit is good.<br /> Hope this help.

0;"""I do not like the new recipe at all. They messed with a good thing. There is plenty of chocolate that tastes like the  new  recipe already. Bland and waxy. You just lost a long time customer Lindt."""
0;This used to be one of my favorite chocolate bars before they ruined it with soy lecithin.  I've been reading the other reviews and I'm really happy to see so many people saying the same thing.  My wife sent an e-mail to Lindt and they wrote back saying they had done extensive market research and had gotten positive feedback on the new recipe.  I have a very hard time believing that.<br />I have found some good alternatives but they more expensive.  Michel Cluizel 72% Noir de Cacao is very good but not as easy to find and about twice as expensive as the Lindt bar.  I hope Lindt will come to their senses and change it back.
0;"""I've read all the reviews of this product and I feel I must add my name to the chorus of negative reviews on the new recipe.  I can't express how disappointed I was with the new recipe.  I started eating dark chocolate about 12 years ago.  I started with sharffen berger which is quite good chocolate.  I tried various brands.  I wanted the healthy dark but wasn't interested in eating 85% because I wanted to balance flavor with health.  That is where the old recipe of this 70% bar was perfect at.  It tasted better than the Sharffen berger to me and every other bar I had tried.  Now they take this wonderful bar and ruin it for poorly thought out reasons.  I still had a bar of the old when the new came out and I did a blind taste test in my family of four.  All thought the old was better than the new.  So Lindt's marketing machine is doing itself a great disservice by continuing to perpetuate the lie that most people actually like the new recipe.  Note that in my grocery store I can still find the 1.2 oz bars as of August 2011 that are labeled Intense dark.  These bars are still made in france and have no soy products in them (although they say it may contain  traces  of soy beans but all chocolate products say that due to the factory environment in which they are made).<br /><br />For me at least money is no object for this purchase and I'm not rich.  Just trying to prioritize good food over other things in my life.  I would gladly pay the higher price if the exchange rate was the issue or if the ingredients were the issue.  The bottom line is the new recipe is horrible.  Don't purchase if you like chocolate.  If you like wax just buy a candle and eat that."""
0;Lindt 70% was easily the best dark chocolate on the market. We tried the new recipe ...once. That was it. I emailed customer service and they said their marketing showed that the new stuff would sell better. And they sent me a coupon for more Lindt.<br /><br />They lost a customer.
0;I used to looooove this stuff until they changed the recipe. Now it is waxy and kind of tastes like Hershey's. And it also tastes less like chocolate. Skip this chocolate and buy something else. Not worth the money.
0;We ordered two jars of these cooked and peeled chestnuts.  The vacuum was opened on one bottle and we tossed it out.  The seal on the second jar was OK but the chestnuts were mealy.  We tossed it out.<br /><br />I think we should get our charges refunded.
0;"""This green tea is the worst I have purchased. I don't understand the good reviews. This has a smoke taste. It is not smooth or light at all. Lipton original green tea tastes better than this. This does not taste organic. At first I thought it was Lipton in a different package"
0;"""I bought this with the thought that it would be healthier and I am trying to lose some weight...I would rather eat glue...The texture and sweetness level...Terrible! I am a sugar freak and it made my throat hurt"
0;"""I tried this oatmeal. It was too  natural  for me.  I don't like the flax and found the flavor to be bland.  If I wanted my food to taste like that I would buy bulk horse feed from the feed store down the street."""
0;"""The items were so dry - they could not be formed around the pills.  I've previously purchased these at my Vet's office and they were great.  My  Buddy  Beagle has a problem taking large pills and capsules but had no problem eating those!"""
0;I'm the account holders wife....I bought this based on the good reviews.  I was disappointed. I made a batch of it and it was so bad I wouldn't even feed it to the livestock and they usually get all our scraps. The consistancy of the noodles was horrible and I followed the instructions and I even rinsed it.  I have made lots of spaghetti over the years and this one was the worst.  I'm going back to rice flour spaghetti.
0;We love the strawberry Twizzlers and buy them quite a lot.  I was so excited to see the sugar free ones at Walmart.  We bought it and they tasted pretty good (were expensive though).  A short time later we started with gas and running to the bathroom.  It's been 24 hours now and we're still having the gas and believe me it's major gas...you sure don't want to be away from home.<br /><br />I would not recommend this candy to anyone.
0;"""Ordered this item as I am a diabetic.  Decent tasting but absolutely indigestible. Caused major gastrointestinal distress.  Found hidden behind the fold a very subtle understated advisory that some individuals may experience a  laxative  effect.  Excuse me but this was way beyond  laxative  and lasted more than 18 hours!  This could replace the pre-colonoscopy medicine Miralax. Wait I might be on to something here! At least the the pre-op procedure would taste good.  I subsequently went back to the site and looked at the customer reviews and learned I am not alone in this experience.  Amazon needs to clearly advise customers of this potential in their product description.  Until they do I would hope they refund people who buy it  If you decide to try it after reading this"
0;"""I was happy to find these in my local weis supermarket as I had never seen a sugar free option for the twizzlers and they are my favorite snack. I am very strict about eating the indicated serving size. I loved the taste"
0;I have been using another organic sesame oil for awhile and it has never smelled this one smells burnt it's unpleasant. I called and they sent another that smelled the same might be a good products but i dont lile the smell
0;I went into K-cups to order K-cups.  This product didn't have an image and I didn't read the product carefully - after all I went into K-cups - why would there be another product in K-cups or why wasn't there an image.  Also didn't read that this item is nonreturnable.  Now I have coffee that I can't use.  Lesson learned - don't order when there is no image available and read the fine print!
0;"""I am disgusted that they are allowed to get away with tricking people. There is no actual truffle used in this product but they do everything they can to convince you that there is. The ingredients say organic sunflower oil and white truffle extract. Extract makes you think it was extracted from real truffles"

0;When I recieved the herring it was warm. I opened the jar and the fish was warm and mushy. There was also not a lot of herring in the jar. It wouldn't be a good buy even if the herring was edible. I threw it right into the garbage.<br />This product should not be shipped if it can't be protected from spoilage.
0;I was given this product as a Christmas Gift.  Lets just say this is the nastiest tasting imitation of a latte I have ever had.<br />It leaves a terrible after taste must less taste like coffee.  Don't waste your money on this product.
0;"""Ok...I was invited to one of those Organo Gold mixers by a co-worker...throughout the presentation it just smelled like a pyramid scheme (a turn off)...my belief is that if the product is so good it would be available for the masses...in every store on every corner.  I have tasted both the mocha and latte and they actually taste the same nor have I noticed a  surge  in energy...I am pretty active already"
0;"""How can any coffee (latte) with the primary ingredients of sugar and non dairy creamer which is actually hydrogenated oil be marketed as healthy? In order to have a therapeutic dosage of ganoderma (lingzhi)"
0;This is not worth it.  My pit ate it in large chunks in under a minute.  i bought it locally for what i'd pay for dinner- not worth it in terms of money or time in keeping him busy.  he takes longer to eat an entire bowl of food..
0;I bought a 12 pack of the Neuro Sleep based on reading reviews of the product.  Silly me...should have walked away.  This products has a pleasant taste but doesn't do diddly squat for helping me get to sleep.  This was an utter and complete waste of 30 some dollars for the 12 pack.
0;"""BUYER BEWARE!!!<br />The picture is of a 6oz can - what you will receive is a case of very expensive 3oz cans! It is hard not to think of this as false advertising since what is pictured is not what you are buying. I will be checking to see Amazon's policy on this type of  soft-fraud  by [...]. Anyone who buys this brand of cat food knows that it is pricey"
0;THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE WORST CEREALS OF MY LIFE IT IS SO DENSE YOU CAN BARELY SWALLOW IT. TOO MANY CALORIES IN SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT OF CEREAL.  THEIR OTHER CEREALS ARE ALOT BETTER EVEN IF THEY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SUGAR.
0;I thought that there was suppose to be 12  5 ounce bags but there is only one! This is a rip off price when you include shipping price! How are you saving 29 dollars when there is only one bag? Not to mention the gummy worms are really fat and not long as normal gummy worms. I am highly disappointed.
0;"""The one good thing that I can say about this mix is that it does produce a very large amount of soup. That's the only good thing that I can say. I have had this soup many times while living on Long Island. Been to Chinatown in NYC many times and<br />I can tell you this mix absolutely does not taste anything like Hot & Sour soup. I currently live in Orlando and have been here for about 10 years. I find this soup is inconsistent among the various Chinese restaurants here"

0;I bought this product thinking it was a high quality demi glace. It is an ordinary brown gravy which would be wonderful if served in a high school cafeteria or budget restaurant. There is a reason it is well priced. You get what you pay for. Be sure you know what you are ordering before you buy this.
0;our one year old seal point siamese smelled this cat food.  turned up her nose and walked away.  I left in down for one day.  She would not even touch it.<br />Donated this cat food to local rescure shelter for animals.
0;No instructions on packaging that I could find. So first I put a pod into K cup machine. This is NOT for K cup machines. No taste. I do brew tea bags in same machine with great results.<br /><br />Then I put a pod in a cup and covered it with hot water and let steep quite a while.  Weak. Not my cup of coffee.

They both enjoyed EVO and the ingredients are very similar to what is in CORE.

Needless to say my male cat has developed  struvite crystals and a nasty UTI this past month.We were at the vets 4 times this month alone until I just by chance saw a article about Wellness doing this to male cats and informed my vet 2 days ago about this. We were stumped as to why our cat still had a high ph and crystals after two weeks of antibiotics"
0;"""I switched my cat over from a non-grain free food to this food because I wanted to start going the grain free route. Not long after I started mixing in this food with the old food he started throwing up more and more frequently (aside from the fact that he obviously did not like the smell of it). I cut this food out and he's stopped getting sick. Thank goodness it didn't get as bad as some other reviewer's experiences"
0;I bought this coffee based on all the positive reviews and the significantly cheaper price than my usual brand.  I find this coffee lacking any Hazelnut Creme flavor.  Perhaps the lack of flavor is due to the fine grind?  Needless to say I will not be purchasing this coffee again.

There are many brands which are simply wonderful - unfortunately this one is not!<br /><br />The flavor is NOT rich and figgy - it tastes diluted and flat.  The consistency has too much gelatin in it so it is NOT smooth and creamy as it should be.<br /><br />I keep my fig preserves in the refrigerator for AGES - and they never"
0;"""I am very disappointed in this green tea.  I bought it to use in protein shakes and it creates a grassy aftertaste that is not at all pleasant.

0;I bought this rice (for $9.98)expecting to receive 10 5oz bags for the price.  The same thing in most stores cost $1.50 max.<br /><br />Luckily Amazon gave me a full refund (even though you are not allowed to return food).<br /><br />I would not buy this product via Amazon again.

0;I've purchased this product at pet stores before and the filets are moist and have a nice texture. I recently opened my filets and they were dry and stale even though the expiration date states April 2013. I recommend you purchase at a local store so you can return if you have a similar issue.
0;"""I was excited to try this tea as I love both matcha green tea and chocolate.  I do not like this product.  I usually order my matcha from Matcha Source out of LA and I guess I have been spoiled because the quality of this green tea seems low and combined with the  chocolate  flavor is undrinkable to me.  I will be using the rest of the bag in smoothies and hope it will drown out this awful taste."""
0;"""I bought these because I make mashed potatoes so infrequently and was tired of wasting real potatoes (buying a bag and not using them all before they went south). My local grocer did not have a great selection so I got these based on the name and was really disappointed. They are gummy and have no taste"
0;"""I could just bawl.  This is just one of my favorite products that have been discontinued or  improved  in the last couple of years.  I loved Potato Buds for thirty years and I will never buy them again"
0;"""I have noticed it seems to be getting harder and harder to find Potato Buds.  This new recipe is totally bogus.  I have contacted Betty Crocker and asked about Potato Buds being discontinued and I was told they had no plans to discontinue them.  What they failed to say is that they have completely discontinued the best instant potatoes in the world and are now selling some gummy"
0;I am in my fifties and grew up on Potato Buds. My mom was an excellent cook but in a pinch she used the (ORIGINAL) BC Potatoe Buds and boy were they good!  I bought a box recently thinking they were the same.  Not!!!!  These were a gummy mess!  I had to add a lot of extras just to make them palatable.  Do not buy!  Switch to Idahoan for good instant potatoes!
0;Nearly $8 for a little tin of curry powder? Amazing.<br /><br />Either make your own (many recipes online) or buy another brand in an Asian grocery store or online for $2 or so.<br /><br />And Malaysian curry powder is VERY different from Indian or other curries. If a recipe calls for Malaysian curry powder get the real thing or the taste will be very disappointing.
0;I never thought it was possible that my cats would turn away from wet food but they will not eat this stuff.  We've been feeding them Purina wet food and they absolutely LOVE it.  I took a chance with this Instinct food and now I'm stuck with 23 cans.
0;"""I don't know how ANYONE could rate this so-called  cat  food above a 1 star - it is CRUD.<br /><br />The food is cheap - stuffed full of fillers. My 4 cats prefer to eat old and dried up Fancy Feast crumbs before they even eat a bite of this junk. It comes out of the cans like a hard lump - the liquids drain out and you end up with a brick that has to be broken apart.<br /><br />Well"
0;I am very disappointed in this product.  I regularly order Peruvian organic from Gevalia.  I was looking for something cheaper.  This definitely tastes cheaper!  It has that dime store coffee quality.  It is very bland w/a yucky aftertaste.  I was also hoping for something more acidic.

0;This is the second time to purchase rio Rancho bowls... we liked the flavor so well...however on both occassions bowls were broken... the first time 3out of six... this last time five out of six... so broken we just had chips!...<br />While many would say..is it the manufacturers problem.... the question is..how do other companies package shells without breaking...<br />No company website and no response from a written letter sooo I would say I am done with rio rancho... they are now called rio raunchy in the way they handle client complaints..<br />parker ..stillwater ok

0;I was very disappointed in this item. Upon opening the Bag I could smell that the nuts were stale.It appears to be the peanuts. The expiration date was June 2010. I believe the packaging needs to be changed. It also says no salt. However there are 50 mg of salt in a serving.
0;I was so excited to get this after reading some really good reviews.  It tasted sorta chocolately at first and then the after taste hits.  It was horrible and I could still taste it a half hour later.  Very disappointing!
0;This product contains artificial sweeteners.  The smell when it is being cooked or even when it is still dry is overwhelmingly unpleasant and chemical-ish. The artificial sweeteners are VERY obvious in the taste. I bought to keep at work for when I forget a meal but it took me a long time to finish and I wont buy it again because of the chemical smell and taste.  Right now the empty bowl smells strongly of syrupy sweetener and that was after I dumped a tablespoon of peanut butter in it to cover it up.  I like to keep Quaker instants for hurried days but I will not buy this line again.  It just tastes and smells... odd.

I only taste vingar really. What a shame and a waste of money. I tried 2 cans and let my mom finish them off. Well i actually made her take them home but she tossed them. Do not even buy even for 6 cans for $5. If you get these for free well it helps you live but you will not enjoy the taste.

0;This is a poor excuse for a gopher trap. I have lots of gophers and have used other traps. I recently bought 8 (four sets) of these traps. They are ill designed.

The problem is the sweep of the pincers is too wide and the mechanism too easily clogged with sand or dirt. Don't bother with these traps.

0;I've used Innova Dry Adult Food Large bites for years and my four dogs all did well on the food. The company was bought out in the last year or so by a larger company.  They just recently changed the formula to include a bunch of new items and my dogs can no longer eat it.  Two of the four of them immediately developed a lot of gas and then started to itch within days of giving them the new bag of food.

0;PURCHASED AT AMAZON VERY BAD PRODUCT! TASTE LIKE VINAGAR WATER.DURKEE BUTTER FLAVORING.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.VERY SORRY I WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.CAN'T BELEIVE DURKEE PUT THEIR NAME ON THIS PRODUCT.
0;I was very happy to find that this water was available for order. I ordered a dozen and ordered 3 dozen more. My first box was just delievered a half hour ago and the seals were broken on several bottles. Th order was also missing 2 bottles! I suspect warehousing was thirsty??? I even signed up for a monthly save subscriptons to have them mailed to me every month going forward. I  am so disappointed right now!! The other three dozen were shippe to me today but the rep was great in having contacted UPS to return the order to them. He candelled the subscription and told me to expect a refund 2-3 days after the orders are returned to the warehouse.
0;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM AMAZON!!!! The waters comes very poorly packaged and i guarantee you will have broken bottles. I received two packages (36 bottle total) and only 1 bottle survived the shipment.
0;I received them only to find out that they were stale and old.  I have purchased them individually at GNC so I am familiar with how they should taste and feel and these could hardly be bitten into.  VERY DISAPPOINTING!
0;I enjoy this gum but this is one of those purchases where you get three flavors and one is clearly the favorite and you don't want to chew the others.  Also if you are not using this for little league or something like that you might find yourself unsure what to do with 300 pieces of gum.
0;I have to say I am very disappointed in this deal. The merchant claimed he couldn't get a box from post office by the end of holidays. Now it's been more than two weeks after the holidays but the product was still not sent out. Made me think the merchant wasn't quite honest in this whole thing.
0;I was happy to see another grocery store option for Stevia that seemed to be price a bit lower. My taste buds do not find it very sweet unless I use a lot more that plain stevia. The label says it measures cup for cup like sugar however I think one would need a 3:1 ratio on the sweetness scale.<br /><br />This was my first and last purchase of Pure Via. It may be my taste buds but I think it is a big rip off. - Dot
0;"""Horrible aftertaste! Perhaps I added too much (4 packs) but it was absolutely not edible. I couldn't even drink my morning coffee when I added this. I switched to Truvia and it was MUCH better. Generally"
0;I ordered ten vanilla beans from this company.  when they came in the mail they were so dried out they would snap in half.  there was no way to use them at all.  It took several emails and three weeks to finally get a replacement sent.  Not happy with halaleveryday at all.  Would never order from them again.
0;I drink Starbucks coffee at home each morning.  I like a strong bold cup and therefore usually brew the darker roasts.  I am not a huge fan of flavored creamers but on occaision I will get a vanilla flavored coffee at a bagel shop.  I was excited to see Starbucks new line of flavored coffees because I assumed the quality would be just as good as their regular coffees and that the premium price would provide a genuine good hint of vanilla flavor.  I was deeply dissappointed in the strong artificial vanilla smell and taste when I brewed this coffee.  I couldn't even drink it with my 1/2 & 1/2 in it. It was worse than any gas station flavored coffee or instant vanilla coffee beverage I have tried.  The aftertaste was terrible and I had to throw away the remaining coffee.
0;"""I am one of the biggest Starbucks fans and have tried nearly every blend of coffee bean they have.  While I am not a huge fan of flavored coffees due to the nature of the artificial flavoring they add when Starbucks came out with ALL NATURAL Fusions I was intrigued.<br />I have tried all three blends they offer: cinnamon"

It's not the most expensive brand nor is it the exotic nature of the coffee that is my snobbery. I love a good strong cup of coffee. To me coffee is a experience for all your senses. This failed.<br /><br />The first moment the bag was in my hands I smelled it"
0;We got this Vanilla coffee hoping it would be a good coffee. Hubby brews the pot as one of those lovely breakfast in bed scenes. Smells good as it's perking in the pot. I smell the cup when he places at my bedside table. I cannot describe exactly what I was tasting...Perfume...Chicory...something not so good. Down the drain it goes. Thinking we might need to make it stronger....maybe it will taste good this time??? NOPE. Down the drain. Rinse pot. Add our usual Starbucks Beans for the next pot in anticipation of a good cuppa and it still tastes like the awful vanilla. I've had to send the pot through its clean cycle now. Tomorrow we will try our regular beans again and hopefully we won't be reminded of that awful vanilla.....
0;UGH!  I had just discovered the rich roasted with slight vanilla flavor and then I buy a second bag and was shocked to see the light roast of any cheap flavored coffee.  I called in to their customer service and of course they didn't know what I was talking about.  I love Starbucks for the rich bold roast and now this new version is just like the Dunkin Donat or other flavored water that they pass off as coffee.  I realize they are probably trying to get those customers that like crappy brown water but come on Starbucks remember your BRAND IDENTITY!!!!!

0;This product does not work.  I could spray this stuff directly on the cats and have no reaction.<br />I buy many things on Amazon and hope they take notice and remove it.  I have no problems with the dealer that sent it.  It came very fast after ordering.  As far as I am concerned it is water in a spray container.  No negative star ratings that this deserves.  LESS THAN ZERO STAR RATING.

0;I purchased this package of Milky Ways a few months ago and if I had written my review then I would have given it 4 stars. I paid $17.96 at the time. That came to $4.49 a bag and they are nice large bags. If it wasn't for the length of time it took to ship I would have given it 5 stars. Now it's more than doubled in price and comes to $9.00 a bag. I find that a ridiculous price and a very steep increase in such a short period of time. These bags are large but they are not that large. Do yourself a favor and buy them at Walmart or your grocery store.

0;This bag of salt came in a box from amazon.  When it arrived I opened the box and it was full of salt.  The bag had a slit in the side.  I will never use a product like that.  I contacted the company and they were no help. They told me to contact amazon.  I had been on vacation and it was passed the time limit to return the product to amazon.  I think it was very poor customer service from the company not to replace the bag for me.  I am a brand new customer with this product and was excited to find celtic sea salt because i had read it was good for your health.  I am a  business owner and i know to keep a new customer I would have gone out of my way to make them happy so they would remain a customer.  I will not order from this company again.  Customer Service is very important to me and this company dropped the ball.

0;" ""My family have been gluten free for 10 years now. I also work in the natural products industry at the senior level and have seen the deception first hand. Gluten is quite a serious issue as when it is consumed the villi are inpaired and other nutrients needed to be assimilated for other necessary body functions are not absorbed. It has caused my family other serious complications from eyesight to teeth and mouth difficulties and it has to stop. I am writing this reveiw because I am tired of feeling powerless while companies are prospering at the expense of our health. I follow a paleolithic diet for the most part and recently for my birthday decided to have a turkey sandwich on Udi's bagels. Well they are most certainly not gluten free. EVEN IF LESS THAN 5ppm still makes someone sick. My entire mouth broke out in canker sores and I got a white spot on my front tooth that has not gone away because the gluten sensitivity is preventing iron absorption. Udi's is making millions of dollars and people are getting sick even if they are not sensitive enough to feel it. We had the gluten tested at the doctor's and yep sure enough it was UDI's bread that we reacted to. I hope this review helps at least one other person not get sick. """

0;"""This is my first review ever after being a customer of Amazon for almost a decade.  I do it to save others from this awful product.  I too was so excited to try this new k-cup. With<br />high hopes I placed it in my trusty Keurig and pressed the button.  This was without a doubt the most vile bitter tasting coffee I have ever had including the stuff they sell by the<br />gallons in gas stations.  At first I could not believe it and brewed another cup as well as a cup of two other brands of k-cups"
0;"""This is an extremely inferior product. Six of the coffee pods were broken open with grounds pouring out of the box. The remaining pods were ALL stale even though the use by date on the box was  December 2012. All went in the trash. I'll never buy from  Brooklyn Bean Roastery again.  Also"
0;"""I bought these the other day because they seemed a good deal and also had many different flavors. I used the first one and the Keurig seemed to drip out instead of flow. I tried to use a regular K-Cup that I had and it worked fine. I tried this with over 10 of The Brooklyn K-Cups"
0;I preordered this product and have been very disapointed in it. Almost every time that I brew this in my Keurig brewer there are grounds in my coffee. Sometimes the bottom doesn't punture and the k-cup flows over and at other times it does but there are still grounds. I have had to brew two cups usually to get one cup of coffee. My other brands don't have this problem. I gave it one star because when I do get a decent cup it tastes OK.
0;"""The price seemed reasonable so the wife and I thought we would give this French Roast a try. We were very disappointed. The aroma and taste were more reminiscent of vending machine coffee. If you are expecting something similar to Starbucks"
0;"""These kcups are not sealed correctly and as a result the fail.  Top seal opens up and sometimes the filter inside shifts and grinds jam up the coffeemaker.  Many of the cups are stale as a result of the poor seal.  I purchased 4 different Brooklyn Bean Roastery flavors and they all had the same issue.<br />Company was contacted and quick to send replacement"
0;"""THE COFFEE IS EXCELLENT WHEN YOU CAN FIND A K-CUP THAT DOESN'T EXPLODE IN YOUR COFFEEMAKER. ONE OUT OF EVERY 6<br />WILL ACTUALLY MAKE IT THROUGH A COMPLETE BREWING CYCLE WITHOUT EXPLODING. AMAZON HAS REFUNDED MY MONEY BUT I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS ITEM UNTIL THE MANUFACTURER HAS RESOLVED THIS ISSUE. I LOVE AMAZON"
0;I understand this is a new company and I think they had quality control failure.  Every cup clogs and what does drip out comes with grinds.  We've tried way too many to make a return.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
0;"""I usually do not want to complain about a product but I just started using the Brooklyn Bean Cyclone dark roast K-cups and have a issue with the K-Cup itself. Seems it likes to make a real mess of my coffee maker with grounds all over the place. I have not had a problem with any other K-cup brand coffee"
0;Does not work with your one cup. Some cups empty Terrible product.Cups stop filling have way through causing spillage and quite a mess. Causes machine top half way spilling hot water everywhere and leaving quite a mess.Got a nasty burn from removing
0;"""I received this last week and was surprised that there were coffee grounds all over the amazon box.  I thought it might be one of the kcups inside had broken and that was the case but it appeared that none of the kcups inside were damaged.  That being said the outside packaging looked promising"
0;"""This site requires one to rate an item with a star system. We would have not have given any stars based upon the deceptive description of this product.<br />Should you prefer the taste of Starbucks' French Roast"
0;"""We preordered the 36 count Brooklyn Bean Roastery Fuhgeddaboutit K-cup product before it was released. When the order arrived the shipping and all packaging was perfect with no damage to any part of the order. When we began to brew the individual K-cups in our Keurig brewer there was a problem with grounds in the coffee and the brewer had a tendency to clog up using the Brooklyn Bean Roastery brand K-cup. The individual K-cups all seemed to be a normal size with no apparent damage. We have owned our Keurig brewer for several years and tried a large amount of other brands and coffee types without any problem. I'm not sure if this was a bad box or bad batch of the product"
0;"""This brand of K-cups are horrible. I have a problem with grounds coming out of the top while brewing and clogging my Kuerig coffee maker. It is a pain getting all of the grounds out of the brewing area. I have only used 6 of the k-cups and 4 out of the 6 have been defective. I would not recommend them at all. The coffee itself tasted good with the 2 that I actually had work"
0;"""I have no idea how they taste as the first 3 exploded.  What a mess to clean up.  I phoned Amazon immediately and they were wonderful. They refunded my money and I threw the kcups away. I don't even want to try these things again as I don't need the mess to clean up. If I  wanted the mess"
0;"""Brooklyn  French Roast  K-Cup Coffee is not one of my favorites. It's not awful.  It's okay if you're in a  pinch  and it's the only pod you have.  I ended up giving my entire box to a friend.  I wasn't a fan.  There was nothing special or memorable about the taste.  I won't buy it again and I won't recommend it."""
0;"""[Update: Brooklyn Beans sent me a new box - as you can see in the comments below. 1 out of 24 cups was not sealed. I have now learned to squeeze the k-cup just slightly to see if the foil lid responds to the light pressure. If it bulges just a little"
0;I stopped buying this product after I realized it was made in china. My jack russel threw up a few times and I couldn't figure out why until I read the government warning about made in china chicken jerkey. I would warn anyone to stay away from this.
0;"""These pine nuts are a product of China.  Had I known that I would NOT have purchased them.<br /><br />Why?  These Chinese pine nuts leave a distinctive and extremely unpleasant metallic flavor on the tongue which lasts for as long as two weeks depending on how many are eaten.<br /><br />Being a raw foodie"
0;" ""Pignolia  generally refers to pine nuts from the Stone Pine.  The nuts from this tree are superior in their taste and health benefits to other pine nuts.  The packaging here seems intended to make the buyer think they're getting Italian Stone Pine nuts"
0;I am going to take the advise of the first reviewer and add a bunch of stuff. I guess I was hoping this would taste like Kraft Mac and Cheese and no go. My kids like it and that is what matters most I guess. We just went gluten free and so I maybe over time we will get used to it. We are also eating rice sticks that are sold mostly to chinese restaurants and those are GREAT! Made with just rice and water-you can use them for just about anything.I guess that will be more to my taste. Good luck on this item-not for me-kids would say it is pretty good though.
0;"""The nutritional information about this product on the Amazon website is incorrect.  Rather than having 14 grams of carbs (including 3 grams of fiber) per serving of 7 ounces as the Amazon website indicates (as of 3/21/12)"

0;"""I was so excited when I read the reviews for these candies. I remember those wonderful dark raspberry shaped candies that came in a tin given to me on special occasions when I was a kid. THESE ARE NOT SAME. I was hoping to give these out to my nieces and nephews for a special treat but NO WAY. They are stale"
0;I was so happy to see that Betty Crocker had a gluten free line out and that I could get it on sale at my local Target! I bought the brownies and the devils food cake mixes first and LOVED LOVED LOVED both of them. I eat gluten but my 3 year old does not and I couldn't even tell that they were gluten free. Being as excited as I was about the brownies and chocolate cake I decided to give the yellow cake a try as well. I really wished I liked it but I didn't. The cake looked great but had a funny taste to it and a strange smell. First I thought I did something wrong so I went over my steps but I did what the box said and even used real butter and a good vanilla extract. I really think that this can be great because the texture is amazing. Hoping Betty Crocker changes the recipe because this has potential.
0;"""I was so excited to find a commercially available gluten free cake mix. I figured Betty Crocker would make a great cake. I was so disappointed. It was so dense....did not taste at all like cake! I am buying some flour to try to make a cake from scratch. My kids loved it but they were just happy to have cake after not having any for a long time. Luckily"
0;"""This mix only makes one round cake and the flavor and texture are not as good as you would expect - even for gluten free. I have even added more vanilla and sugar on one attempt. I added a packet of vanilla pudding mix to make up for the poor flavor on another try"
0;"""Bought these as a gift but could not give it.<br />The lavender box wold be appropriate for cosmetics . But COOKIES ?<br />Inside were 2 cookies wrapped in cellophane like supermarket snacks.<br />That was it.<br />16.00 for 2 3 x thin cookies rattling around in a silly box."""
0;I've been buying these for my dog for some time but the last bags I purchased are inconsistent with ones bought previously. The most recent chews are tiny and thin and I bought the ones for large dogs. Looking for a new product.
0;"""We have ordered this coffee for years on Subscribe and Save.  There was a time when it was a good deal but those days are over.

0;"""I had tried the Columbian Dark by the same roaster and it was acceptable (Not Great).  Thought this might be better after reading all the positive reviews.  IT IS NOT!  It's almost undrinkable. Bitter/acrid aftertaste that lingers on the tongue long after drinking"
0;My cats became violently ill after eating the Instinct Rabbit Dry food. They were throwing up and stopped eating. They had to be force fed and nearly died. After several vet visits they recovered. I wrote a letter to Natures Variety and sent them a sample of the tainted food for testing. I was hoping I could save other cats from getting sick. They replied that they would not do anything until more cats became ill.
0;"""We having been feeding our two young cats the chicken formula for a while now and they seem to be able to keep it down with little problem. Natures variety touts rotational feeding as a one of the perks of the brand so we tried out this formula. even after adding a small amount in with the chicken the cats become sick with a few minutes and vomit out what they had eaten. Eating it alone without the chicken formula with it produced worse results. Just to make sure I fed them their usually raw food at night and they were fine"
0;My cat became ill like another poster and was vomiting throughout the day.<br />I am very concerned about this because she also has diarrhea now. This has never happened to me before so I will not be repurchasing.
0;"""My sort-of feral cat that I've been feeding actually spit the stuff out and I know he likes rabbits. The dog doesn't even like it and he's always dipping into the cat food. There was a recall for sorguhm on this lot so maybe that affected the taste? Can't seem to get dog or cat to accept any of these wholesome products without grain and it does get to be an expensive experiment but spitting out was a first.<br />Also"
0;In May of 2010 I ordered a box of Slim Jims original flavor 100 count .28 oz.<br />I opened one up and took a bite expecting a really tasty snack but as hard as I tried I just couldn't chew it.<br />It was like shoe leather. After 2 minutes of chewing I spit it out. I packed up the box and sent it back.<br />Amazon was kind enough to refund my money.<br />Next time order the Jacks Links Original .5 oz X Sticks and you can't go wrong.<br />Chuck.<br />PS: Thanks to Amazon for there customer care.
0;Boy are these bad!<br /><br />Bit into the first one.<br />Pasty stuff inside with a slightly crunchy cover.<br /><br />Spit it out immediately.<br />They taste like some unidentifiable chemical and smell bad.<br /><br />My dog ate a few small bites I cut off then refused any more.<br /><br />I feel bad donating these to the food bank but off they go.
0;"""The box in the picture for the Slim Jims sold here says  Spicy Smoked Snacks.  They are not! The item you receive is a box of the original flavor. The only reason I purchased from this seller is because he advertised the spicy slim jims. I could have purchased the orginal slim jims cheaper from someone else. Buyer beware!"""
0;"""Slim Jims may taste ok but that's because they are so greasy. That's what helps the flavor. I can't figure out why anyone would like these as I can't seem to chew them to a point where I feel comfortable to swallow. It's like eating a really really tough piece of gristle meat.  The amount of fat"
0;"""I have been having one everyday for the past 4 days. Then I read the comment that said  its like lard on a stick . So I cut it open and saw it was stringy and all this fat was oozing out. Never eating them again.  (i dont usually pay attention to whats in my food....)"""
0;Bought some of these awhile back when they were on sale for 10c each at my local Safeway grocery. I personally found them to be disgusting. Tried using them in rat traps but the rats won't even touch them!
0;I have gotten this flavor of slim jim before from amazon and loved it however this order tasted like salty cardboard! Expiration date of march 08 but these must have been stored improperly because they are nasty. I guess with amazon your rolling the dice when you order snacks. Sometimes they are good and sometimes they really really bad. Good luck to all who are brave enough to gamble their $$$
0;Don't buy these for your BoB. I just got mine and they expire in July. I assumed they had enough salt to draw in deer but apparently they've discovered a new process for rendering salt useless in preservation.
0;"""This item was purchased and shipped out by Amazon and not a third party company.  I am very disappointed to get this in June 2011 to find out that the expiration listed on the box is Oct 2011.  That is in 4 months.  Truly disappointed in Amazon for selling a product with a short expiration date.  So if you are going to buy in bulk make sure to eat it up quickly because it may be short dated.  But other than that"
0;"""do not buy.  This is the same prodict sold in concentrate form as  Ornamec .  For the price they are charging you can buy almost a quart of Ornamec.  You then dilute down 1-2 oz per gallon for use.  This product should cost no more than $6 or $7 if you want the premix.  Check Ace hardware."""

0;"""I have long haired dachshunds which like to dig out.  In the beginning the fido 525cs worked but was not powerful as it would not shock through the long haired coat of my dachshunds. They had to hit it with the face or shorter haired (skin exposed) underbelly areas in order to get a good reaction on them. I had the fido 525cs set up for maybe 2 months before it stopped working completely and the dogs were back to getting out again.  No"
0;"""This was purchased instead of the advertised $200 system for keeping my two American Pit Bull Terriers in the back yard.  They walk through a fence whenever they feel like it and this worked great for about three months then nothing.  We discovered it no longer worked when we had to retrieve the dogs from the neighbors yard and repair the fence again.  Unfortunately I have tossed the receipt and the limited warranty is so vague as to what is considered covered damage it is hardly worth the fight for 20 something dollars so I will now do a web search for a more effective model that has an indicator light instead of sacrificing my husband to the gods of electricity"
0;AVOID unless you want apple...( product held 90% apple) with less then 14  bitty bits of cherry or berry. If you desire BERRY try the CRUNCHIES freeze dried truly all berry!( if ZERO stars were available this would be a zero...good idea if it really were CHERRY BERRY...so OK 1 star)
0;There are two packages of 2.25 oz each TOTAL. Not 2 packages of 3 containers of 2.25 oz each (totally 18 oz) as the ad says. I have been cheated.<br /><br />I have no idea of the quality yet: I'm just mad that I was promised 18 oz and I have 4.5 oz.

0;I love my Bosch coffee maker for the office.  Hard to find coffee pods. Bought the Maxwell House Blend and Morning Blend.  Both of these products are terrible tasting coffee.  What happened to the better brands of coffee.  Guess I'll have to buy another Keurig coffee maker for the office.  Much better coffee options
0;I thought maybe it was just me when I wanted to spit it out after first taste. But now I've had three other people try it and they all agree it's not good. I agree with the reviewer who said it tasted like instant.

0;"""What I was expecting was a chai tea similar to one I find in popular coffee houses: a spiced tea infused with cream and sugar. This tea smells wonderful but the taste when you are drinking it is very plain to me. Also it is missing the cream and sugar elements so it has none of the flavor and body of a coffee house chai. I've also tried three other chais from Timothy's"
0;I love Chai Tea.  I don't even put sugar or honey in my Chai Tea.  This was just not right.  Tasted burnt out of the keurig and the cloves are overpowering.  No amount of honey and milk could make this right for me.  I am suffering through my 24-pack and may just throw it out.  Very disappointing.  I've had this brand/flavor in the bags before (although not recently) and liked it just fine.  Even bought it multiple times.  Not sure what is not working right with the k-cup formula.
0;I had such high hopes for this mix but it was really disappointing. The main flavor was salt. Which made me think that maybe there was some sort of mix up between the salt and the sugar when the batch was made?... I hope it was a mistake. Though I will not purchase again.
0;This gum burned the hell out of my mouth. I chew gum 8 hours a day while working because it helps me not think about smoking. First day I chewed 8 pieces of gum and woke up the next day with burns in my mouth. My tongue has been swollen for 3 days now. It hurts to eat and talk. I am not happy to say the least. Too bad amazon wont let me return this crap.

0;"""I first fretted that we would not receive the flowers for Mother's day. We received them today and I wish we had not been so fortunate. The flowers are absolutely disgusting to the point my wife threw them at me when I walked in the door. The roses were brown alround the base pink and the foilage was all brown and quite dead. The baby's breath was also dead on arrival. I have never been so disgusted in my life and I will be paying for this for a long time. Speaking of paying I would have been far better off going to a local florist or even a super market.<br /><br />I have been buying from Amazon for years but this ends it.

0;I love all the Gerber Puff varieties and so does my son. I was eager to try the Sweet Potato to see how he would like them. He loves them!!! All was well until I removed him from his high chair and saw orange spots everywhere. He is learning to self feed and drools quite a bit so I when he was grabbing at them with his wet hands some of the puffs on the tray got wet. When I went to clean off the tray the puffs came off but everywhere there was a wet puff I now have an orange stain. I wouldn't be so mad of there was some kind of warning on the jar but I can't find one. I am really glad he was shirtless or I can't imagine what his clothes would look like.
0;I purchased this nutiva manna because of the special price. It is incredibly difficult to mix. I left it in hot water a long time it did no good and even a microwave was not useful. Worked to mix it a long time. Then worse yet I ate it out of the jar this has very little coconut flavor and is waxy oily terrible. It even messed my stomache up later. Coconut is one of my fav flavors but not this manna. I thought maybe I use the jars for my face or feet so it is not a total waste. Would not even give this one star so gross.
0;There was no expiration date on the two jars I received. I called Nutiva and asked if this product was to have an expiration date on it and they said that there should be two dates on the jar. A packed on date and an expiration date should be present.  I then went a local store who I thought might carry this product and yes there is a packed on date and an expiration date which is one year from the packed on date. Amazon did make good and refund my purchase price.

0;The one time I forgot to check reviews...I am normally really good about reading different reviews and we were wanting to try and find and try some other coffee blends.<br /><br />This is instant coffee in a K-cup.
0;I bought this coffee thinking it was microground coffee (meaning finely ground for a more robust flavor) - I was so wrong !  This is instant coffee!  If you are looking for a full bodied medium roast coffee - this is NOT the coffee for you !
0;This is unlike any other k cups I have tried.  It is extremely weak tasting and only half of the actual cup is filled with ground coffee.  It tastes like instant coffee.  Im gald I got this super cheap.  I will not be buying it again.
0;I received my order with 4 colors lose.  This was due to poor packing.  I contacted the seller and they ask me to remove the claim from Amazon so they can find an arrangement to replace lost colors.<br /><br />Who will compensate for my time and cleaning agony of spelled color???!!!

0;Walmart has this 32-can pack for HALF this price at $12.00 and even the local ranch feed store prices it at $14.00. Most of the cat food prices at Amazon seem to be very high and just may not be the place to buy these items.
0;"""I ordered this for my 17 year old cat. She only has one tooth and is very finicky. She will only eat the seafood pate of Friskies. I thought the purchase was a great deal since it was cheaper than Walmart and I could have it delivered to my house for a free price. I thought this was a good idea.<br />Well"
0;The grocery store for black-eyed peas is around $1.50 per pound. What makes this product (and many similar products available on-line) worth so much more? Local purchases do not involve shipping costs either. Check your local supermarket before you buy this stuff. 24 packages of beans would cost you $36.

0;there are plenty of other places online to get this same spice for less. The way the description is written it makes it sound as if you are getting more the the 3 little bottles you get. Though I love this spice I know I paid about 10.00 to much - about as much as it would be to ship back and start over - lesson learned - do not buy from here again.

0;"""Donut Shop is one of my favorites. Though it is also the blend I get the most failures with. So I decided to pick up a box of this Donut House flavor at my local Bed Bath & Beyond. To me it is awful! No flavor at all and hardly any color. I normally buy bold flavors/variants and pump the 10oz mug size. I had to lower this one to 8oz to not totally wash it out. I was very hopeful but just forcing my way through the batch. I'm hoping"
0;This is supposed to be a light roast coffee but it states extra bold on the label. How can a light roast coffee be extra bold. The outside of the box does not state that it is extra bold it only says light roast. Threw the entire box in the garbage after I tasted the first cup. Did not want to be bothered with returns.
0;"""I mistakenly grabbed this Donut HOUSE blend at Costco thinking it was the Donut SHOP blend of k-cup (by Coffee People).  I realized it wasn't Donut SHOP the first time I made a cup.  It was REALLY light - basically colored water"
0;"""Due to the good price I started doing subscribe and save for my 3 cats. I just got my second shipment and am planning on throwing all of them away because I have realized it is making all 3 of my cats sick. All 3 have dry noses and warm ears. Their poop is black and one of my cats has very bad smelling poop which has never happened. I give them Earthborn on Saturday and Sunday and noticed that they seem to be more active and feel better by the end of the weekend. I thought they were just passing around a cold until I substituted their weekend wet food and they seemed to improve. I googled Friskes cat food makes my cat sick and found a lot of people saying their cats were vomiting"
0;"""I too have noticed the horrible difference in Ovaltine.  Open up the container and you get an instant whiff of the ocean.  It stinks like fish.  Mixing it is like mixing hot cocoa in cold milk.  Clumps floating at the top of the glass"
0;"""Let's call the company and let them know that they need to change it back!!!!<br /><br />800-442-0099 - call them and let them know!!! CHANGE IT BACK!!!<br /><br />This product has gone from good to horrid. Think Coke to Coke II - and we all know how well that panned out. I called the company and have voiced my extreme disappointment. I have been drinking ovaltine since it was in the brown glass canisters and LOVED it then! Now"
0;"""I have been really disappointed with the new Ovaltine formula. I have bought this mostly for my kids because it had an amazing amount of vitamins and minerals and tasted pretty good. I am a label reader. The new product has about one fourth of the nutritional values as before. What used to be 100% or close to it on several vitamins is now only 10%. It's a shame. They have ruined a great product. The taste is still okay"
0;I've been an Olvatine fan for years.  I hate the new stuff and will cease to buy it.  Obviously Nestle thinks substituting their product in an Olvatine container won't be noticed.  Probably an accounting decision.  GRRR!
0;The changed the recipe from Rich Chocolate Flavor to something that smells like gym socks and fish and has no chocolate flavor at all. It tastes like beet juice and leaves a horrible aftertaste. I had used Ovaltine from the time I was a little kid until they played that dirty trick on long time customers. I will not be buying it again.
0;"""Horrible. Absolutely horrible. A friend of mine has drank Ovaltine for years. He was complaining how bad the  new  recipe was. I talked him into letting me try the old recipe Ovaltine and it was delicious. I loved it. It  blew nesquick out of the water. He then proceeded to give me a glass of the new recipe. It was horrible. I immediately tasted the difference and almost spit it out. Disgusting. My girlfriend was given the same test and she too thought it was rancid. There is no excuse to ruin the flavor of a long loved product to a horrible tasting product with much lesser nutritional value. I really hope no one buys this garbage to send them a clear message."""
0;I am so disappointed in the new improved flavors of Ovaltine.  Why would they change a good thing?  I won't drink it anymore.  The LEAST Nestle could have done was offered the traditional flavors ALONGSIDE the new improved flavors so consumers could pick.  I don't like Nestle for doing this.
0;"""I don't understand why they would do this. They have had a tried and true product since 1906 and the corner on the rich malty flavored beverage market. If they wanted to compete with other sickeningly sweet chocolate beverages"
0;In the product description it says you will receive 24/5.5 ounce cans of cat food. When received in the mail I received ONE can of cat food. It also says shipping weight is 10 pounds and turned out to be under one pound. They have false advertising! No wonder this turns out to be so cheap.
0;"""I ordered the cheese ball as shown on the photo instead I received a wedge of cheese.They should detail the photo is a 20 pound ball. They offered me a $10.00 dollar refound for a $42.00 purchase. <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00471XOL0 >Provolone Piccante by Auricchio (8 ounce) by igourmet.com</a>"""
0;"""I bought this because according to the picture it was just the XXX water that I love.  The water arrived in a large box that fell apart as I was dragging into the garage.  As the box broke and the case of water fell onto the floor"
0;"""Who would order a 24 pack of something that can be bought almost anywhere for under a $1 each online for more?  Let alone nearly 3 times the price.  And warning to anyone that hates the taste of all of the artifical sweeteners"
0;The hooves arrived with the peanut butter crumbed not packed in the hoof. The point of buying the hooves with the peanut butter is to give the dogs a challenge. I had to throw the crumbled mess away and give the dogs just he plain old hoof.
0;Buyer beware.  Read  COMPLETELY  when and what you are getting and how much it is.  Very confusing and Amazon does not help when the hassle arrives.  The Flying Noodle can't be trusted either for their 100% satisfaction guarantee.  Don't expect much when the cheese does not arrive.  Even if they send you a notice it has shipped they find a reason to look good to Amazon in their correspondence.  Can't tell you how the cheese tastes because it never came!
0;my dog is hospitalized with severe hypoglycemia and with poor prospects of survival.  One of the biggest causes of this in pets is food with Xylitol in it.  It is lethal if ingested.  If you want to use this please be careful you keep it away from pets. It is in loads of sugarless gums as well.
0;"""My family and I have been morel hunters for years.  We live in Iowa not far from the published address for FRESHMORELS.  I was excited when I stumbled on this product and the web site touted it as having  three times as much morel flavor as the actual mushroom .  I ordered one bottle of every type they offer. I prepared the food as advised on their website. The first bottle was awful.  There was not a hint of morel flavor and the oil tasted just this side of rancid.  I tried every single bottle hoping the previous bottles were anomalies.  They were all bad.  Then I noticed that the  ENJOY BY 12/01/12  was actually a little sticker that had been added over the label.  Underneath was something that had been scribbled over with a black marker.  I removed the marker with alcohol and revealed an expiration date in AUGUST 2009. I checked the other bottles...ditto.  An email to Freshmorels produced a response claiming that the original expiration date was a  printing error ...uh huh."""
0;When i received this product i was very disappointed. The product was spoiled and old. I ordered several packages and after i opened one i contacted the seller and wanted to returned the other unopened and it was not possible.<br />I am not recommend to any one to buy this product.
0;"""I am from Ukraine.I cooked buckwheat there for a 30 years. This one was horrible. As soon as I put it in the boiled water it was broken and had look as prepared oatmeal.I always boiled it 10-15 minutes before"
0;"""Probably not made in the USA since I can't get a straight answer from the company.  I canceled todays order and will throw out the remaining bag I have from my previous order.  Very disappointed because I thought I had finally found a safe treat for my dogs.  Guess I'll keep looking<br /><br />Update.<br />So"
0;"""Ordered a package of this cocoa around April 25th 2011.  It was fabulous.  Worthy of the 4 1/2 stars rating. Deep rich color.  Well sealed.  So good we needed to reorder about a month later.  So went back to same amazon site"
0;"""I was so excited to receive my first dutch-processed cocoa powder especially after all the wonderful reviews of the Frontier one on Amazon.<br /><br />I was first apprehensive about the 'Organic Herbal Essence' - 'Frontier' mixup but when I saw a big red rimmed label with  Frontier  in green on the bag along with USDA Organic & Fair Trade mark/logos among other print"
0;Do not waste your money on this product. It has an awful rancid flavor (this might be due to improper storage procedures and oxidation). Cannot return it either - Amazon return policy. Go for a superior product like the one from KAF.
0;Bought 3 of these.  One came in smelling funny.  Thought it was me.  Ordered a 2nd it was just fine.  Smelled okay.  Ordered a 3rd one and it smells bad.  I would not recommend this product.  Something is seriously wrong here.
0;I did a search for Folgers K Cups and this product showed up.  I thought I was getting K Cups and I ordered both regular and decaf.  MY FAULT for not reading closely and reading reviews before ordering.  AMAZON'S fault for placing these products in with the K Cup. And of course they cannot be returned.  I will donate them to something or someone and be much smarter before ordering again!
0;I thought I had ordered the coffee K-Cups as that is what I had brought up on the screen.  When they arrived and a saw that it was not the correct product I went back to Amazon only to discover that they were not returnable.  I will NEVER order these type of products from Amazon again!~I donated the package to the local food bank.
0;"""No flavor at all.  If you want watered down cofee then this is for you.  Despite making a  larger  cup all they due is push more water through the same amount  of coffee as their other products (almost too little as it is IMO).  I expected the discs to be larger with more coffee but unfortunatly that was not the case.  They just send more water through which ends up watering it down and then they have the nerve to label it as  medium .  I suppose if you want a mild coffee then this is the one for you"
0;This stuff stinks.  I feel bad even donating it to the food bank.  I am not even convinced it truly is coffee.  It does not compare to any thing I have ever had with a brand name on it so it is very hard to describe. If you like coffee this is not for you.
0;"""A prior reviewer stated  you won't be able to eat just one . I think they meant  you'll barely be able to eat them <br /><br />I'm a curry lover and purchased the curry flavor from a local store. It is really hard to describe these"
0;"""I'm always wiling to try a new gluten free snack - and this one looked interesting. I love sea salt and I love pretzels. The taste is just average. The seeds give a very odd aftertaste. The worst part is some of the pieces are ROCK solid and I am seriously afraid that I am going to crack a filling with every bite. What on earth can I dip these in to soften them"
0;These things are gross.  I really mean it.  Both me and my g/f tried them and spit them out.  They taste like stale pretzels with no flavor filled with seeds.  I don't think mustard would help to get these things down.  I am really astonished that anyone would give Sticks and Twigs anything over 2 stars.  I think that these may be company employee reviews.  I am not even a picky eater and had to throw out the entire bag.  Stay away...stay far far away from these atrocious crackers.
0;These pods have the firmness of a teabag and it definitely shows in the cup.  I've made drip coffee thicker than this.  I've used Illy Dark and Starbucks ESE pods and they are 10 X better (especially Illy).  Both Illy and Starbucks are pre-tamped and firm as they should be.  Water rushes through these in about 5 seconds per shot versus 20-25 seconds per shot with the better pods I've used.  I thought I'd be safe ordering these considering they are probably Illy's number one competition but these were a major disappointment.<br />I called Amazon told them of my disappointment and I was taken care of great customer service!
0;I have been ordering Lavazza espresso pods from amazon for several years now. My recent order has pods made with a different paper that make tan water not coffee. I can not find anyone to respond to my complaints. All I ask is that they replace the defective pods. My espresso maker works fine.
0;I've received several orders of the 150 pod packs this year with the subscription service. The taste is usually pretty good. Not as great as the Espressione 100% Arabica (which is my favorite) but this is cheaper and does the morning caffeine trick. The last package received last week is just awful. They are not expired and yet smell and taste like wet dirty shoes or what I would imagine wet dirty shoes taste like - since I have no real experience with that :). Anyway I called Amazon today to complain and see if I could get my money back. I wasn't expecting much since there is a no return policy on grocery items.<br /><br />AMAZON WAS SO HELPFUL! I was only on hold for a few minutes. I spoke with a great woman who is shipping a replacement package to me overnight. I don't even have to mess with shipping back the bad pods. I can just dispose of them. I'm totally happy with the great customer service.<br /><br />I hope the next shipment tastes as expected.
0;"""I recently switched to the Lavazza pods after trying the Starbucks pods for a month. The difference is like night and day: the Lavazza pods are disgusting! Compared to the espresso I can get from a Starbucks pod"
0;"""I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this. These pods do not work correctly in my ESE pod machine (DeLonghi). The Baronet brand pods work perfectly. Didn't realize that not all ESE pods are made to the same standards. The Lavazza pods are not big enough or something because at best you get a dish-water weak coffee. Since I have about 130 of these pods left"
0;I was excited to get this food and see if I could get my 3 cats to lose some weight after reading the reviews.  I put the food out for my cats the day it arrived.  They sniffed it and walked away.  The food sat there all weekend and they have refused to eat it.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad bag?
0;"""I purchased the Butter Rum Coffee from Arbuckle's through Amazon.Com.<br />Arbuckle's called and said that flavor (Butter Rum) was no longer available.<br />We switched to another flavor and I could have gotten it  cheaper  by ordering<br />that flavor direct.  I really wanted Butter Rum and was willing to pay More for<br />that flavor instead of paying a higher price for a secondary flavor.  Unhappy!!!"""
0;I had this on a month to month order.  When I went to add an extra months order they changed the price for everything.  I couldn't cancel order and had to pay 1.20 per box instead of .77.  I was very disappointed.
0;This product caused my dog to have bad indigestion problems. He was sick for two days. I read the packaging and it did not have anything on it to make me suspect it could be harmful. They need to put on there that it can be harmful to dogs digestive tracts. I will definitely be throwing the rest of the package in the trash.
0;Very disappointed in the whole thing... I would have sworn that the price was 1/2 what I'm expected to pay...It looks like something you'd get at the dollar store... Matter of fact... I'm going to try and return it and go to the dollar store and buy something nicer to serve my caviar in.
0;I have ordered these cookies numerous times.  This last order though was horrible.  The cookies were all burnt little crisps.  I wrote to the company about this issue and got no response.  Won't be ordering these again.  Buy at your own risk.
0;"""I purchased the BACK TO NATURE crispy oatmeal cookies locally.  They were delicious.  The cookies were no longer available locally so I purchased cookies through Amazon as directed by the BACK TO NATURE website.  The cookies are disgusting.  They are not the same cookies that I purchased locally.  BACK TO NATURE must get rid of their rejected cookies through Amazon.  Since I cannot return the cookies"
0;"""MY DD has trouble with solid foods but loves the puffs. I ordered this to get some variety from the standard gerber puffs/ sticks.  Unfortunately I ordered a pack of six thinking that these would have a similar texture to the other snacks.  These snacks are hard for ME to chew and actually cut the roof of my husbands mouth when he tried them. At first we thought it was just a bad canister"
0;Hardly any licorice flavor. Its tecture is gummy and soft.<br /><br />I've had some stomach problems after eating it.<br /><br />I would not recomend this product.<br /><br />When I recived the shipment the bags it was shjipped in were torn open and the candy was loose in the box.<br /><br />Gustaf's sugar free drops were a dissapointment.
0;Someone left a can of these in our work kitchen. I tried a few and I could not believe how salty they were. Looking at the Nutriton Information I found out why. 2300 mg of Sodium in a 2 Tablespoon serving size! I can't believe these are even allowed to be on the market without a warning. There is no reason to have this much sodium.
0;Most of the Merrick 5 star varieties seem to go over with my dog. But the Venison Holiday Stew gives him the worst gas... and he never gets gas. Don't buy this unless you hate your dog and have no sense of smell!
0;Received as a gift and looks very nice until you open the packaging and realize portion sizes are very small with products that are not brand names you recognize (look & taste generic.)  Very low quality items that make it appear you have given a cheap basket when in reality you are paying quite a bit ($40) for something that recipient will think you spent less than $20.  Not worth the money.
0;"""No problem with the vendor or the shipping. My cat used to love this product & looked forward to getting it each night when I got home from work. I would  say  beaver  & he would come running & wait by his dish. This last batch is dry & my cat won't eat it. I even bought a can from a local pet food store & found the same problem. When I talked to the pet food store owner she said there have been a lot of complaints. I won't buy this product again & wonder what has changed  with the manufacturer. The local pet food store owner said this company is very difficult to deal with & it probably wasn't worth my time complaining because they are unresponsive. Maybe they'll care about quality when people stop buying their product."""
0;Recently purchased a bag of Dogswell Chicken jerky Treats from PetCareRX. When received at home a friend informed us to make sure that the product was not made in China as the FDA had issued a warning in November 2011 of a foodborne illness that was traced back to jerky treats made in China. Apparently this is the second such warning has been issued. Dogs were getting sick and even dying. No where on PetCareRX's site did they present the warning nor indicate the product was made in China. The package is unopened. Asked for RA to return product for refund. REFUSED!  PetCareRX says to pay for return shipping ourselves and they will not refund the outgoing shipping. They continue to sell the Chinese made jerky treats to their customers regardless of the FDA warning still in effect. After putting our pet at risk to ask us to incur further costs just to get back to even is ridiculous. SHAMEFUL.
0;"""Don't order these unless you need a laxative!  These cookies contain the sweetener  maltitol  which has a laxative effect.  THAT'S WITH ONE COOKIE!  This should have been stated with the nutrition facts on the box. The canister type container of Jennie's Brand macaroons is wonderful!<br />This BIG box contained 10 quarter-sized cookies"
0;I bought this Xylichew Peppermint gum today at my local natural food store--never checked the price of $13.98--wish I did because I hate it. Flavor lasts about 10 seconds--kid you not. If you really want to try it see if it comes in a smaller size before committing to this container of 100. (What was I thinking when I bought it?)
0;Chinese made products are beyond questionable when it comes to dog edibles. I was disappointed to read these too are China made. My dog's health and life is worth a more. I will stick to non toxic and good quality controlled foods for my dogs.
0;"""My 5 month old french bulldog puppy almost died on the first bone tonight.  He chewed it down and attempted to swallow a piece that was too big to go down his throat.  When he began gagging and throwing up I had to stick my hand down his throat to push the lodged bone into his stomach.  VERY scary and upset me greatly.  I do NOT recommend these bones.  There is even a choking warning on the back in small writing.  Keep your pet safe and purchase MUCH BIGGER bones for them"
0;DANGEROUS BONES!!! Little dogs love these bones because they are tasty BUT they are truly dangerous. Our family Maltese (Pebbles) who had just turned one choked to death on one. They are not even safe if your supervising your dog because our dog choked on one in the presence of my sister. We were unable to do anything for her as we watched in horror as she slowly stopped breathing and got her to the vet in less than ten minutes. The vet attempted an emergency procedure and removed two peices and the bone had also tore her trachea. Her death was caused by these bones. These bones are not worth your precious pets life as it tore our family apart.
0;I just lost my dog of 14 years to a Dingo bone. She choked to death last night. I rushed her to a emergency vet clinic but it was too late. She was a Shih Tzu so beware if you have a small dog and you give them these. She ate Dingo bones as a treat all of her life and never had a problem. I have another dog and just threw out 4 bags of these. NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY THESE for my dog.
0;"""I was skeptical to give my yorkie rawhides but my vet said it would be okay.  These were the only treats that would keep him entertained since he doesn't care much for toys and they were very easy to find.  Unfortunately my dog seemed to swallow a large piece of the mini dingo rawhides yesterday.  At 2 am I heard my dog let out a loud howl that I have never heard before"
0;"""I gave Grape Big League Chew to my dog.  He couldn't stand it and spit it out and decided his time was better spent licking himself.  He does however love the original BLC flavor and chews it often.  He even has bubble blowing contests with the rest of the neighborhood dogs.  Overall"
0;Almost every order was delivered with some of the cans dented.  This last order actually had a can damaged so badly that it was open.  We did not initially observe the broken can.  After about a week in our pantry the smell was unbearable.  We inspected  numerous items from the pantry before determining that the smell was coming from the Mighty Dog.  Worms were observed in one open can.  We got rid of the offending can and about 4 others that had fluid from the broken can.  We immediately cancelled any future orders.
0;Unfortunately this is a very poor representation of Jack Link's Beef Jerky. The bags are small and the jerky is in very small pieces and crumbs. It looks like scraps or left overs. No piece is larger than 1/2 inch.
0;"""So I have been hanging with a top player at the world series of poker and I purchased 2 packages of Jacks Links beef jerky.  These 2 purchases were the worst possible way to spend my money.  The meat was so dry I was not sure if I was eating dried rat tail or beef jerkey.  The  meat  caused sickness and lock jaw.  Jacks links is as good as scraps off leather shoes.  It was pretty incredible of them to sponser the WSOP but provide poor quality food at a ridiculous price."""
0;"""What a rip off.  We opened the bag and a day later there was wispy white mold on it.  The whole bag had to be thrown out.  It even smelled a little  off .  You're better off buying it at the store."""
0;"""I got Teryaki flavored of the mega packs and yuck! The jerky was so hard and crunchy and old.... It said that it expires in 2013 but still it tastes so nasty so i threw it away and got a refund for my purchace. Amazon is great but these people sell nasty jerky"
0;"""I got the peppered flavor and it tastes awful.  It's spicy as heck but the pepper taste is so overwhelming that it totally ruins it.  I got through about half a bag and not more then 2 pieces at a time.  Totally disgusting.  I like beef jerky and Jack Link's especially"
0;"""I bought this because it said it was  Gluten Free  No MSG  on the label in the picture.  When I received it and read the ingredients I found it contains Monoammonium Glutamate.  This ingredient contains the same processed free glutamic acid as MSG (Monosoduim Glutamate).  It is the processed free glutamic acid that causes all of the bad side effects of MSG!<br /><br />So"
0;This popcorn tastes and smells horrible. It smelled like some kind of chemical was used with the popcorn and you can even taste it. I threw the rest of the popcorn away. Dont buy it. Seriously. The best organic popcorn I have had so far is Full Circle popcorn.
0;"""DISGUSTING!!!! I really don't know how there are reviews about this product being good. I bought this product because I didn't have any homemade amchar left and would have to wait for someone to go the distance to acquire some more. I read the ingredients"
0;"""The name of this product sounds better than it tastes. Save your money and treat yourself to a bottle of English Toffee syrup for your coffee. This product leaves an awful after taste. I had to give at least one star"
0;I normally love Stash Tea but this flavor is bad. It has a very weird chemical type taste. At first I thought it might just be me so I made my wife a cup and she yelled out to me from the other room that this is the worst tea that I have made for her. Too bad I bought the 100 count! I guess I will have to look for another flavor.
0;"""When I ordered the Theater-Size Jujubes I made especially sure that the Jujubes were the 6.5 oz Theater-Size boxes (double-checked description etc. in the vendor's ad).  When I received the Jujubes they were 1.5 oz boxes instead if the 6.5 oz.  So I paid the same price for the 1.5 oz boxes as I would have paid for the 6.5 oz sized boxes.  The product was totally misrepresented by the vendor.  I would not have ordered this product had I known the  real  quantity size.<br /><br />I decided not to return the candy because it was just too much trouble to do so.  The main thing I wanted to do is let you know how the vendor misrepresented their product.<br /><br />I have ordered so much from Amazon and this is the very first time anything like this has ever happened and I was really disappointed."""
0;"""I'm a big fan of green tea.  I really cannot think of a green tea I've tried that I haven't liked - except this one.  Yuck.  It is very bitter and strong.  I could only make it drinkable by adding some milk and a packet of matcha tea.  I am super disappointed in this product"
0;Sour. So very sour. This tastes like what you find in a wannabe coffee shop (maybe more like a kiosk) that has no respect for the bean. Not sure why Lavazza would distribute this low quality roast under their famous name.
0;I have bought Lavazza in the past and it was OK.  This time it was really bad.  Worse than Folgers.  An aggressive dry stale taste for espresso.  I tried to use it up on filter but it was still very bad.  Equal to the worst coffee you would get in a greasy spoon.  Amazon has a note on their site that there is a problem so maybe the problem is only temporary.  Amazon sent me a refund and suggested I write a review to warn others.
0;I wish I would have read the return policy before I bought the beans. NO RETURNS & the coffee was terrible. The beans looked old and dried out. Coffee was weak & not very rich in flavor. I read other reviews and it sounded great. I use a french press and used the same amount of coffee as I do with any other espresso that I buy and it is no where near the same. Tried adding more coffee and still was not good. now i have a couple pounds of beans.....guess I will donate them to the free store or to someone that is use to automatic drip
0;Had great expectations after reading Amazon reviews.......Coffee was weak with very little taste.  The beans are light colored and the taste is not that of espresso.  To bad Amazon has no return policy for grocery products.
0;I have a professional expresso machine and have had it for nearly 10 years. I decided to try these beans because the hype was convincing.  The express / lattes that were made using these beans was really awful. It tasted like gas station out of a vending machine coffee.  It was so bad that I had to brew all the beans to remove from my machine and it did this so that i could put in Starbucks beans. So much for experimenting.
0;"""I bought this based on the reviews only . i didnt bother to read the 1 or 2 star ratings. If you look at the 1 star ratings this is exactly the same thing i experienced. I dont know what planet the 5 star ratings come from or i got a bad batch "
0;"""I would say I am a professional coffee drinker.  I have been grinding my own beans for over 30 years.  I like strong dark coffee.  At Starbucks I usually order 1/2 cup of regular coffee spiked with a double shot of espresso.  That being said this product was a huge disappointment.  I don't doubt the quality of the beans they used.  The beans looked like they were of excellent quality.  My complaint is with the roast.  This was supposed to be an Dark Espresso roast and clearly it was not.  I think this company needs to re-evaluate there roasting quality control.  There finished product was light in color and coffee brewed from confirmed this.  I tried several different methods of making coffee.  I doubled the mount of coffee used per cup"
0;"""Tracking app. Indicates item has been received at warehouse near my house. It has been sitting there for nearly two weeks! How do I get it? I can't return it. I don't have it!<br /><br />Days later:<br />When I reviewed the tracking application today"
0;I have been drinking this flavored coffee for over a year. Up until now I have loved it. But the last package I got ( in the new packaging and labeling scheme) is absolutely terrible. The aroma is wrong and the taste is now sickeningly sweet. What used to be a slight hint of vanilla now hits you in the face like a wet glove. The coffee's flavor is absoulutely awful. I am sending it back for a refund immediately. So far the other Gevalia coffees I have are still really good but this one is a disaster after the formula for was apparently changed.
0;"""I have been drinking Gevalia Swiss Hazelnut for Tassimo for YEARS (at least 5) and have been on a subscription plan for delivery.  Just opened one of the newly packaged products.  Not only has the packaging changed"
0;"""About 1 out of every 3 disks is bad & to my knowledge there is no reasonable recourse? Tassimo will not pay to have the product shipped back if the  original  post office package has been opened? How do you know a product is inferior if you don't open it?

0;It's very runny and leaves a bitter after taste. I like my snowcones sweet. I guess I'll be dumping this out and going back to the the last syrup I purchased. I thought the large gallon jug would be nice.
0;I put 2 drops into 3 scrambled eggs and mixed it up well. I took one bite and spit it out within 5 seconds and this junk burned the heck out of me.<br /><br />I'm not Mr. Hot Food but I do like spicy food. This stuff may not be poison but it isn't food in my opinion. What kind of people make a dopey product like this? There is a mild warning and a caution to use a drop at a time but that warning is inadequate.<br /><br />It was about 10 minutes of legitimate suffering that was completely unnecessary.<br /><br />Don't buy this junk!
0;I was very disappointed in the taste of the coffee. It did not taste like pumpkin coffee at all. It smelled more like French Vanilla and the spices were all off. I threw out 75% of the bag. What a waste of 5 lbs. of coffee!
0;"""I enjoy my Sodastream machine and have purchased many of the diet flavors. The only one I don't like is the Diet Cream- it is undrinkable. My wife and I both both agreed on what to do with it - down the drain.  We both enjoy cream soda"
0;These coffee pods will damage your Senseo coffee machine! The Melitta packing states that these will fit all single serve brewing machines. This is not true! They are thicker than the Senseo pods and when using them the Senseo lid pops open and hot water spills out. After contacting Melitta they send me an email saying I would have to buy soft pods. These are soft pods!?!? I'm very dissapointed! The coffee tastes great if you are lucky enough to fill a cup without spilling all water.
0;I'm very disappointed with this product. It doesn't fit well on the Phillips Senseo coffee pod machine. I typically do 2 pods for 2-cup brew so I had to do it twice with this one. Produced tasteless watery coffee. Tried this product just for a change from the Senseo coffee pods. I suppose I should just stick with them. I'm just very pleased that Amazon gave me a refund for it.
0;I have purchased this product from local stores and have purchase the fries from amazon.  These chips that were delivered are rancid.  I can't even stand the smell myself.  It now is in my trash can!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM AMAZON.
0;"""I have been buying Sweet Potato and Yam treats for my 3 dogs for the past year or two. My dogs love them so we make sure we always have a good supply on hand. I purchased these particular treats from this particular supplier because the price was a bit less than usual. However"
0;"""This product deserves no stars.<br /><br />I read ingredients SO carefully. In my local pet store I decided to get my boys something different and bought them this treat. Checked the ingredients and they seemed fine. Brand is  Beefeaters USA . After a few weeks my dog was vomiting"
0;"""Seattle's Best has obviously been taken over by idiots. That's the only explanation for this new change in product look and taste. Are they trying to market coffee to grade school children? The new product presentation in bright colored"
0;"""Here's a clue:<br />Seattle's  Best  .....is ALL cheap Robusta beans!!!<br />Tastes like it too... harsh and burnt-like... even in the light roasts...<br />Cuz thats what Robusta tastes like..<br />Heh.."""
0;"""The taffy arrived in a box and not in a sealed plastic bag as one would expect.  The taffy is stale and hard as a rock.  This is the worst salt water taffy I have ever attempted to eat.  Do NOT buy this item"
0;I was so excited to finally find this candy this year because it is my guilty pleasure from childhood and I could not find it locally this year.  I bit the bullet and ordered two bags for $11.50 with my Prime shipping.  When the box arrived the package was WAY smaller and so were the eggs.  For the price and quanity you would think this was a premium candy.  I am very disappointed with Brach's this Easter season and not sure I will ever buy these again.
0;I agree...with the other two reviews.  What a joke.  Now the price is $14.49.  That is insulting.  I love this candy and look for it every year.  This is an insult though.  I would never pay this much...on principal alone.<br /><br />Note that I wanted to give 0 stars...but it wouldn't let me.
0;"""The worst thing is that they do not list the fact this is a 70% Robusto / 30% Arabica blend.<br />I do not like Robusto coffee at all. It has the taste of smelly socks. This is personal preference.<br />Since this coffee did NOT list that it is a Robusto blend and had such great reviews from many people (who obviously like Robusto coffee) I purchased it. I am dissatisfied with it and the item is not what I expected.<br />Since I was not able to return it"
0;Bought the white and green tea from this brand and the tea tastes terrible. It has a terrible taste to it and leaves a terrible aftertaste. Im not sure what makes it terrible since it is supposed to only have 3 or 4 products but BEWARE THIS PRODUCT.<br /><br />Again... tastes terrible... and you know.. Chinese Organics.... also questionable<br /><br />(not racism... just what it is)
0;Was wondering why the gum tasted so different and why the texture was slimy - read the ingredients and the artificial sweetener is what's done it - I personally can't stand artificial sweeteners.  They've totally ruined what was once a very good chewing gum.
0;"""This gum have is an outrage!  It worst than Coke Cola.<br /><br />   When launched Coca-Cola's two key ingredients were cocaine (benzoylmethyl ecgonine) and caffeine. The cocaine was derived from the coca leaf and the caffeine from kola nut"
0;"""Bragg markets this product as  no salt added  and  Healthier than soy  while she herself advocates raw and natural food. This product is made by chemically processing  liquid soy protein  in a way that chemically creates table salt and strips glutamic acids from the soy proteins"
0;"""I tried this stuff at a suggestion of a friend that does not know how to read labels. She told me how wonderful this stuff is and that it has a whole lot less sodium than soy sauce. My husband has high blood pressure so I am always looking for ways to reduce sodium in his diet. We were in the store together and in a rush so I put a bottle in my cart without reading the bottle.<br /><br />As I said"
0;These are made in china...not a good idea at all considering all the food saftey issues of late. also i feel that it is wrong to buy food/agricultural products from another country (a politically hostile one at that) when our own poor farmers are having such a rough time making ends meet because all their work has been outsourced to these unsafe chinese farms. there are many much safer and ethically sound alternatives to these snacks.
0;"""I understand that many of our daily products are now made in China.<br />And I am not saying that all products made in China are bad.<br />I own many products around the house that are made in China.<br />But food is something I refuse to buy that are made in China.<br />In the product description"
0;"""I've kept a bottle of Tabasco in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit.  I've used it in Bloody Marys and added a few drops to many dishes I wanted to  kick up  a notch.<br /><br />I'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently. Huge mistake!<br /><br />After a bit of taste testing I have to say Tabasco is one of the worse hot sauces available. Cayenne Pepper and a lot vinegar are Tabasco's major flavor notes. You can do much better! You won't miss all that bitter vinegar!<br /><br />I could provide a long list of hot sauces that are much better. Here are just a few and I choose them because they are all widely distributed (sold here on Amazon and in your supermarket): Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce"
0;We started using the Blue dog food product for our 3 dachshunds. The last one was the salmon blend. All three dogs developed varying levels of diarrhea. One was very severe.  We started all 3 back on Science Diet and within a couple of days they were all back to normal.  I threw out the Blue and will never risk using it again.
0;"""Very unhappy because I had ordered these Elmo pops for my twin grandchildren's 2nd birthday. They were suppose to arrive between Sept. 17-20. Their birthday party was Sept. 22 and the 2 packages of Elmo pops arrived the following Wednesday AFTER the party"
0;"""Someone recently bought a Keurig to share at work and also bought a box of about 8 different coffees for it.  Most of them were pretty good.  There were decent tasting representatives spanning a nice range of roast.  Of the selection"
0;"""I purchased this product for my husband who loves very bold coffee.  Each time we have made the coffee in our Keurig it explodes all over.  (Clearly after the third try I have now thrown the rest away) We were lucky to always be away from the coffee maker"
0;"""I have tried around 30 different coffees in the k-cup and i keep track on paper as to find some that I really do like.  I like dark coffee.  Tried this one thinking  its Emeril's .  Honestly I don't think he even tasted this coffee much less called it Bold.  Its not bold"
0;"""This coffee was bitter to me and my wife. We believe the coffee was overroasted. It tastes burnt. Also about half of the cups failed to keep the grounds in the Kcup. Either the filter was not installed properly"
0;Have ordered and TRIED to use the Kcups by Emeril -- It is like throwing away your money!  They make a mess of your<br />Keurig and put coffee grounds in your cup of coffee.  As far the taste -- who knows with the coffee grounds in the cup.<br />Try a different type of Kcup and save yourself the money.
0;Others may love this k cup but I found it way too bitter.  I have to admit I don't drink that much bold coffee but have had a chance to try a few others and don't care for this one.  My Keurig only has the 8oz capacity and I took a cue from other users and run the bold k cups through twice to make 12 to 16 ounces depending on the type coffee.  Well even if I run this through twice at a total of 16 oz it is still too bitter... just not my k cup of coffee I guess but I do like Donut Shop and Newman's Own Extra Bold.
0;Too many defective cups. About 1 in 4 k-cups spews coffee everywhere due to the seal on the lid not holding. Amazon gets 100 stars for their quick refunds but quality control for my last 2 boxes of these was just unacceptable.
0;I have had this product on auto ship for several months without problem.  Last order I recieved did not work properly.  Cup over flowed coffee for what ever reason would not allow coffee to flow though.  I tried everything to fix problem.  Brought new cups and work fine so was cups.  Have one more order on way if work no problem but if over flow again will cancel.
0;I purchased this item by looking at the picture and reviews.I had been searching for an all banana container. The picture shows banana laffy taffy and the reviews mention how much the buyer loves banana laffy taffy. I was quite surprised to get a container of assorted laffy taffy. I hate all flavors of laffy taffy except banana. I won't buy from this seller again because of the questionable representation in their advertisement.
0;don`t buy if this has to be shipped. if i could give it zero stars i would. came in to me like a lump of cheap chocolate that was totally unedible. this is supposed to be sold for consumption. worst experience i ever had with an amazon product.
0;"""I have been pleased with shipments of biscotti in the past but this time....not so good.<br /><br />Every one of the biscotti is broken into pieces. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />I will try again"
0;This product advertises that it breaks apart easily for training. Maybe if you have a chain saw handy! The product is as hard as a rock and nearly impossible to break into small pieces to reward poochy.
0;"""It is not the Wonderful Twinings Earl Grey you have come to know and love.  They have pulled a  new coke  blunder and now the best Earl Grey tea ever is available no more!  This tea is weak and tasteless.<br /><br />I hate stupidity"
0;My tea came after three weeks and it was only one pack instead of six. I called and complained and the following week got another one pack instead of six.  That is all I ever received and my money was refunded.  Don't really know what happened...never got an explanation from the distributor.
0;"""I just notice that Amazon had a  video review  options because I would have liked to shown you the amount of bugs inside my bottle/grinder. There were small bugs inside just crawling around...GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!"""

0;"""My Siberian husky did not agree with this food at all. Aside from horrible gas her poop became very soft and liquidy and she began to go at irregular times and would occasionally throw up. She was put on the food gradually and allowed almost two weeks to adjust before I pulled the plug and put her back on her old food. Even when we mixed in White rice her stomach never got used to the food and she remained sick. May be good food"
0;"""We bought this bag for our Welsh Terrier pup the beginning of September and this past week spent over $168.00 in Vet fees for diarrhea and vomit episodes from our little guy. He was tested for everything and nothing came up. The vet concluded it had to be bad food. After we stopped"
0;"""Price is for an unknown weight of these nuts?  Maybe the people who think the public is soft-headed.<br /><br />Look at the spec above and you will see  one pound  shipping weight.

0;the other reviewer is 100% on the nose. From the second I opened the box. The smell was awful. It didn't even get to the bowl. I grabbed some and ate it....bad idea. Quickly opened a box of cocoa pebbles.
0;My dog has been eating a raw diet with Dr. Harveys pre mix.  I bought this to try since reviews were good and it was a little less expensive.  My dog will not touch it.  Wouldn't eat his favorite chicken if it had one drop of this food on it.  Waste of money for me.  I should have bought a small box to try it out.
0;"""I bought this coffee based on the superb reviews it received at amazon. I wanted instant decaf coffee. This one tastes very bad. This is because the roast intensity of the coffee is between light and medium"
0;Cookies arrived with all the chips melted out of the cookies.  The only way we could eat them was to crush them into crumbs and sprinkle on ice cream or pudding and even then they were very hard and not tasty.
0;"""The first problem with this product is the fact that their manual is so vague and also incorrect. The manual indicates to fill the water to the 160mL line - it says 180mL on the carafe. The instructions are incomplete - I had to call them to get clarity on exactly how much water I should be putting in for just an ounce or two of food. The gentleman on the phone that helped me was very nice"
0;The baby breeza worked great for a couple of months.  The machine started leaking grease from the driveshaft into the food.  It made my stomach turn to think I had been giving my son food with grease!  I bought this machine b/c I didn't want to give my son baby food from a jar and so that I know what he's eating.  I was very disappointed.  I also searched to see if other people have had the same problem and I was not the only one.  I ended up buying a Ninja blender and a stovetop steamer.
0;"""We love this unit when it is working and has become a staple in preparing food for a son. The down side is every 2 to 3 months the Drive Shaft locks up. We have been going back to the store and exchanging it for another one. At first we thought it was user error and we might have gotten the Drive Shaft wet causing it to lock up. But we never put it in water"
0;"""I purchased this product from Babys R us and was using it for a few months until all of a sudden the steam start button or the blend button wouldn't always consistently worked.  Tried to return to Babys R us with my repceipt.  They wouldn't take it back and said to contact Baby Brezza.  I left an email with customer service in early November and actually got a call back in a day.  She said she would ship out a replacement and I had to ship back the lid.  I still haven't received the replacement as of today (1-10-12).  I left another email last week and haven't heard from anyone.  I will try calling the 888 number tomorrow.  But it doesn't look promising.  If only they'd give me a refund"
0;We purchased the baby breeza TWICE! Had to return it for different reasons..I even tried calling the 1-800 # for them to talk to me over to phone to see if I was doing something wrong but I had to leave a message. They still have not called back. So as for making baby food easier to make. Honestly I just make them over the stove if I need to steam or cook my baby's food then give them a spin in my blender...
0;This would have been a great product but I has no instruction<br />Booklet included with it and the meta button sticker plate was lifting off.<br />So I never got a chance to see it work. It is a mystery.<br />
0;"""The product worked for a week or so. The cover on the plastic started to come off right at the first time we used it. The knife of the blender causes some black powder residue. Then the blender stopped working at all...We spent $100 for such a bad quality product....Should trust the reviews of other customers. I just liked the idea of 2 in 1 food making...Well"
0;"""I purchased one of these and found the steamer worked but not the blender. I sent it back and the same thing happened. I read other reviews and found that others had the same problem. Apparently a belt slips off during shipment. Once my husband fixed it"
0;"""I absolutely loved this product at first.  I had one of the first models and it worked wonderfully until one day it simply wouldn't turn on.  I called the company and they sent me a new model.  The steam chamber of the new model smells horrible"
0;"""i just got the Brezza today and tried to prepare some food. It steamed food nicely but did not blend properly. after reading instruction i realized that blades do not fall down for blend cycle as it suppose (based on the instruction). the maker definitely goes back.<br />Since all reviews are so great"
0;"""I am so disappointed in this product. It broke the fourth time I used it and the warranty still requires me to pay $10 to have it fixed or replaced (which especially stinks given that this was a gift). It purees food okay"
0;"""When I first bought this item I loved it. But after having it for a few months the biggest problem I have is starting the darn thing! I'll select my steam time I need and when I press start it beeps at me. In problem shooting it says if it beeps 6x then its not locked in but it beeps more then 6x. Plus it doesn't even puree most stuff like green beans"
0;"""I was super excited to get this since I was putting my veggies in a steamer basket in a pan on the stove top. Steaming the veggies and then putting them into the blender to make them into baby food. I though GREAT!! I can save time"
0;"""I loved this product for about 4.5 months!  I used it to make batches of organic baby food several times each month and loved how easy it was to make healthy food for my daughter.  Occasionally I would notice dark particles in the lighter colored foods that I would make and just thought I was seeing bits of the skin from potatoes or carrots that I didn't peel with the greatest of care.  Two weeks ago"
0;"""I guess it's true that ignorance is bliss. I loved using my new Brezza these past couple of weeks.  So easy to operate with very little clean up.  Recently I came across some reviews about the coating in the water reservoir flaking off.  As a result I LOOKED for it during my last meal prep and sure enough"
0;"""We ordered the Baby Brezza and I was excited to try it out.  We took it out of the box and it wouldn't even turn on.  I was very frustrated and we called the company which was gracious enough to send us out a replacement.  The new one worked very well and I have been using it for about 4 months.  I love the machine it steams very well and I can put a fair amount of food in the container.  I do wish the container was larger because I make large batches of food and then freeze them.  I really like this machine"
0;"""Bought this item to make baby food for my twins.  Within a month we started to notice a black liquid coming from the bottom.  We also found that it was not so easy to take out the blade out from the cup.  After 2 months of using the product the motor went out and it did not blend.  We ended up buying a kitchen aide chopper/puree machine for MUCH less and it workes sooo much better and has a bigger blender cup too! After using the Kitchen Aide product you can tell how cheaply made the baby breeza is.  Don't waste your money"
0;"""I ordered this product in December 2011. I must have used it maybe 5-6 times with the steam-blend option. Following is what I observed<br />1. Doesnt blend peas very well.<br />2.

0;I ordered kelp noodles in hopes of using them in place of noodles or rice. They have no taste which is good but they are semi hard and crunchy. I even cooked them and they staying the same. Very disapointed they are horrible and a waste of money.
0;Be aware that Nestle USA recently switched supply of NIDO from their Chile plant to Mexico and the quality is like night and day. Most if not all the previous 5-star ratings were based on NIDO from Chile were the quality of the milk is far superior than the Mexican milk which is horrible!
0;"""We bought this specifically to add body to homemade yogurt. We'd seen only good comments about it. Using less than half a cup of Nido to  42 oz of fresh whole milk resulted in the worst tasting yogurt we'd ever made. We couldn't believe it was the Nido"
0;"""So I was so incredibly excited for this powdered milk to arrive.  I looked at the reviews for this product and they were generally positive.  I saw one dissenting review from a person who said they switched the manufacturing plant from Chile to Mexico and it was horrible now.  I thought he was wrong and was just some bitter man with time on his hands.<br /><br />Boy I was wrong.<br /><br />I never tried this product when it was made in Chile"
0;NASTY NASTY stuff taste like TIN there is woody chunks mixed in when heated it looks like strained baby food. will NEVER NEVER buy ASPARAGUS in a can again. shipping was fast and will buy libbys products again but not this nasty stuff. if I could I would have gave it -5 STARS sorry LIBBYS your products are always good but not this. that was a waste of $11.09 only problem is you can't return it. this stuff should be called (ASPARAGROSS)

0;I have nothing against this products taste. My problem is with the fact that this company doesn't support the military.  It won't allow us to purchase this product and ship it over seas.  Even though we are half way around the world away from our familiy and friends fighting for your freedom I guess we're not allowed to drink coffee while we do it.  Thanks-You're military.
0;"""This mustard is horrible. There is an inverse correlation between the absurdly inflated price of this shameful mustard and its quality. It has a nauseating garlic taste and absolutely no mustard flavor (the quintessential turmeric taste"

0;"""This cheese is not good.  I do not know how to more clearly state it.  It is a strange brown color and comes in an unnatural square shape.  It seems  manufactured  and tastes like no cheese should taste.  Slicing it thin is no help.  It has a strange butterscotch-y flavor"

0;Um my mother described these as chips that went terribly wrong. Never again the taste was horrible!  The bag smells like feet. I literally could nor give these away. I think these people need to give up hope in the kale chip business. The birds in the back yard wouldn't even eat these!

Amazon no longer carries it directly and the reseller is charging $44 for the same package plus shipping(down this week from $49 last week).  The cocoa is not twice as good at these prices and I wish Amazon would find a reseller whose price is somewhat closer to the old amazon price. This is a very disappointing message from Amazon to its loyal customers.  W. Grace

0;I should have read the reviews on these!  About half of the chews in the bag were the thickness of a pencil.  It took my dog no more than 2 minutes to chew through one of these.  These sticks are probably cheaper at Petco.  The only reason I ordered them was to bring my Amazon order over $25 so I could get free shipping.  What a waste of money!
0;I can't believe this item was even approved by FDA. Maybe it was just this one packet - but it tasted like I was eating chemicals or something. I couldn't even have a second bite!...I would have definitely vomitted had I had a second bite. I hope not all their items are as bad. I am definitely not buying from Compleats anymore!

The chai tea disk contains Splenda (sucralose) which to those of us who can't stand the stuff"
0;"""Love the Chai tea taste. Love the ease of use of my Tassimo unit. But read the fine print closely. For every chai tea disc you get you are also receiving (and paying for) a disc of milk/creamer/watered down blegggh. A package of 16 actually means: 8 teas and 8 creamers. It would be worth the money for 16 tea discs alone-- and let you add your own creamer. But Tassimos' creamers are watered-down throw-aways. I have a cabinet full of unused Tassimo creamers (that come with their teas/lattes/cappucinos). It's almost enough to make me stow away my Tassimo coffeemaker. Instead"
0;"""I wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my money buying this product.  I agree with other reviewers that this has a VERY artificial sweetner taste to it. I love chai lattes from coffee places and was hoping that this could replace those"

The rose hip/hibiscus mix does not jive well. Hibiscus tea can be bitter already (which I nornally don't mind) but the rose hips do nothing for the taste but make it more bitter and less enjoyable. I was not satisfied with this purchase. Better off buying loose leaf hibiscus tea and brewing it alone. :( I do want to mention I had no issues with the seller"
0;Don't buy unless you like stale licorice. I love the pastel licorice and I buy whenever I can find it (cause they are rare. I was really disappointed that it was stale. There was no crisp outside it was kind of soft and mushy on the outside.

0;I agree with other reviewers.<br />19$ is just too high price for a 6pck 2oz enfamil premium newborn nursette set.<br />This is available at less than 9$ elsewhere.<br />You can get a set of 48 from enfamil for 68$ only.<br />There is something seriously wrong with this deal and Amazon should really do something about it.
0;This item is NOT READY to use when the nipples are not included! Advertise product better!!! Shame on the product AND web site for not advertising newborn baby formula better!!!!! There is a photo of nipples but they are not included. This put me in a difficult position.
0;You can purchase a case with 48 bottles from Enfamil directly for $68.00 with free standard shipping.  Charging almost $20 for 6 bottles is not fair to new parents who are sleep deprived.  Seriously? This is a joke.  Babies R Us usually also has this item in stock.
0;This is not the specific product that I ordered. I actually selected an organic product.  This product makes my dog sick and she has the symptoms warned by the FDA for jerky products imported from China.  The label does not say where the product is made which leads my vet to conclude it is from China. I would not use it and would check other products from this maker.
0;My beans were not fresh when thery arrived. The oil was gone from the outside and they didn't have that wonderful aroma that they normally have when I open the bag. I think its best to buy your beans locally if you want them to be their freshest.
0;Why ruin great Irish oatmeal with additives that could be derived from GMO sources. It popped up in my recommended items and I ordered it without checking ingredients. Big mistake. I can't risk eating it since I can't eat anything from GMO corn or soy.There are other good organic oatmeals out there that don't add questionable ingredients.
0;"""Soooo kcups are super expensive. Why buy them?? Celestial seasonings comes in individual tea bags -  pillow  tea bags...I just set the tea bag in the cup & use the Keurig to heat the water and dispense into the cup. MUCH CHEAPER!

The earth will love you for it as well.<br /><br />BTW the Ekobrew filter was only $12 vs the other kcup filter that runs about $20 AND I have never had a mess problem with it like reviewers of the other kcup filter.<br /><br />Ohhh and to review the tea only takes two words...awesomely delicious (okay a made word and a real one).

0;Normally with Jelly Belly beans I never worry about put more then 1 in my month at once. These however don't mix with each other and are pretty bad by themselves.

0;I found this a few days ago when I was looking for a good snack to have around the house for not a whole lot of money.  The package came today.  I opened it up and had a few nuts.  they were chewy and smelled a bit off- both signs of staleness.  I checked the expiration date: 6/17/2012... It didn't make sense.  so I had a few more and wondered how I could make them palatable.  Eventually I came across some forums that said that staleness in nuts was the result of the oil turning rancid and hence is non-reversible.  Not to be defeated by something i bought to save money I did some more digging and found a forum that said that if you heat nuts at 350 for 10 minutes you can bring some life back into them.  I tried it and they came out burnt.  Tried again for 5 minutes instead of 10 and it worked.  They weren't perfect but they were crunchy and palatable which was a step up.  I give these 2 stars instead of 1 since they can be partially salvaged.  Too bad Amazon doesn't take returns on food.<br /><br />edit:<br />I just threw up.  I'm throwing these out and changing the review to one star.  Don't buy these if you value your GI tract.
0;"""I ordered this product 4 days ago. I received various  order update  emails telling me that it would arrive by tomorrow. I just got an email out of nowhere with a cancellation message and no other explanation other than that I could reorder it."""

0;I ordered this three times to be delivered to three different people for Valentine's day.  They had run a special promotion just for this occasion.  All three orders were canceled.  Seems like the should be ready for the increased demand a promotional price would cause.  At least I learned of this a day beforehand as opposed to my friend who found out Valentine's day their orders would not be delivered.
0;I had  purchased 4 doz roses for my wife for Valentines Day. They told me they had made a price mistake and wanted to charge me 3x the amount of money. Sounds like another bait and switch scheme to me. Don't Falcon have competent employees working there? Why don't people take time to PROOF READ their web site before making it public. I  am extremely dissatisfied. Falcon never apologized or made it right.
0;The title says it all!  The outside of the box was marked white but when it was finally opened there was rye inside.  I bought a bread machine and the Hodgson's in July but did not use them until I moved in December.  Now I'm stuck with bread mixes I won't use.  Let this warn everyone to look inside a shipping box even if it is marked as the item you ordered.
0;We tried this sauce and it had a very unpleasant sour taste. We thought it was the tomatoes so we removed them and tried again it turns out that it's not the tomatoes it's the paste. I went online and found another review [...] I wish I found this before :P. will look for another tikki masala sauce!
0;The marketing on this is very misleading. Having the Taco Bell brand on it would make anyone buying this product assume that it would taste like Taco Bell's cheese sauce. The same cheese sauce that they use in the restaurants and put on burritos and nachos. The truth is far from that assumption. In fact it tastes nothing like the nacho cheese sauce served in the restaurants. This is a very thick cheese sauce. When you spoon it out of the jar it leaves the indentions from the scoop in place. It's that thick. It does thin out some when heated. It also has a strong fake cheese flavor. You can doctor it up so to speak and use it as a base to make a better queso using extra melted cheese and milk.
0;"""This product is terrible. It's more freeze dried apple peels that apples. I ate a couple bites and had to throw the rest away (Amazon has a  no return policy  for this product). I prefer the thicker slices that Costco sells. Unfortunately with Costco's box you get half banana/strawberry (not my fav). I might try another brand thru Amazon but I'm not really happy with the no return policy."""

0;When my regular buffalo jerky was discontinued from the subscribe & save program I chose this item.  I have had & enjoyed other Golden Valley products in the past so I chose this one without reading the reviews.  I was very disappointed.  I have never been one for reconstructed meat.  I never read the fine print-this purchase was my fault for not reading everything-I saw buffalo & peppered & got excited.  The pepper flavor is very weak and unexciting.  If you like reconstructed meat with very little pepper flavor then this is the item for you!
0;"""in that my bags don't break down at all.  I put them in my compost pile each week but over time (approaching 9 months since I put the first bag in) I've ended up with a compost pile consisting of about 40 intact bags - like having 40 separate compost piles.  I actually had to take the waste out of each bag and mix everything then throw out the bags themselves in the garbage.  I'll just get normal small trash bags at this point and empty the waste out of those each week.  That's what I've ended up doing with the  compostable  bags but at a lot higher price.<br />I wished they worked ..."""
0;These trash bags did not come close to fitting my 2.5 gallon bath trash can.  They did not fit and they were cheaply made.  I paid a big price for 25 trash bags.  I would send them back if I did not have to pay postage.<br />Plastic grocery bags are much more effective and thicker.

She made another cup and put another pod in with the first one and used less water - and it was still weak! She came up after that and made this coffee"
0;I HAVE PURCHASED NUMEROUS WALNUTS FROM AMAZON BY DIFFERENT VENDORS AND THEY WERE GREAT.  THESE WERE AWFUL.  I PUT THEM IN THE FREEZER BEFORE I OPENED THEM FOR FRESHNESS.

0;K-Cups are defective. Filter collapses and you get a cup full of grounds or a partial cup of coffee. Whwen you try to remove the K-Cup it makes a huge mess dripping grounds and coffee all over everything. Called Tomothy's customer service three times and you get an anwering machine and they DO NOT RESPOND to your complaints. My Kuerig works perfectly with four other brands so it is definitely a defective product.

0;ehhh this is barely edible to me. It has a very strong 'smoked' flavor to it that is overwhelming to me... it taste like I imagine slightly burnt split pea soup would taste like. That said the first time I made it the aroma was good... not that it matters when all the other flavors are ruined by the smokiness.

0;"""... before they started using white sugar in all of their recipes.<br />(You can just skip to the last paragraph if you don't care to read the whole thing).<br /><br />Let me preface: A comment under one of my recent reviews challenged my credibility and accused me of 'not being discriminating enough"
0;I tried these mints and found the aroma to be wonderful. The taste however leaves something to be desired. I found it too much like eating something dunked in perfume. The aftertaste was also a bit unpleasant. Not something I will purchase again.
0;Be aware that these treats are made in China. We received them as a Christmas gift for our dogs and one of our dogs started having petit mal seizures about once a week after Christmas. We couldn't figure out what was going on but when a friend pointed out that these treats were from China we tossed them real fast and sure enough the seizures have stopped. Of course I can't prove that the seizures were caused from these treats but I can't help think there's a connection.
0;What is shown in the picture is a 900g can of Nido.  What you actually get is a 360g can.  Deceptive.<br /><br />Note that this is a review of the product as depicted.  Nido as a dried milk is quite good.
0;Wheat free does not equal gluten free. Placing an item of this description in this category can be extremely dangerous for those of us who are very sensitive to gluten. I would not want to take responsibility for this error.
0;The title for this product says gastrointestinal HE. This particular listing is for gastrointestinal Fiber Response! Please read product details if you intend on buying this product. I had to return it. It comes up in all my searches for HE gastrointestinal cat food but as I've said that is not what this is.
0;The product is ACTUALLY Royal Canin HF (HIGH FIBER) for constipated cats. HE is for cats with gastrointestinal problems. i.e. almost the opposite. The site also comes up with HF when you type in HE for the search. Others have noted this error and the company has ignored them. That would discourage me from buying ANYTHING from them. Very sloppy of them.
0;Its the day before Easter.  My Dad has Celiac sprue disease..NO GLUTEN.  Imagine my shock when after I had ordered these to MAKE HIS pies....I see wheat listed.  Can you imagine if I Didn't double check the ingredients and just went ahead?  He would have been SO sick....and it would have been my fault.<br /><br />PULL THIS FROM GLUTEN FREE PRODUCTS!<br /><br />NOT TO MENTION...I MAKE MY OWN WHEAT LADEN GRAHAM CRACKER CRUSTS....not happy...not happy at all.
0;The ingredients listed for this product prominently include wheat flour.  Foods that contain wheat flour are never gluten free.  People with celiac disease will definitely get the owie tummy if they eat this.<br /><br />CONTAINS WHEAT. NOT GLUTEN FREE!
0;"""These pickles are pickled in acetic acid even though the label in English reads brine in large print implying that they are pickled in brine. The can's small print (which is NOT visible in the picture) does report the truth. The use of brine instead of vinegar as a pickling agent results in a tremendous difference in taste. I'm stuck with 12 cans of pickles in vinegar (acetic acid). Vinegar pickles I can get anywhere"
0;"""I likewise have my doubts that I got the right tea even though it says Golden Mango on the box and individual packages.  It does not remotely taste like mango and is somewhat bitter.  I can't identify the taste"
0;Got it for my German Shepherd and Lab Retriever.  They loved the taste and it did give them some pop but over time that wore away and the returned to normal.  I would not recommend this for large dogs.
0;"""I hate this company right now. I've sent them over 5 yes 5 emails about the fact that they sent me the wrong airbrush colors and still nothing!!! The colors cost over 29$ so you can understand why I'm mad. I mean really? it might not be a big deal to the company but it is to me. I mean make a mistake"
0;"""Treats smell so good I would like to eat them myself. They are manufactured in China and they look shiny on the outside and I am not sure how that happens to the chicken and the company has not responded to my questions about this. I have concerns because of China's reputation"
0;"""I used to buy Manuka honey from a distribution who got it from NZ right off the ship. Manuka honey has a very specific taste and dark in color. You feel like eating something precious. This jar was tinted dark brown to resemble a dark Manuka honey in the picture"
0;"""This company is basically selling ordinary honey from bees that may get some of their nectar from the wild-growing manuka plant but that does not make it  Manuka Honey .   Bio-Active  is not UMF.  A rating of 5 means it's useless anyway. Amazon should refuse to sell this."""
0;I had hoped when I bought it that it would replace the original Chicken Free Ramen soup but it's as horrible as the new chicken free soup. I loved the original and I do not understand why they would replace it with these vegan soups that just plain taste awful.<br />My advice-save your money.
0;The flavor is pretty rough.  Some of the other chicken flavor ones taste better.  A big issue with these cups for me is that the paper cups start to burn in the microwave when cooked at the printed directions.  It's not an issue with my microwave.  I've never run into this problem with any other pre-packaged food or most of the other products from this brand.  I'm not sure how safe that is to eat.  The company makes some good food - try the pilaf or noodle cups.  They are much better than the soups.
0;"""I really wanted to like these because I love edamame and I'm always looking for healthy snacks I can keep tucked away in my office (for afternoon 'munchy' emergencies)!  I bought this along with the 'Roasted Veggies' mix of which I will review separately because I had a much better experience with those.<br /><br />The flavor itself isn't bad but the freeze drying technique just doesn't translate well for these soybeans.  It was like popping a handfull of sponges and dry chalk into my mouth.  Chewing on a bunch of these will instantly dry out your mouth and the resulting texture/mouthfeel is uncomfortable and well... unpleasant.<br /><br />As another reviewer suggested"
0;This is a waste of money if you are looking for the french vanilla flavor it just doesn't have any.  I ended up giving away 5 of the 6 cans.  The mocha by Folger's is excellent and you can taste the chocolate.  I thought the french vanilla would be the same but it was just a sweet coffee.  I purchased the Victorian Inn brand and from the reviews this has a good vanilla taste
0;I've used this product over the past few days and it has had no effects on my eyes.  I visited my doctor a few months back because I have a bag under one eye that only shows when I smile.  My doctor says that it didn't form because of premature aging but b/c of the way I sleep.  I thought that this cream would work resolve the issue but it hasn't had any effect on my undereye bag.
0;"""I wanted to try the products from 100% pure. The eye cream I ordered made my eyes swell up really bad. I contacted the company via e-mail to find out how to return it. I followed their directions and mailed it all back to them with a copy of the e-mail. I did not hear from them"
0;I purchased this tea when my other Jasmine tea was out of stock. I found the Jasmine flavor in this brand very lacking... compared to my other tea - even when I increased the number of tea bags and brewing time per cup.
0;"""I got these grapes as a gift.  Upon opening the box I had no idea what I was getting...and then I opened a ziploc of a handful of grapes that say  FRESH RED GRAPES  in sharpie marker on the bag.  These were not sent priority mail nor was there an ice pack with them.  If someone is selling grapes I would at least expect them to come in some sort of packaging.  Also"
0;I think any product on sale to our American consumers should have the point of origin clearly published PRIOR to sale.  Point in question is a Polar product offering cherry pie filling (made in China).  I would not have known except for the reviews.  Just my opinion
0;"""You can't fool me. I own a dog and I can tell you the quality of the beef in this product is most definitely dogfood. The smell and texture is distinctly that of canned wet dogfood. The taste is like that of nothing I've ever tasted in the  beef  category. Only God knows what I actually ate. I will no longer buy my dog that canned stuff ever again"
0;We love these flatbreads and the store where we purchased them quit selling them so I was so glad to see that Amazon had them. Promptly ordered them and when they arrived each one was broken in at least 4 pieces. Imagine sending a box of crackers  through the mail with no padding and what you get is six boxes of broken pieces!! Very disappointed
0;When I was a little kid my sister gave me a dollar to eat<br />one our dog's biscuits.  I was brought back to that moment in<br />time today when I ate one of these Doctor Kracker Pumpkin Cheddar Flatbreads.<br />I'm not proud of what I did to receive that dollar when I was a little kid.<br />But you should save your dollars and buy something that tastes good.
0;"""I expected the product to be good like other plum organic products. But this stinks and smells burnt food. My baby threw up once i fed her a spoon. I did taste and  eek  terrible. I thought the problem was with specific pack.. but no.. the product is bad.."""
0;Let me first start off by saying I purchased this to try something different to fry with and it was different. That being said the flavor was pretty bad and the smell was even worse. It was my own bad thinking I was getting more than I did for the value but that being said I still feel the dollar per oz is very high.<br /><br />In short this entire purchase left a bad taste in my mouth.
0;"""I have been recently diagnosed with Rosacea and was told to remove many potential triggers from my diet. I'd replace this cracker with a spoon...rather than pile on anything to make these edible. Sad part is I hoped my purchase wasn't in vain"
0;Item different from website description.  Claims it colors 30 eggs...package received says it colors 6 eggs.  This packaging was not as shown. The product arrived in a make-shift envelope...even the label was crooked. I paid $5.02 for shipping and the product arrived in an envelope with one postage stamp.
0;Again this is good stuff but don't buy it here.  At my wal-mart I got this exact same thing for $3.98!!!!!!!!<br />$3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98 $3.98!!!!
0;I am disappointed these pumpkin seeds originated in China.  I have reservations about consuming food known to be from China given their recent incidents involving food safety. The fact the pumpkin seeds did not come from North America should have been noted in the product description.  I will return them or throw them out and will not order any food item from Woodstock Farms again.
0;"""I think maybe they got their tea mixed up in the coffee grinding machine.<br /><br />This is supposed to be  High-quality loose leaf tea leaves - Contains full tea leaves- much higher quality than most tea bags.   Well"
0;"""The packaging of the creamers did not hold up to the test of shipping.  About a quarter of the creamers were cracked open and covered the inside of the box.  They smell amazing but it doesnt out weigh the hour that it took to clean up and the 46 creamers I lost.  I do not blame Amazon.com"
0;Plain box with some cups glued to the sides with leaked product.  Outer packing box also wet with leaked product.  Bubble wrap inside the product box failed to prevent rupture.  Was told I would get a refund but the e-mail from Amazon indicates a replacement is being sent.<br /><br />I bought the same manufacturer's product (French Vanilla) at Costco in a nice retail dispenser package and have no problems.
0;I ordered these chocolate covered coffee beans for gifts ( I ordered 6 packages)...they came completely melted/ the box was hot and contained only one cold pack...it was all ruined.  I have contacted the company for a replacement or refund..total waste
0;"""I was very disappointed in this product.  The ingredients say that it contains either cornstarch or tapioca starch.  The one I got used tapioca and that might have made the difference.  The powdered sugar was like plaster"
0;FIVE GUM is wayy too chewy.  Felt like chewing rubber lettece--or my bouncy ball (see other review).  Absolutely ridickoulous.  Did not taste HALF as cool as the commerceial.  Only got 4 senses tingling.  Cannot store probably.  Came with wayy too many pieces of gum--HAD TO THROW SOME OUT.  All taste the same--absolutely ZERO varity.  NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.  Do not buy for your friends.
0;I was not happy with this purchase. The white chocolate chips must have melted and reformed because it was just one solid chunk...I made the recipe anyway (I chopped the chocolate) but it did not turn out well at all. The chocolate had separated.<br /><br />All three boxes of mix had the same problem.<br /><br />I'd like to try this mix again but I don't want to risk getting another bad batch of white chocolate.
0;"""My son does not like this new recipe. There aren't many snacks foods that he can have and he really enjoyed the old Caramel Apple Bars. So I bought a case of them thinking they were the same bars but in different packaging"
0;"""Wish I would have read other reviews before purchasing this. Should have known better than ordering a case of a product I had not tried.<br />*Seriously....the size is ridiculous for a  bar . I think a double-stuffed OREO is bigger.<br />* Hard as a rock"
0;I am a huge fan of Luna's but there are a few flavors that are just not that great. This being one of them. It does not have that peanut butter taste. It's kind of bland and just not great at all. The Nutz over chocolate has more of a peanut butter taste than this does.
0;I ordered a number of candies for a Christmas present and many were short dated or out of date. The curlywurlys are dated 11 2011 so were out of date when they arrived.<br />The Crunchies are dated 01 2012. I received them in 12/2011. The person I am getting these for will not eat anything out of marked date. Looking at the reviews I see I am not the first to report receiving old candy from them. One of the Cadbury Dairy Milk Mint Crisp had its wrapper mostly off and the foil was broken.<br />The company did agree to refund the Curlywurlys but not the Crunchies or Dairy Milk so poor customer service as well as poor inventory control. I would not purchase from them again.
0;"""I have not yet been able to produce a waffle we can eat using this mix.  The dough sticks to the waffle iron and then separates.  I called Heartland and was told that their waffle conditioner (which is called for in the directions) is for their commercial customers. I have been unable to locate a waffle  conditioner  locally - or anywhere else. The bag does warn that nonstick sprays will cause the waffles to stick - THEY DO!!!!  Also the pack of 6 makes way more waffles than a family of two needs.  Heartland said the shelf life is 6 months - a year if frozen.  We liked the waffles so much when we had them for breakfast in a hotel while we were travelling that we wanted to enjoy them at home.  We inquired and were told how to get the mix.  Serve was quick"
0;I have purchased this product before - but do not remember it being over $40 - for what appears to be 16 total servings of latte. It is $10.99 at the local grocer for this 8 serving pack. Other sellers have it even higher.
0;"""This is a ridiculous price for this product.  The only reason I can think that they are charging such a high price is because the latte and cappaccino products were recalled because of a few people getting burned.  I think the sellers who have the product are making people pay these crazy prices"
0;DH has Tassimo & loves cappuccino but he recently switched to the latte's as pricing in local stores (one with a T) began rising after the recall. You can get the latte locally at that red dot store for $8.Pricing is almost comical.
0;"""Thought I was doing a good thing for my doxie mix by getting one of the better brands as listed on dogfoodanalysis but boy was I mistaken. Gradually made the change from her old food to the new and she hates it. She has thrown up twice so far. I will be taking my loss and throwing the rest out. Back to her old food. It may be great for some dogs"
0;"""We've been buying this exact formula of Wellness for our Cocker Spaniel  Lucy  for over a year now.  We thought that it would be worth purchasing on Amazon since it was priced almost identically and it would be more convenient than going to Petsmart since it would be delivered to our front door.  We didn't receive the food for well over a week after we ordered it so we were forced to buy a small bag at the store until we received the food.  No big deal...we figured next time we'll just order it a couple of weeks in advance so that Lucy's food supply isn't as low and we have plenty until we get the next bag.  After feeding her two meals of the bag we got from Amazon"
0;My dog will not touch this food. Very surprised because all reviews were positive. He will not eat it with chicken added or anything else. I am aware of a recall on some of the Wellness brand but this food was not included in the recall.
0;"""Altoids shipped (I think). Shipper sent an email message  could not leave un attended . Called the number they provided and was confronted with an answering device that I could not understand. I think they want me to drive to jacksonville and pickup this small box of candy. I am old and handicapped and Jax is a half a tank of gas away. Looks like the system has beat me.<br />Billy Ray"""
0;The aftertaste of this gum is soooo bad and it took till the next day to go away.  It reminds me of the Ginger Dressing that comes on the salad you get at a Sushi place.  Don't recommend this gum at all.
0;I wanted to make a black and white cake so I got this at a store near me. As soon as I got home I sprayed a tiny bit on my hand and licked it. It smelled and tasted horrible. I threw it out within minutes of coming home from the store. I own quite a few Wilton products but would advise against getting the black spray.
0;I looked everwhere to change my daughter's birthday cake frosting black when the frosting was white.  This product sprays on and says it will give it a black color.  I followed the instructions perfectly and it gave it a grayish color only if you sprayed a bunch on.  The smell was awful and it looked awful.  Realizing it wasn't going to work I stopped and tried to scrape it off.  The entire cake absorbed the flavor - it was horrible and the cake ended up in the garbage.
0;DO NOT BUY THIS! Thought this was a great idea. sounded quick and a fun way to add color to cakes. It did give color to the cake but the smell was horrible. Smells<br />like hair spray. Not something I want to eat or let my children eat.
0;I ordered this product expecting to receive whole seeds as pictured. the mustard received was ground. If you are looking for whole mustard seeds DO NOT BUY. If you want ground then no issues with product
0;"""I used to use McCormick's Hunter Sauce mix and I just loved it.  When I found out that McCormick had discontinued it I thought that I would give the Knorr product a chance. I really tried to have a positive attitude but"
0;"""I ordered this Rougie GOOSE Foie Gras about a year ago and it was pretty good.  I went to my account and pulled up the exact same Rougie Goose Foie Gras that I had previously ordered.  The title at the top said  Rougie Goose Foie Gras . I did not look closely at the product assuming that the title was not a lie and because it was the same product that I previously ordered.  When it came"
0;Neither Amazon or the company who was suppose to send the product answered the question of who cancelled the order.<br /><br />I will have to think before I order from Amazon again.  They were not helpful and made it my responsibility to hold the company they sent the order to to figure out why it was cancelled.<br /><br />To date I still have no answer.  BUT I did get my refund back??????
0;"""I am in search of a good German Christmas stolen. Such a stolen should have powdered sugar on it and dried fruits inside. The consistency should be cake like and firm. This stolen was a complete waste of my money (with shipping"
0;First time buyer!  Product arrived and I opened it.  There was a seal over the top which I peeled off.  I was surprisd and shocked to find a hollow section in the jar.  About 25% of the jar was empty.  I feel ripped off!!!!!
0;"""I have been a celiac for 10 years and these cookies are behind the times.  I stopped buying gf specialty foods about 4 years ago - I gave up due to lack of flavor/odd tastes (beany) and grainy textures.<br />I have just started eating it again in the last 6-8 months because of the advances in popularity and therefore"
0;My dog is obsessed with fetching tennis balls so I wanted to teach her how to catch a frisbee. I figured something softer for her mouth would be good and based on other reviews this seemed durable. Unfortunately it took my 1 yr old cocker spaniel all of 15 minutes (no exageration)to chew through the edge where the rubber tubing is and shred this thing apart.
0;"""i have a subscription for re-order for this product. i received on of the two pails and it was leaking pink juice out of the package. i refused one of the two boxes and have not had a replacement sent. there is no available action for this problem and it also says non returnable"
0;I have purchased sugar free frenchvanilla cappuccino in the past tho not from this site...and it was way better than this. Extremely disappointed - not sweet enough - not enough creamer - not creamy at all -
0;"""I've used brining bags before so when I saw a good price on this 6 pack I thought I was doing myself a favor. I was dead wrong. Thanksgiving eve I went to turn my turkey over and the top opened up completely from the slightest movement. I had turkey brine spilling out into the fridge and all over the floor. Not something I needed to deal with when I was trying to get my pies baked and the table set.<br /><br />If I weren't a pregnant working mom of a toddler I would return these"
0;"""I didn't know they made a   Watered down cheap bubblegum   Flavor....They made a mistake and put the fruit punch label on my jug. I got the wrong flavor<br /><br />I use to love the taste of the first Supercharge 2005-2008 humanofort formula (Tasted awesome) and then the Supercharge Xtreme came out 2008-2010 humanofort formula(Tasted very good) and now we have Supercharge Xtreme without humanofort and different formula all together (tasted decent) and now the batches from a year later (Taste like crap) what is up with the flavor Labrada? Fruit Punch? taste like chemical bubble gum and the flavoring system here is very weak"
0;"""The fruit punch is a watered down cheap bubblegum taste. Not to the standards of the older Supercharge formula with good fruit punch taste. This isn't fruit punch. They should call it  Watered down Cheap bubblegum  Flavor<br /><br />Labrada = FAIL"""
0;I don't care for this flavor. The Orange Powder is finer and more dense than the Grape and Punch. You have to use twice the amount of water and It doesn't dissolve well. It taste like ground Vitamin C Pills and has a brownish color when mixed. Maybe I got a bad batch. Grape is the Best.
0;Nescafe Classic is Nescafe Classic.There is NO Greek Nescafe.You can use ANY Nescafe Classic to make 'frappe' if you want. You can use Nescafe Clasico (sold by Amazon LLC for $ 18.65 for 3 glass jars of 7 ounce each and free shipping) and it is way cheaper than this tinny Greek product and it is 100% the same Nescafe Classic sold all over the world. There is no need/reason to pay this much for the same product.<br /><br />People who have never tasted good instant coffee I recommend Nescafe Gold. Not sold in the US but known and enjoyed by millions around the world.
0;"""Das Salt fleur de sel is the best of those I've tried. Awesome as finishing salt and a touch on chocolate ice cream can't be beat.<br /><br />Update 5/10/2011:  Amazon will not let me delete the review I wrote in 2010 (it keeps the date) and start over"
0;I was extremely disappointed with this plant.  I feel it was not represented correctly...very small...healthy but did not make a Mother's Day gift at all.  I never gave it to my Mother as I was embarrassed to do so.  Never purchase again.
0;"""My dog never even attempted to play or chew on this toy. I think it is too hard which gives her no desire to chew on it because who would want to chew on a rock... well she does prefers rocks over this toy. This was a waste of my money"
0;"""I did not like this chew bone AT ALL. My poor lab's mouth started bleeding after just chewing a few minutes. My daughter noticed pink in her mouth. After checking the bone I decided to return it. The nubs on the end turned pointed immediately causing the bleeding. I like Nylabone products"
0;"""These are totally disgusting!  This is the second time I have tried them because I really wanted to like them.  I have read so many good reviews and Hungry Girl strongly recommends them.  I am not a picky eater at all"
0;"""Only if you can stomach a raw smelly fish smell when you open the package and the rubbery noodle texture that doesn't go away with chewing should you order these.  I made the mistake of ordering 10 and threw most away after trying to do something with them twice.  These noodles were like eating rubber bands -- NASTY and look like clear tapeworms.  I tried cutting them"
0;"""Tried these and they are so totally GROSS.  Don't believe the rave reviews.  These are NOTHING like spagetti noodles and no matter how you cook them - will never be like spagetti noodles.  My whole family tried them but the funniest was my husbands reaction.... I didn't tell him what they were and he took a big bite.....  Did you see the movie  BIG  with Tom Hanks when he ate the caviar... well that was my husband -- so while it was a HUGE waste of money.... that was almost priceless...It is worst thing I have ever tried.  I agree with the others about the fishy smell. never goes away but the texture is Like eating  jellyfish tentacles  - and they look like jellyfish tentacles as well.<br /><br />I am passing these on to the trashcan and hope the seagulls like them...."""
0;"""I know why they have zero calories/carbs etc... Its because this is not food. It tastes like nothing and the texture is utterly revolting. If you are someone who is sensitive to textures of foods (mushrooms"

Thanks for the tip on the Keebler Zesta crackers - I'm about to give them a try."""
0;"""i've been feeding my cats wellness for over six tears. i tried for a change. they weren't at all fond of this food. and as i read in other reviews they tended to leave the chunks of fruit and veggies behind in the bowl. i only fed them about a fourth of the bag"
0;I needed some steak seasoning and this sounded great in the reviews. It is horrid! It is just a boatload of salt with a little flavor. Really gross in my opinion.<br />I will stick to Emerils steak seasoning any day!

NO WAY!"""
0;"""New Coke?...seems the Cytosport folks are going to have to learn this lesson the hard way.  I'll not purchase Cytomax again until they return to the old formula or at least improve the  new  one as it currently tastes terrible."""
0;"""A year ago I bought the Citrus flavor and it was quite good! But recently I bought the  new formula  doesn't dissolve nearly as well! (it clumps and sticks to the glass/water bottle) and its taste leaves much to be desired!  I'm really disappointed in the new formula and I wouldn't recommend it!"""
0;"""It is always a huge disappointment when a product that you have relied on for years destroys its merits in search of a new image. Cytomax has ruined a good product with the  remake  it has imposed on its product line. It is now made with an artificial sweetener (Stevia) and has a quite different taste and different nutritional values. I will not buy this new version."""
0;Just received this item in the mail seconds ago.  It shows two tins and is titled 2x on my order sheet but read carefully because you only get one tin and it is whichever one they decide to send you.  I saw these identical tins last night at Toys R Us for $1.98 each.  These prices are totally inflated and the photo is misleading.  I bought three (I thought 3 sets) and ended up paying $17.97 for three of these small tins!  Live and learn!

0;Don't waste your money on this product.  Within  24 hours it killed all five varities of flowers we had planted a week earlier.  We had to go out and buy and plant all new flowers.  Big waste of time along with the money.
0;I read the reviews on this first and thought that sounds good.  I don't understand why people rated this as really good.  This stuff tastes really bad.  It reminded me of the stuff they make you drink before a colonoscopy.
0;"""I was really excited that coconut water came in flavors because I was getting tired of drinking it plain. I thought this would have a subtle flavoring but it is way too strong and it tastes terrible. The worst part is Amazon won't even let you return it. So much for companies standing behind their products. I would not recommend this to anyone"
0;I love regular Wheat Thins so I wanted to try this Multi-Grain kind. Bad idea. These have no taste - it's like eating thin pieces of cardboard. Yes it's healthier than the original but so what. I really can't stand the taste of these and had to give them away to friends - I'm not sure if they ate it. I won't be buying this variety of Wheat Thins again.
0;"""I'm not sure how these treats can be advertised as made in America when the back of the bag very clearly says (albeit in tiny print)  MADE IN CHINA . I wouldn't mind this so much except that to date 360 dogs have died from consuming pet jerky made in China. It's mostly chicken jerky"

0;I am a big fan of both cashews and Dark chocolate. This product did not taste like either. I am so disappointed. You can tell that they are cashews by sight. But they taste nothing like them at all. The Chocolate? What chocolate? The product looks like cashews held together with the slightest amount of what may be chocolate but there is so little it could be cocoa powder cornstarch and water. then when the mix dries it is cut into these tiny squares. Perhaps 5 pieces per pack. Your money is all going into the fancy packaging. With such little product why should you need a resealable pouch with a humidity packet inside. Ridiculous!!
0;"""Found out afterward that the FDA has issued a warning on chicken jerky products made in China. Over 200 dogs have become sick or died due to poisoning. The warning has been out since 2007 but apparently"
0;Nasty. Just nasty. The lack of artificial sweetener makes this cocoa-y without that nice sweet finish that usually comes with chocolate ice cream. Had a weird aftertaste and was hard as a rock out of the freezer. Very chalky texture as well. I will never eat this again.
0;Very disappointed with this item.  It arrived very quickly but it is small and tips over easily when you lift the dispensing handle.  The mouth opens to dispense the candy but then doesn't close as the M&M's are all stuck in the mouth. Will be returning this item.

0;Real kettle popcorn is sweetened with sugar and is a real tasty snack.<br />Unfortunately sugar burns in the microwave so Orville Redenbacher (ConAgra Foods) have sweetened this with sucralose.<br />Sucralose is definitely something I wouldn't give to my kid.  Read all about it online.
0;I have been ordering this product for my chihuahua for years. She loves these treats. The only reason I have stuck with these is because they are made in the USA. I just received 2 16 oz packages and read the label (Made in China). I am very disturbed by this finding and will be discarding all of these treats. I will no longer be ordering these in the future and neither will any of my Family and Friends. Amazon needs to look into this. I noticed a huge difference in the looks of the item and feel Amazon has let me down.
0;What a scam!This was nothing more than the regular Kraft cheese whiz you get off the shelf today- and for more money!! NOT the original recipe. I got my hopes up but was duped.  Kraft continues to cheapen their products and they have lost me as a customer.

Now I don't know what to do with the rest of it.  I don't know if there was a problem in the manufacturing of the glass"
0;I tried this hoping that it would be another good GF staple in my pantry. I didn't like it as well as the other brand I buy. I combined the cooked pasta with a homemade GF cheese sauce and it was by far the worst GF Mac n' Cheese I've ever made. The pasta didn't combine with the sauce at all. I am going back to my tried and true Quinoa pasta.

0;the price is good but the coffee is a crap shoot.Sometimes it is fine and sometimes it is out of date and the pods are swollen and brew at a slooooow pace. very frustrating and the coffee quality at that stage is poor. I never have time to return and I am not sure how to work Amazon or who is actually selling to me. The procust is poor quality about 50% of the time. I will not order anymore. Good luck. No place to get a reply or response so this is the only avenue I see.
0;I ordered these capsules to go with the Krups Nescafe Dolce Gusto one cup coffee maker that I purchased from Amazon.  Unfortunately I have to return the coffee maker (unless they take other coffee pods NOT made by Nescafe) The coffee from these pods taste terrible and one out of five pods used so far are defective duds! They are filled with only powdered milk (yuck) and no coffee or cocoa.  I don't know about the other one cup coffee pods but these are definitely instant coffee in a pod. Heck I can pick up some Taster's Choice and powdered creamer and save me a lot of mess and money! I wish the manufacturer would specify that these capsules contain instant coffee and not ground coffee.  I still do not know if the other coffee pods contain instant or real coffee.
0;I ordered 5 bags of 5 pounds each. Half of each bag arrived broken.  We did not have enough to use for our wedding so we didn't use any of them. I flew back from our wedding contacted the seller and they would not give us a refund.
0;"""What a waste...I bought these Lindt Truffles to put in a goody bag for my annual bash.  I was so excited when it came in as I opened the package I saw grease stains had saturated the plastic wrapped truffle box.  As I opened one of them up I was horrified to see each and every one of the White Chocolate Truffles had melted and leaked all over the box.  I didn't even bother to open the other box because it was in the same leaky state.  I quickly called Amazon to let them know"
0;"""The chocolate had softened then re-hardened at some point between factory production and getting to me. It's possible they were boxed up as failed quality control stock and then sold to Amazon. Who knows? Because of this"
0;These are my favorite of the gluten free pretezels but they are expensive. So I decided to order a case from Amazon. I was VERY disappointed when the package arrived. They sent the regular pretzels and further the order said no returns. I called and they did refund my money but did not offer to send me the right product. I would rather have had the sesame pretzel rings I ordered. I won't order anything else bulk from here. I have had such good luck ordering from Amazon I was really disappointed with this order and Amazon :(  I gave a one star on the review because I did not get the product I ordered. The pretzels are a 5 star in my book.
0;"""The brine was overly sweetened and the product was just not good at all. There was nothing  pickled  about this product. It was just a sticky unpleasant tasting mess. I threw them out. I would not buy again nor would I recommend them to anyone."""
0;I ordered these last Sunday morning and they were delivered by UPS today.  What a mess!  They were all melted into a liquid glob.  First time that I have not been satisfied.  Will try to get this resolved.
0;Cracked olives should not result in small bits of olive pits.  Most of these olives have bits of broken bits from the cracking process.  The spice and oil mix is ok but not pleasant.  A bit on the mushy side as well.  I was disappointed.

0;it's so unique getting the scoby that it's not even in the packaging and i don't care what the reason is. you can't show a picture and then the product that<br />i'm paying money for isn't in the packaging. i came to my senses since you can by a scoby for how much? i like to be fooled and maybe you do too. so please go<br />blow 45 dollars on a glass jar to then be told of some free claim for a scoby. no thanks.
0;"""The rice itself is not bad at all. But there is nothing spectacular about it. This small bag of rice is not worth the price they charge for shipping. Only get it if you have free shipping (7.80 is alot). I thought it would have some type of slightly different taste being organic but whatever. There is not even a huge difference in the production of this brown rice and other short grain brown rices. I would suggest that unless the shipping price goes below $2.25"
0;I was looking to try some premium nuts that gave me more than what I could obtain at a regular Grocery store.  The packaging is beautiful and you are sure you are in for a treat.  However at least a quarter of the nuts were not open and so tough to try to open that it was easier to just throw them away.  The size ranged from extra large (maybe 15%) to small (most of these unopened).  In conclusion this product was far worse than even the most commmon grocery brands.  The person in charge of quality control was probably at the dentist getting their chipped tooth fixed after trying to open some of these nuts.
0;Very unhappy with purchase.  These taste awful.  Remind me of the cheap boxed salad crutons that used to be popular in the 1980s.  Even though they are gluten free they remind me of dried out bread.  And the flavor is not similar to white cheddar (not sure what it is).  I have purchased other Kay's products (lemon herb chips are great!).  [...]

0;This is a great idea for a treat given with the bone but the issue is they come out too quickly and now this is the third time my dog has swallowed the treat and choked  They tend to be too hard and unfortunately my dog tries to eat them too fast.  Other products seem to be safer so we will toss these away for something my dog will not choke on!
0;had a good taste going down but a nasty aftertaste. and the so called caffeine did not give me energy but may have been the cause for the nasty taste. didnt see an improvement in anything. wont buy again!

The taste was so bad and the greasy texture such a turn off that my guests were actually spitting the peanut butter into napkins.<br /><br />I called the company and was told that the product needed to be refrigerated and then STIRRED. I has already stirred the peanut butter when we opened the containers due to the oils being on the top"

One would think that a flower company - whose products are primarily directed at women - would have been the first advertiser to withdraw their advertising.  Sadly"
0;This cider is pretty gross.  I actually ordered multiple types/flavors but none of them were any good.  If you select the largest cup size on the Kureg then you get a watered-down mess.  Even with the smaller sizes it tastes way too sweet an the fke sugar sweetener makes me gag.  Recommend people who do not like coffee to stick to the tea flavor K-cups.
0;"""i really wanted to like this. i'm a baker and always looking for new better ways to get vanilla and this seemed amazing. i was really disappointed. its like a sugary syrup with a very faint vanilla taste. ever used pure vanilla bean? the vanilla taste should be intense. this wasn't. i also tried buying vanilla powder from williams sanoma and that was even a bigger waste of money. omg it was like they just ground up the peels or something because it had NO flavor and hardly any smell. what a disappointment. so i continue on my search. i saw this website called Vanilla Man that i want to check out. He's in Africa i think. so i'm hoping that will be the real deal. he has vanilla syrups"

0;Between my wife and myself we during at least 6 cappuccino's per day. I have ordered Coffee Bean Direct several times and the product is great. Amazon has gone to FedEx for shipping and they are the worst.  What used to take one day with UPS now takes 4 days with Fedex.<br />This is the last time I buy this from Amazon!!
0;I found a recommendation of Honest Tea in a book and wanted to try some.  Thought that $ 34.99 for 12 ($2.92 each) was a lot of money but the stuff is all natural.  But then I bought 3 bottles at a local gas station for $2.09 each.  If it can be bought a a gas station convenience store for less than amazon there is a problem.

0;Product was old.  Some liquid in the cans was separated with an off smell.  Several cans were downright rancid.  All was thrown out.  I will order from another supplier (Gristedes of New York) next time.
0;"""I gave this as part of a secret santa gift for someone who loves to make guacamole. I was suprised to see that it's a condiment that you must refrigerate and use within a few days once opening rather than a dry seasoning. I paid too much for it given the cost of shipping only to find it available at my local Waldbaums supermarket. I bought some for myself to taste what I had given as a gift and was simply not at all impressed by the flavor it added. This surprised me as I have seen Chef Bayliss' show on tv and expected something more. I should have known better. Guacamole isn't difficult.

0;I always enjoy Senseo's coffee and have tried Breakfast Blend before. Showhow these batch I received wasn't very good. Makes me think of the coffee I get from gas station... Although fresh out but tasteless.<br /><br />And Amazon doesn't allow return of these!
0;"""I am completely disappointed in this product. Got the machine at a second hand store to try it out. Let's make it short and say save your money.

SO if you smell dry cereal or grain instead of rich sweet coffee before you brew it"
0;"""then this isn't for you. Horrible after bite that gives it a unique flavor that I definately don't care for...not to say that you will not however. If you are in search of a generic oriented flavored coffee"
0;I bought this coffee based on the reviews that I read. This is one of the weakest coffees that I had ever tasted. I had to use two pods to taste the hazelnut and vanilla essence. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. What a waste!!!!
0;"""I bought these pods on Amazon because they were a dollar cheaper than at the local grocery store.  Now I know why.  When I opened the package the Senseo Watermark was faint or hardly visable and it took me 3x the amount of pods to make a decent cup of coffee.  Buyer beware"
0;"""When in the hell did this coffee skyrocket it's prices??<br />Previously we had bought some for the same price as all their other flavors (around 36 bucks or so).<br />Now this medium roast is over 95 dollars for the same thing??

0;I don't know why you are asking for a review.  I sent an email regarding the shipment and included a photo of the box a few weeks ago after the shipment arrived. No one has responded.  The shipment came and all eight of the jars were not sealed and leaked out in the box.  I did not refuse the box because I didn't want to wait for another shippment.  Now I wish I had returned it.
0;The box arrived dripping with oil<br /><br />All the Jars had spewed thier contents- the seal had broken under the lid- I can only assume this happened as a consequence of an unpressurized cargo  hold in  flight.<br /><br />So- I wasted the entire amount I spent.<br /><br />Don't buy this!!!!!!!
0;"""This product is not good when compares to the one I brought form Whole Food. My eyes were not dry and the dark spots on my eyes were gone after I took the bottle from Whole Food but the one I ordered from Amazon did not work.

Her dark spots came back and her eyes feel dry again.<br /><br />Worst of all I want to return the one bottle I ordered earlier"
0;The worst product that I every bought I vow to never buy anything from this site ever again. It tasted horrible and doesn't mix with anything. I have to throw the whole thing away what a waste of money. Never recommend this for anybody.
0;all this powder does is float in the liquid- It doesn't mix with it at all.  So you drink dust powder AND liquid rather than a new mixed drink.  Secondly - Doesn't taste good at all.  Won't be buying again.
0;This product is poorly packaged Of the bottles that arrived four were broken and I paid for twelve.  This is not the first time foods has arrive in leaking containers.  I do not intend to order any thing in a glass bottle or in liquid form as due to packaging you waste your money
0;we had tried freeze dried apples at the office and they went off the shelf like crazy! Loved them! and then we tried CRUNCHIES BRAND. They are certainly not crunchy. Soggy and they tasted like they were old. We were exceptionally dissapointed returned them back to amazon. People that recommend this have no taste what so ever!!!
0;I bought these - based on the great reviews.<br />They're horrible - taste artificially sweetened and there's a powdery substance left in the bag.<br />I wish I hadn't bought these...waste of money.<br />If they weren't so expensive I'd just throw the rest away...
0;This product is no Good you need and have to go to where they package..They don't even have health permit to package at the wearhouse and people still buy...Very unhealthy with no health permits at all. Please be carefull with this product very unhealthy..
0;I have been unable to find the old recipe/box in stores so I was SO EXCITED when I saw these online so I ordered two of them..  I was SO disappointed to find out that they are not the original cracker and are the second version/recipe of the cracker which I do not like at all..  A slight variance but it's no good now to me...  So now I'm stuck with a LOT of crackers I do not like.
0;Once upon a time this was such a wonderful product.<br /><br />The old Chocolate Twizzlers were much stronger in many ways. Taste yes and also in product 'behavior'.... The old product was 'tough' to pull apart... it actually had a 'snap' to it... This new 'stuff' behaves more like play-dough -- really 'squishy' and not in a good way. :)<br /><br />All I want to know is who is responsible for such a blunder and have they been fired yet? (kidding / well sorta)<br /><br />Dave<br /><br />Okay... I can't believe they (may have) actually listened!  I got a letter from Nestle back in Dec 2011 that they've reversed their changes to this great product and to look for new packages that have the tag line NOW WITH THE CLASSIC TWIST...  Well being in the middle of a home sale / purchase and all that goes along with that ... Chocolate Twizzlers weren't at the top of my priority... However now I'm going out to find a bag with the new tag line and I'll report back ASAP.  With any luck this 1 star review will be reissued as a 5 star. ... Fingers crossed.
0;A few months ago I wrote a email to Hershey about the new taste of their chocolet twizzlers and I told them why did they change the taste of them. They told me that they did not know of any other complaints and also sent me some coupons so I can get some free bags. But I told them in another email that I did not need their coupons because I was not going to purchase them again. I told them that as a kid I always loved to eat them and enjoyed the taste. Why in the world would someone decide to change them and even the texture was horrible like jello...so a few days ago I receive a letter from Hershey telling me that because of my letter and other feed back from others they're now bringing back the chocolet twizzlers as the classic. They sent me some free coupons..they could not of made mt day....just hope that they are as good as the original and to make sure I buy the ones that say classic on them. I am truly glad that there is a least one company that listens to the consumer...
0;"""What happened ?! The previous open ended chewy actual chocolate tasting twizzlers were awesome ! The new  classic  ones stink !

I RECEIVED MY ORDER IN ABOUT 1 WEEK AND IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THE GOJI JUICE I HAVE PURCHASED FROM GOJI GOLD OR AT FRUITFUL YIELD HEALTH FOOD STORES. THE GOJI JUICE I HAVE BOUGHT FROM GOJI GOLD OR AT FRUITFUL YIELD HEALTH FOOD STORES IS DELICIOUS AND I SEE IMPROVEMENTS IN MY SKINTONE IN 3 DAYS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HEALING NONI IS SELLING"
0;"""I have loved golden oreos since they first came out.  The fudge covered version was on sale at my local grocery so I decided to try them out.  They are not good at all. The  fudge  is ridiculously thick and you cannot taste the oreo itself.  I may try the mint version someday"
0;I received a birthday gift of these chocolates and was eager to dive in. Unfortunately they were a gloppy mess having melted during the shipping process by US MAIL. I don't know if they are good or not. What a disappointment. Shouldn't perishables be shipped another way? I won't order these chocolates again till maybe November.
0;"""Was shopping for some crackers to use as snacks with my diet.  Saw the  Saturated Fat Free  rather than the  fat free  printing on the front of the box.  Checked the ingredients.  This contains Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil.  Makes me not trust Ry-Krisp."""
0;"""The quality of the kit over buying the contents separately is not great.<br />The seasoning is the biggest sticking point. It's not the same as the normal individually store bought seasonings.<br />It's lighter in color and pretty much tasteless. The cheese sauce is adequate"
0;this is a joke !  the plant is in a 4 inch pot but it is barely 2 inches high with 4 small leaves.  i bought one a couple of years ago and it was fine but this is sad.  bay grows slowly so i'll be long gone before i can harvest a leaf from this plant.<br /><br />4-20 addendum -  i just received a bay from hirts - go to them if you want a bay plant.  it has lots of leaves and is 8 inches above the soil.  very healthy looking
0;i bought this for my son so it would be convenient when we went somewhere. The milk is not the same as the regular allementum. different texture and lighter. my son threw it up. and i wasted 80 dollars
0;"""This is the McDonald's of cat food. It's loaded with absolute crap that cats simply do not need and is designed to be highly appealing to customers who make purchasing decisions while minimizing costs to maximize profit. The top two ingredients are corn and corn meal"

0;My kitchen smell like a fire camp after opening the box and the smell still there for two days .<br />Its awful and have a funky taste to that .<br /><br />I cannot believe the only ingredient is salt ... taste really funky .<br />This will be the first Artisan Salt Co. product i have ordered and i burned bad with it .<br /><br />AVOID
0;"""THIS IS A REVIEW OF AMAZON'S SERVICE AND NOT THE QUALITY OF THE COFFEE:<br /><br />I originally purchased three bags of this product when it was on sale direct from Amazon. One out of those three bags was actually vacuum sealed and all had expiration dates within a month period. I guess the dates were the reason they were on sale but seriously"
0;"""I ordered 100% Columbian coffee and 100% arabica coffee arrived. according to the policy I have no recourse but to absorb the cost myself and to trash this Arabica CRAP coffee. There is not a refund for this Arabica coffee"
0;I should have paid more attention to the photos of this product when purchasing it.. I thought it looked like it was red-ish brown..but it is truly as red as Kool-aid and tastes completely unlike tea to me - it was most like unsweetened Kool-aid in my opinion.<br /><br />I'm an avid iced tea drinker - I drink it year 'round and a pitcher of tea is always at the ready in our fridge. I tried this tea to see if it would be a nice one to add to my rotation (I like Paradise Iced Tea and China Mist Mango & Passion Fruit ice teas). It was so horrible tasting I couldn't drink it. It doesn't taste like Mango at all - it tastes vaguely of herbal hibiscus and rose - it doesn't taste fruity at all.<br /><br />I plan to give it away to someone who likes herbal teas -- because I'm quite certain it lacks any black tea (or any tea at all?)..and therefore wouldn't be useful to me (I like caffeine in my tea).
0;"""Has a chemical flavor to it and it literally smells like vomit to me.  No resemblance of any con queso I've ever had!<br /><br />I love con queso salsa and have tried several variates.  Tostido's brand is pretty good"
0;Most of my family of eight managed to eat this cold the other night with chips.  We thought it tasted weird--kind of like it has green olive juice in it.<br /><br />Tonight my family was gone and I decided to heat some in the microwave.  It had just finished heating when the family returned.  They walked in the house and covered their noses.  One said it smelled like a terrible poopy diaper.  Another said it smelled like vomit.  My nine-year-old thought I had somehow invented something new and utterly disgusting.<br /><br />Is it more like poop or vomit?  Buy a case and decide for yourself!
0;"""OMG....this has got to be THE most foul tasting slop I have ever tried. It tastes nothing like cheese and queso dip but more like yellow/orange food coloring and thick motor oil. I can not possibly even conceive it that anyone at the factory tasting lab spooned this slop in their mouth and exclaimed its goodness and said  Let's go with it .<br />It's difficult to explain how bad this tastes"
0;I purchased this product at a local grocery store on sale and it was horrible. It literally tastes and smells like vomit. Don't waste good chips on this stuff you'd be better off eating chips plain than ruining your taste buds with this dip! I am a huge cheese eater and I could not stomach it...and that is saying a lot! How did this product pass inspection?
0;Returning it. Thought FL natural was made in the USA. Says made in China and these taste STALE. There is also a different language on the front and on the back maybe Arabic not sure but if i can only read half the box im not eating it.
0;"""I ordered these British candy jells not realizing they don't travel well in hot weather.  They arrived stuck together in one mass.  To taste them I had to cut out a chunk.  I live in Las Vegas with hot summers.  My advice"
0;I can't believe that I have to search for these on amazon. Like srsly double u tee eff kellogs? Why can't I buy them at the supermarket like a normal human being?

0;I have bought hundreds of items on amazon over the years but written very few reviews. I felt compelled to warn others with this cereal. I disregarded the other bad reviews thinking maybe they just had idiosyncratic reactions. My baby vomitted twice with this cereal two weeks apart. There needs to be an investigation with all these bad reviews.
0;cyanocobalamin aka the dirtiest form of vitamin B12 is in the product.<br />We wonder why cancer among kids is raising...we are not eating food anymore<br />but synthetic toxic crap.<br />Despicable! Bought it ounce will never buy it again!<br /><br />You better off with an organic egg/yellow preferably from a real farmer<br /><br />answer: methylcobalamin or even better hydroxocobalamin (that is the best of the best)<br /><br />Do not come and post a reply that tells me that cyanocobalamin is safe according to the FDA if you do not want to be flamed<br />do you research and stop repeating like a parrot what other idiots are telling you.
0;Thanks for the warning on the changes made by Nestles. One by one my favorite foods are being bought by foreign conglomerates. In the case of Nestles Switzerland restricts foreign ownership and to my mind there should be a quid pro quo and countries should ban Swiss companies buying up their companies. Rowntree was a successful company so it was not an issue of them struggling to survive.
0;"""I've mentioned this sauce in my review of <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZZM >Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce</a>. When shopping in the Strip District in Pittsburgh I picked up a couple bottles of this thinking it was something different. And it is in a bad way.<br /><br />The sauce has a runny consistency with a distinct taste of corn syrup. There is marginal chile and garlic taste and tasted either overcooked or old despite its freshness date. This is what Huy Fong aptly described as a  counterfeit : The packaging tries to look quite similar to the genuine Sriracha. It's as cut-rate as you can get. It's foul stuff.<br /><br />How can anyone mess up a hot sauce? Maybe that's why it has caution-yellow caps and ink: To warn you to keep away from this and buy the genuine"
0;"""I bought a tree from BonsaiBoy web site and Im dissapointed about my purchase. The actual tree is nothing like the one in the product picture on the web site. It is just a straight trunked tree about 2-3 years old potted in a bonsai pot. I could have bought a nicer looking tree from Home Depot and pruned it myself to make it look greater than this. This order costed me around $70 including shipping and the humidity tray. The tray doesnt match the pot (too larget for the pot)"

0;"""I have used Swanson's canned broths for over 40 years!! I've complained before about receiving Swanson's Natural Goodness beef and chicken broth from Amazon in damaged boxes and emptying & tossing all boxes in the shipment.  What I did not mention was the lingering and terribly unpleasant odor when emptying and washing the boxes.<br />Tonight I opened a can of chicken broth"
0;This item showed up timely and in one pc. The handles are attached at the base of the tin box and the workmanship was terrible. The first time I grabbed the handles one broke and I was unable to fix it. There is a small flap of metal that comes out of the base and a small hole in the handle that the flap goes through. If it's not done right you are out of luck. It's a matter of time til the other handle breaks.
0;"""I specifically ordered the Whiskas Dry Cat food in the original selection.  Recently the company has redone their kibble and my cats do not like it as well.

It tastes like nothing"
0;I am trying to understand how Amazon can charge 17 dollars for 8oz of grated cheese. Anyone who orders this needs their head examined or something. This is one of the worst screws I have seen on Amazon to date. Its about 5 in most stores and cheaper in others so you figure it out. Just PUCKERUP cause you are getting kissed. HAHA
0;"""I had high hopes for this product to be delicious.  The thought of having  fresh  pork rinds was intriguing until half of the rinds did not develop in the microwave.  Only about half of the product produced decent pork rinds"
0;I gave this as a Christmas gift. I was embarrased to see that the bags of nuts and dried fruit were so small when they opened it. They told me later on that they did not wish to complain about a gift but that they thought I should know. All the items were very stale and did not taste good. They wanted me to avoid ever purchasing this item again for anyone else. I was shocked and surprised because you received so little product for the price and then it is stale on top of it. Will never purchase anything from Broadway Basketeers again!!!
0;"""I purchased this item hoping to buy a large amount of artificial sweetner. The box arrived in a larger box of other item. When I opened the large box I found the powdered sweetner all over the other items.

0;This container of red vines was not fresh at all. Had to put them in the microwave for a few seconds to soften them up.<br />I have purchased this same container from Costco and Sam's club and have never had this problem.
0;Cheap Plastic Container will NOT Keep Product Fresh.  Stale after just 2 weeks.  Don't waste your money.  I also bought the Red version and had the same problem.  Amazon gave me a credit for the purchase.  What a great company to shop at.  :)
0;I must say I did look at the reviews before buying these but since it seemed like half 5 stars and half 1 star I would gamble.  It turns out the 1 stars were right.  These things shouldnt even have the name of licorice as they taste like they took a chemical bath right before packaging.  If I could give zero stars I would but I just had to warn people about these.
0;this stuff is horrible!! smells like wax and has some really fake chemical flavor or some kind of spice.. i would recommend that this gets gets used for lab rats only to see the effects of the main ingredient RED#40. unfortunately this is not a returnable item from Amazon so now the local dump has an additional 12lbs of garbage that will never decompose
0;I bought these because Amazon was running a sale and with the subscribe and save they were cheaper than the big pack of Twizzlers sold at Sam's Club.  These taste nothing like Twizzlers and leave an after taste in my mouth. Needless to say I cancelled my subscribe and save. Now what to do with 4 pounds of nasty tasting candy.
0;I usually don't leave reviews but I had to voice my opinion. Save your money !! Red Vines doesn't deserve to be called licorice. With a family of two children candy never gets thrown away in my house. Well Congratulations Red Vines !!! Your on top of the crap list !!!
0;"""This has to be the weirdest out-there tasting tea I have ever had. I love to experiment with teas and try all kinds but this is just disgusting. There is no real orange/tangerine flavor as the described by one reviewer. All you can taste is the fennel/anise and goji berries. I was hoping for a light and refreshing orange/bergamot tea and this is so far from it that no where on it's label should it  mention  orange. I will take it as money lost and stay far away from this one."""
0;It appears they don't care how long it takes to deliver.<br />I've been waiting a month so far.  Much more last time and then only after complaining.<br />They don't reply to emails.  And others say they don't pick up the phone or respond to phone messages.<br />I wonder what sort of an operation they're running.  Perhaps it's really just one elderly chemist with a hobby business and she only works one night a week.......<br />If you want to buy it try to get it from someone else.
0;i bought a jar of these so called yummy cherry lovers yummy they certainly werent my daughter came running to me to show me an actual piece of a glove inside the jar yuk disgusting and unprofessional never again will i or my family purchase any candy from this business AGAIN lucky i didnt sue them
0;"""It is too bad that the product is from Bolvia and it says **USDA Organic**. They did not test the product inside the package. First the packages are kind leaking powdery substance and second they stink and tast ROTTEN. I am not kidding DO NOT ORDER this PRODUCT"
0;My family has LOVED this cereal for years.  I recently read the packaging and have discovered that it contains artificial colors.  We are trying to avoid eating foods with artificial coloring in them.  Please reconsider Quaker?  We don't care what color it is!
0;"""I was so excited about this cereal when I tried it.  I bought it off Amazon here and when it arrived I dug in.  Well I had a headache and nausea episode quickly following.  I suppose I ate too much as the little sample I tried before did nothing to me.  It has to be the food dye as any other cereal didn't do that to me.  I used to be allergic to yellow #5 and #6 before (it would make me jump off the walls as a kid!).  I thought I outgrew it.  Maybe this is an  adult  allergy.  Quaker"
0;"""These are hard as rock and I have 10 Boxes which got expired. Waste of money !!!. I wish amazon did a better job in checking products which are sold by them.<br /><br />It defeats the whole purpose of buying grocery like non perishable items from a website instead of buying from a local grocery store.<br /><br />If amazon is to succeed in grocery business"
0;Was the manufacturing of this energy drink sabotaged. This stuff taste purely nasty. It's gets nastier with age.  And the nasty taste clings to your taste buds to make everything you drink taste nasty. Please improve the taste!!!!!!!!
0;Red Chile (not green) are in the sauce and the amount exceeds other spices by a wide margin - can not even taste the other namesake ingredients such as garlic and basil due to quantity of red chile - would not recommend.
0;I have purchased Godiva chocolates a few times and have always found them to be old and dried out.  I think the company has a problem with keeping stock fresh.  I have never had this problem with other chocolate brands.  For as much as Godiva charges for a premium product at least the product could be fresh and tasty instead of dry and tasteless.
0;"""Someone was kind enough to buy me these chocolates from my giftlist.  I've had Godiva chocolates delivered from Godiva's own site but thought it would be easier to list them on Amazon.  BIG MISTAKE!  When ordered from Godiva the chocolates were shipped fresh and cold with an ice pack to make sure they didn't melt.  The chocolates from Amazon where shipped in a regular box"
0;This is imported of China. Due to ongoing quality control and safety issue I would not recommend them whatsoever. Its nice to save a few bucks but not at my dogs expense. Would you eat chicken jerky from China? Google that if you said Yes. Returning due to non disclosure prior to ordering.
0;"""I love the Prima Taste Rendang curry so bought several of their products to try.<br /><br />This one looked promising! I bought the 12 pack on a leap of faith. It was a bad leap!<br /><br />As this cooked"
0;"""We bought this for my mother-in-law who lives 9 hrs away from us and had it sent directly to her. Bad idea to trust AMAZON. She seemed as though she was happy about it but about two weeks later I asked her how she liked the flowers and she had no idea what i was talking about. Apparently"
0;"""This blend is not worth $6 per pound!<br />This is my first experience with this roaster and it wasn't a good one. I bought the 5lbs and now I am looking to offload it onto someone.  I just can't afford to do so. It is on par with grocery store brands"
0;I like Walden Farms dressings so I was so excited to taste this mayo.<br />Oh My God!!!!!!!!! What's this!? I am soooooooooo disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />The texture is like mushed tofu and the taste is not mayo at all.<br />Just salty and weird.
0;"""KEEP YOUR RECEIPT. The product is NASTY...The product is guaranteed...but the process to get a refund is onerous (in my opinion).<br /><br /> I am sorry that you were not satisfied with our Mayo.  Please send a proof of purchase"
0;Product was NOT what I ordered and after paying for two boxes I only received ONE BOX.  I am totally unhappy and considering never to use Amazon again.  This is my second reveiw.  My first reveiw was NEVER respopnded to.
0;"""I switched my dogs from chicken soup for the pet lovers soul to blue buffalo and immediately my dogs and my cat started shedding so bad that I had furballs rolling around my house like tumbleweed! I kept them on it to see if it was just an initial reaction to the food change only to find that they started itching like they had fleas and had so much dander they looked like they had rolled in powder. I then read the ingredient panel to find the second ingredient in blue is chicken meal... Chicken meal could be anything! So after much reading of ingredient panels the one food I have always known to be five star was Merrick and they love their wet food so I switched them to Grammys pot pie dry food and viola! Instant change! In less than three days my dogs dander has gone away"
0;my dogs were on this brand of food for 3 years before I realized that the food was making them vomit at least 3 times a week! This after numerous vet visits and countless tests. Avoid this brand completely!!!!
0;"""I was a Blue Buffalo advocate from day one when I purchased it for my dog.  The ingredients were fantastic for a pet-parent who's dog is allergic to anything with corn or chicken (which is hard to find).  I'm a trainer at Petsmart and told all of my clients about this product.  This was before I had to deal with their customer service department.  On my way home from work one night I realized I needed to stop and get a bag so I swung by a Complete Petmart and picked up a bag.  I got home and realized it had been expired for almost a year.  On the bag it said they guarantee their product 100% and this guarantee means they will tell you to take it back to the store and exchange it and that it was your fault that you didn't look at the expiration date.  Why did I have to do the leg work for someone who is paid to check the dates?  In my Petsmart"
0;"""Purchased two boxes of these coffee pods and have used 10 of the 48.  The pods do not work correctly in my Keurig.  The machine sounds and acts differently with these pods and produces one half of the normal coffee size.  When reusing the pod the second time"
0;Emeril's coffees have a burnt flavor.  It is good strong coffee and would have been very good but the burnt flavor ruins any enjoyment.  The bold roast gives it the burnt flavor.  Don't confuse bold roast with strong coffee.  My husband loves very strong coffee and even he could not drink this.  Disappointed.
0;"""i bought this product because the reviews said it was a great tasting decaf. when the box arrived it said  decaffeinated using methylene chloride <br />i looked this up. this is a dangerous chemical and a known carcinigen. amazon will not accept the unopened box as a return because it is a grocery. i have lost the money<br />correction - amazon is refunding my money."""
0;"""I ordered this coffee based upon Emeril's reputation in the food industry and the fact that it's called  Jazzed Up .  I generally buy Starbucks or other premium coffees but Starbucks isn't out in a k-cup yet.  I am still in shock about how bad this Emeril decaf is.  I can't even say it's like poor quality grocery store level - it's seriously revolting.  I tried another one just to make sure I didn't get a 'bad' k-cup"
0;The soup was a good price compared to grocery stores but half the cans were seriously bent in the middle.  It appeared that Amazon was shipping what the big buyers were rejecting.  I bought 48 cans of soup shipped in three different shipments so there was no reason cans on the inside should be bent in the middle.  I was very disappointed but had been warned by previous feedback.  Won't buy again.
0;switched to this product and have not been happy with the results. Product seperates with a white cloud forming on the bottom of the bottle which looks horrible and the taste of this product is not as good as some of the cheaper brands. Color of the product is never the same either and has a tendency to turn dark
0;"""A lover of Celsius for many years...this is by far the worst product I have ever tasted. It is like bitter medicinal apple juice...I would give it zero stars if possible. Bought a 12 pack...threw out an 11 1/2 pack. Seriously...not sure if the formula is off or the Stevia isn't integrated properly"
0;"""First let me say I REALLY like the Orange and Kiwi flavors of Celsius.  They had the Apple at my local store so I grabbed several cans at a good price.  They are horrible.  It tastes like a combination of Apple Juice and raw sewage"
0;"""I agree with the others who mentioned this is the worse tasting of all the Celsius drinks.  The price was so cheap so I decided to purchase.  I almost threw up on the first try and couldn't even drink the rest.  Its smell wasn't even appetizing.  But if you decide to keep it and drink it"
0;I ordered three.  One was broken upon opening.  The other two broke within 20 minutes.  What a waste of money.  Then I found out that my daughter bought a similar item in Target for one dollar.<br />This experience would make me hesitate to order from an unknown company in the future.
0;This coffee is pretty much nasty. A very light roast that has little taste other than acid. The only way we've been able to drink it is by making a blend with a much darker roast. Definitely one of the worst whole bean coffees I've ever purchased.
0;"""I am so sad about this food. I have fed my animals evo and innova after P&G took over and ruined Iams and Eukanuba. I searched for a good food and I found the best food in the Nutura pet food. Organic USA based"
0;I purchase these all the time at the pet store but didn't realize there was diffence when it indicates Buffalo.  They smell so bad it was unbelievable.  I had to put them outside on my deck and you could smell them everytime you went out there.  I ran into a rep for Merrick at the opening of a pet store in my area and I told her how they smelled.  She said they went with a different vendor outside the US and they are cheaper and were buffalo. It did not sound like they were going to continue with the buffalo line but not sure.
0;I have wanted to post notices on the shelves of the grocery stores that stock Silk with their organic products.  Silk is no longer made with organic soybeans.  I think most people just grab it up without realizing that this product has changed.  And the price is high to begin with.  There are many other organic soymilks available that are cheaper and better quality than this rip off. I feel like they deliberately set out to deceive the consumer.
0;"""I can't believe this coffee has a 5 star rating and people give it positive reviews. The flavor is repulsive and makes me feel sick to my stomach. I am not blaming the roaster or Amazon. It's the coffee itself. I love good quality Columbian"
0;This peaberry is terrible.  They roasted it incorrectly I guess... a sour taste takes over in espresso or coffee..  Mad that I can't return it!!!!  If there was a negative RED star I would choose five of those...
0;"""Sorry Keebler ... not good!  They were like a little  underdone  chocolate chip cookies.  I gave 2 of the packages to family ... no one liked them ... not even my hubby.  I bought them because they were Keebler ... I will not buy these again."""
0;This is the item I remember from 60's. However I do not remember the retailer marking over the old price with a magic marker and charging a price close to double what it was originally.  This was kinda disappointing for a product coming from Amazon warehouse and will definitely preclude me from ordering again.
0;"""When I look for a hot sauce I want something that adds heat.  Plain and simple.  It should not have an overpowering flavor of it's own but simply a pleasant background upon which to serve up the heat.  I use hot sauce to accent the flavors of the food I'm eating with heat.  Amongst the hot sauces on the market any sauce that claims to be XXXX Habanero Hot should provide heat.  This sauce does not do that.  I usually use small drops of hot sauce on my foods.  With this sauce I was able to literally eat it by the tablespoon without a true heat sensation.  I gave it to my 18month old son and he didn't even raise an eyebrow.  No"
0;"""I ordered a bunch of different products in this line to make a comparison between them.<br /><br />I think I was exposed to too much of whatever is now making me itch and break out all over. It started with my arms after washing and conditioning my daughter's hair in the sink (I had already washed and conditioned my own hair with different products from the line)...I noticed red spots along my arms"
0;This is my first 1 star review.....I can't believe I'm writing it.<br /><br />I wanted to like this bar.  But I couldn't. The texture of the bar is repulsive and there's very little real flavor.  The idea of an organic strawberry bar really appealed to me.  Until I took a big ol' bite of this bar...can you say gag reflex?<br /><br />Organic foods can taste good....this one doesn't. Pass on the ProBar Fruition.
0;"""I was extremely disappointed on receipt of this item.  It came very poorly packaged and therefore arrived in a very unappealing way.  All of the nice decorations had fallen off and were crumbled.  The whole idea of the cake"
0;MSG- If you like cooking with MSG this rub is for you. I'm not an anti-MSG crusader but I was shocked to see it on the ingredient list of a high-end BBQ rub. Because it's such a small item it wasn't worth returning for a refund so I put it in the swap shop at my dump. Took a small taste before I did that - it was a little sweeter than I like a dry rub. I prefer to add sweetness with sauce.
0;"""DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE ANY ALLERGIES TO FOOD PRODUCTS.  THE NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION IS NOT FULLY DISCLOSED.  WHAT IS MISSING IS THE TAG LINE THAT ALL BOB'S MILL PRODUCTS ARE MADE IN A FACILITY THAT ALSO PROCESSES TREE NUTS AND SOY.<br /><br />BE AWARE"
0;"""Original 1 STAR Rating Chocolate Chip Cookies:<br />...12/16/2010 Splendid bubble wrapping AND a pristine box condition deceivingly held 4 packages of crumbles.

I'm not sure how prospective customers can be informed items are near their expiration date or the condition is sub par"
0;"""How dissappointing. I have fond memories of the Taffy cookies from my late grandmother and her always full cookie jars.  Imagine my dissappointment when I discovered these  New  Taffy cookies are not the same.  They have too much coconut in the recipe.  The old Taffy cookies were darker brown in color and had a completely different flavor.  I wouldn't say these new cookies are terrible"
0;"""Clearly I need to brush up on my math skills. I ordered the Riceworks brown rice crisps assuming the $17.95 price was reflective of a bulk purchase - because who in their right mind would pay $17.95 for ONE BAG OF CHIPS. But - sadly - no"
0;"""I just brought this home and gave it to my dog(cattle dog mix) and she literally had it out in 2 minutes flat. This is supposed to provide hours of interactive chewing challenge(as it states on packaging) but it didn't even give 5 minutes! I guess if your dog is a master chewed like mine"
0;The treat popped in less than 10 minutes.<br /><br />It took 1.5 hours before I was pulling bits of plastic out of my dogs mouth. Really REALLY expensive for such a short play time. I just went back to using his Kong.
0;"""Lasted maybe 5 minutes before my 10 pound poodle puppy popped the cap off and tried to swallow the thing whole.  I put the cap back in and let it  dry  as someone on here suggested for a tigher seal.  But that did no good and in like 30 seconds he managed to pop it out again.  What a waste"
0;I bought this for my dog and he destroyed it in less that 5  minutes.  I just kept seeing orange plastic everywhere.  He had destroyed the whole thing treat and all.  When I called about it they said well did you have a treat in it?  It just came out of your stupid package with one in it so uhhh yes.  Wost toy ever
0;"""I have a 2 year old small rottweiler mix. When i bought this toy she was just shy of 1 1/2  and was chewing through everything so after chewing through our third red kong in the matter of a month I was getting desperate and decided to try the everlasting treat ball. I bought the large size to slow her down. In five min she plucked out the treat and devoured it. Since the toy itself must of still had the smell of the treat she proceeded to rip the ball itself apart. In the 20 min I left her alone with this toy it was in about 30 little pieces"
0;Our Maltese puppy loves treat balls so I thought this would be a good gift for her. Within half an hour she managed to pry the disk from the ball and ate the treat. I liked the concept of the treat toy but it didn't work for us. Was afraid to give it to her again because she swallows greenies and treats  whole. Was afraid she would choke.
0;I have Great Dane/ Boxer Mix. It took him 1 min to take the treat out of the ball and another 15 to eat it... if that's what they call everlasting ...<br />If your dog is chewer this toy won't last at all.
0;The everlasting treat ball lasted about 5 minutes for my Scottish terrier mix.  Luckily the store is willing to take a return as it cost $18.99 for something that didn't last as long as a $1 pig ear.  If your dog is at all a powerful chewer don't but this toy as it won't last.
0;"""The Everlasting Treat Ball is a great concept but poorly executed. The Everlasting Treat end caps come off very easily with a minimum amount of slobber. My puppy would lick them (because I'm sure they taste great) and within 5 minutes"
0;"""I was going out of town for X-Mas and thought these would keep my boys a bit entertained while I was gone.  I have two smallish (15 pound) Boston Terriers and they each completely destroyed one of these in about five minutes.<br />The ball works OK for a fetch toy"
0;"""We have a Great Dane puppy - just shy of 9 months -<br /><br />I have been looking for things to keep her occupied and busy.<br />I read in some forums for Great Danes that people had liked this treat/toy.<br />The dog LOVES the treats"
0;"""I have a year old lab that is not destructive and not an aggressive chewer. This seemed like a great idea since she is ball crazy and loves treats. In under 10 minutes she had both treats gone and the ball in pieces. We have had cheap old rubber toys last much longer. Don't buy this $20 toy"
0;"""Took my dog less 8 minutes to remove the treat from the  virtually  indestructible  ball that provides  hours of stimulation  and consume it. It was so hard to believe I put a second treat in the ball and the dog  removed and consumed it in even less time.<br />A total waste of money"
0;I have two Great Danes who love chew-treat toys. Especially KONG. I brought the Everlasting Treat Balls Home and they both were able to pop out the treat within 2 minutes! They enjoyed the treats- but the expensive plastic ball is useless. I will be returning this product tomorrow!
0;"""This toy billed to keep dogs entertained for hours lasted my dog 20 min.<br /><br />Be very careful with this toy. My boy ended up swallowing a big piece which made him sick and resulted in a very expensive trip to the vet. Fortunately it did not cause a blockage"
0;My 1 yr old Pomeranian loved licking and nibbling on the treat on the ball. He had a blast with it until it started coming apart. It seems that in less than an hour my dog had destroyed it. He chewed the rubber trying to get to the treat. I threw away the ball so he wouldn't accidentally eat it. It was a good idea but needs to be stronger like the Kong.
0;"""I gave the ball with the treat stuck inside to my dog yesterday. He would not go anywhere near it. He sniffed the toy and treat and then walked away and it hasn't been touched since. I think what's turning him off is the smell of the plastic ball itself. It has a VERY strong fake-vanilla scent to it which is unpleasant to humans but must be overwhelmingly gross to a dog. By the way"
0;If you have an aggressive chewer DO NOT BUY THIS.  My 18 month old pit mix was able to pop the end out within minutes.  I put it back in and gave it to him.  within 5 minutes the rug had bits of blue plastic as the holder is very easily chewed.<br /><br />Such a waste of money as that toy is a bit pricey.
0;"""I got this for my 22 lb shih tzu who is pretty good at figuring things out. He is totally disinterested in this toy (which I bought at retail for $20). He doesn't find the treat at all appealing and because the flaps seem rather stiff"
0;A friend got the Everlasting Treat ball and 2 extra refills for my 17lb. dog.  My dog is not a destructive chewer but he had chunks of the blue part torn out within 20 min. It makes me mad when I think of how much it and the replacement treats cost and now it is trash.  That is why I am writing this review.
0;I  have  bought  many  cases of  this  before i  dcided  to  check  on the  internet  for it...My  son is in  Iraq and  he  loves  the  cold  brew  to  put in  his  water  along  with a little  sweetener and  he  get  the  delicious  taste  of  brewed  tea...I  also  asked  lipton  to  donate a  case  to me  so i  could  send it to  my  son and  of  course  they  could not ...I  will  continue  to  buy  it  for  him  though  it is  one  enjoyment  he  gets  over  there...<br />  I  myself  started  using it  when i  worked  in the  factory 3rd  shift and  wanted  the glas  of  tea  without having a place to  keep it  by  the  jug  ...<br />Thank  you  Lipton  is  is  the  best

0;I purchased this based on an episode of the Dr OZ show and to mix it with the carbonated water that I make using the SodaStream Carbonator.  It does not mix well and the taste is not to my liking.  There are no directions on the package so I have used various amounts to no avail.
0;"""So I get my case after feeling sucked into buying after reading two 5-star reviews and the things are on sale.  Ok...BLAND.  I could deal with the blandness because I liked the few and simple ingredients.<br /><br />Then I read the back while I'm crunching...5 SERVINGS in this little 2 OZ bag and says 6 pieces a serving.  (This page lists it as 7 pieces..)  Huh??  I just finished an entire bag in about 3 minutes because the small bag had only 12 tiny pieces and was so light I thought the entire thing was one serving.  You are led to believe that after reading  Nutrition  on this page.  How do you get 5 servings out of that?  That's like calling 2 M&M's a serving.<br /><br />Each serving has 13 GRAMS of FAT.  Times that by 5! Then times the carbs by 5..holy cow.  This little 2 oz gem has more fat than if I'd just dug into a bag of chips and the chips would have had much more flavor and been 5 times more pleasurable to eat.  Amazon also says high in potassium and I see no listing of that on the bag at all.<br /><br />All in all I'll not be buying again.  HUGE amount of fat and carbs if you believe the confusing garb on the bag"
0;These pop rocks are XXXXtremely sour.  I gave them for trick or treat candy. They are so sour we could not get any children to eat the whole pack.  They threw their extra packs away. I still have half the container left and none of my children nor the neighborhood children want to eat them.
0;I can go into any store that sells candy and find everything that they have in the 90s crate and it would cost MAYBE $10 and get a nice REUSABLE basket to put it in from the thrift shop. They don't even have Crybabies or Warheads or Bubble Tape!!!!! RIP OFF!!!!!!!!
0;I was very unhappy.I have bought stuff from them befor and was quite pleased. But..... When I received this item I was furious. There was not even close to $26 worth of candy for one.And it was just candy did not seem to be from the 90's. Just not happy at all.
0;"""Thought I would try Starbucks coffee because I never had it before and wanted to see what all the  talk  was about with Starbucks. I just simply did not like it. It was WAY to strong and a little bitter for my taste. I made the mistake of having this right before bed"

0;This product is terrible.<br /><br />I use different types of bread mix in an automatic machine.  This bread did not rise at all.  I used 3 different packages out of the 6 and all were bad.  Basically<br />the bread did not rise.  I switched to another brand and the loaf came out fine.  Be warned...  not a great product.  Basically cooked a loaf that looked like a<br />softball.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!
0;"""I bought the mum-mums for two reasons: to provide teething itch relief for my 6-month-old son and to keep him independently occupied with something to munch on. The mum-mums disappointed on both of these counts. They are way too fragile and crumble easily. I thought they would be hard so that he could suck on them for a while"

0;I bought this muffin mix and followed the directions exactly.  These muffins were far more dry than anything I've ever experienced in one of the Marie Callender Restaurants.  There are much better muffin mixes out there than this one.  Buy one of those others please...
0;This product is grown and packaged in China.  Many of China's apple products have been known to contain<br />unacceptable levels of arsenic and lead.  Do not support a government that poisons people and denies basic human rights.
0;"""I've had several of the brothers all natural products and purchased several cases after reading that they are a company in western ny. I liked supporting what I assumed was a small business operating in a big apple growing area of the country. It turns out that they just repackage a product that comes to them from china. I emailed the company and they tried to assure me that they are positive their chinese product is of the highest quality and the reason for the apples coming from china when there are apple orchards in their backyard (I've driven by the plant and apples grow all over around there) is because there are no freeze drying facilities in the us. This doesn't make any sense because I checked a package of mountain house freeze dried apples and they are made in the us from us produce.<br /><br />If buying chinese produce doesn't bother you then these are for you"
0;Don't know what else to say.  I haven't met a dog that will take one of these... and I still have a whole bag left.  Should have known by the unnatural color and smell that there is nothing natural about these.  I still don't know what to do with this huge bag.
0;I believe they wanted this cookie to taste like a brownie. I am so used to Chips Ahoy having that subtle choco flavor with a crisp bite that this cookie surprised me. It is gooey as stated on the package but the texture is awful. Enough for me and my daughter not to finish our cookies. We love cookies so you know that this was not a good one if we did not finish it! The taste is not a brownie taste. Can't even explain it. I am sure they are trying to branch out with more choices but how did this one pass their focus groups??
0;My favorite cookie is a chocolate chocolate chip cookie from Otis Spunkmeyer.  So when these cookies came up for review I was EXCITED!!!  When I got them I opened them right away and took a bite.  I nearly spit it out in a napkin.  It was that bad.  The cookie itself was dry.  The chocolate flavor was off.  The chips in the cookie were crumbley and the middle of the cookie wasn't gooey at all.  It looked and tasted more like frosting that was a couple of days old.  The packaging states these cookies are crammed with real chocolate chips and creamy fudge.  To get the cookie I got after reading a description like that is nothing but a disappointment.  These will not a something that makes it on my shopping list.... ever.
0;"""I have ordered this licorice from another seller several times.  It comes in sweet and fresh and the perfect consistency.  I mistakenly ordered this and was quite miffed when I received it.  It was hard and actually hurt to chew it.  So while the brand itself is the best I have ever found this product is terrible.  I suggest looking for the three pack that comes in plastic rather than this product that comes in a box.  If I had ordered this product first"
0;"""The product description claims  It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors.  This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose)"
0;I'm very dissappointed that the regular flavors of these soda syrups contain artificial sweeteners.  Not all of the regular flavors are available in the Natural flavors so you tend to miss out on many of the varieties. Too bad.  I might have to look into making my own syrups.
0;This product arrived and I found it a little odd that a liquid food product such as this is not encased in a cellophane shrink wrapping.  Then I opened the top and found that there was not even a seal across the top of the bottle.  I promptly threw the stuff out!
0;"""I should have read the product description better. The artificial sweetner in the Lemon Lime mix creates a drink along the lines of Diet Sprite (or other lemon limey diet drinks). If you like diet lemon lime"
0;"""The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid"
0;The energy drink that they sent had a different color label. It did not taste as good as the one I ordered and it gave me digestive problems. I don't recommend their changed energy drink formula. The original tasted great & is the reason I bought the machine.
0;"""I actually bought these white noodles along with the brown shirataki noodles to try out and I threw these noodles out along with the other bags. I couldn't help gag from the stench of these noodles. You can rinse them"
0;"""I have been buying this product for well over two years and had been delighted by it!  Gluten-free mixes for the most part are horrible and this used to be exceptional not only in taste but in texture.<br /><br />To my great surprise and disappointment the ingredients have been reformulated. I recently reordered two cases of this mix"
0;The description says 96 packs of 2 bars when it is actually 12 packs of 2 bars you are receiving.  I know the pic says 12 pack but it could have been a 12 pack of 8 packages of 2 bars.  8x12=96.  Seems like the seller is trying to be tricky to get more sales.

0;"""This product is a disappointment. There was more of a candy coating than sunflower seed and the candy was not tasty at all. It had a stale and smoky quality to it that I did not expect and I could not find one person that tried them who liked the taste at all. The best part of these"
0;These were very pretty but contained more candy than sunflower seeds.  The seeds were so small they were not tasted.  There are better products out there that contain larger sunflower seeds that can actually be tasted in addition to the candy coating.
0;"""This product was shipped from Amazon with the expiration only two months out. I contacted Organic Valley directly and was told that they ship the milk with a six month expiration date. That means it sat in Amazon's warehouse for four months"
0;"""I love coconut oil and thought I would try Swanson's since I was placing an order for other items and needed some more oil. I was very  disappointed. There is a nasty chemical taste to it.

Made from American Grown Fruits  but on the back in small letters is... Made in China . I feel this is very deceptive on the part of this company. I wish we could return these"
0;The disturbing thing is that they are made in China.  Nowhere on the product description does it state that fact.  Florida's Natural - you would just assume they were made in Florida or someplace close.  I tossed the whole box out because I will not let my family ingest anything made in China.  I do not trust their production values.

0;This is the third time I ordered cheese from this company. It came extremely fast when ordered thru Amazon however you'll receive a 10% off discount card and be urged to order direct from the company in your box. When you do however it will take much longer to receive that shipment.<br />The cheese that I received today and used in my recipe tasted like nothing...powder. It's tasteless almost like they forgot to add something.<br />I'll be throwing the remainder of the cheese away. It'll be a crapshoot whether you'll get something like I got this time or maybe if you're lucky you'll get a good one. I wouldn't waste another dime with them.
0;"""This is not the same product as the Brach's product found in retail stores.  These have a different coating with a peanut inside.  It seems that this is  Brachs Maple Nut Goodies  and the real candy is  Brach's Maple Nut Goodies .  Kind of deceiving isn't it?  A total rip-off!"""
0;The seller's description for this item didn't include the size of the 24 boxes which turned out to be .78 ounces.  There are about 10 candies in each box and the retail price shown on each box is 25 cents.  That means I spent almost $15 for a case that retailed at $6.  Not a good value.
0;The description didn't include the size of the boxes. The smallest boxes by other sellers was 2.2 oz. This was a 'case' of 24 boxes and each box was 0.78 oz. It also described the shipping weight as 3lb which was what I assumed to be about right. Don't buy this.
0;I once used Thai Kitchen Brand Red Curry as a substitute for Patak's and I basically ended up with 4 lbs of bland and over-salty shrimp.  I highly recommend Patak's Curry Paste.  Patak's is the best red curry paste I have ever used.<br /><br />I have cooked red curry chicken and red curry shrimp and Patak's made my entrees delicious.  I simmered the paste with meat and vegetables and then added some lite coconut milk to create a rich and flavorful curry sauce.  Yum!<br /><br />A word of advice.. Don't waste your money on Thai Kitchen brand.<br /><br />Feel free to send me a message if you want to talk about Thai and Indian recipes.<br /><br />Greg
0;One jar of Thai Kitchen Red Curry Paste used to last me for years.  It was so powerful that a half-teaspoon could season a quart of curry.  Finally ran out of the old stuff (purchased c. 2005) and bought a new bottle.  I added the usual amount and tasted the curry.  Nothing!  Added a tablespoon--then two.  STILL nothing.  Finally I tried some right out of the jar.  The only flavor in it was salt!  Message to serious heat-seekers: Don't waste your money on this garbage.  It has the kick of a ninety-year-old mule.
0;"""I don't quite understand why this tea contains 'natural peach flavor' rather than simply 'peach'.  It doesn't seem like actual peach would be too much to ask.  The 'natural flavor' gives the tea an off taste"
0;What a big mistake this was buying these.  They are the size of a quarter each!! Very bland and disappointing. I have had these type of cookies before. I would expect to pay less then a dollar for the whole package at a store. Don't waist your money!
0;gummy-bitter chocolate and mostly melted by arrival time. Not good enough for this florentine gourmet cookie lover  to serve. needed to cool before we could peel off the plastic trays. They are thin withut the nut taste that makes a good florentine.

0;I've seen these at my local Petco where I looked over the ingredient list.  Soy or Soy protein is either the first or second ingredient.  Soy is something I avoid in anything I give my cat.  Soy isn't very digestible by cats and is often a common food allergen.  Also soy is also considered bad for your cat's thyroid gland.  In addition soy may also impact the amount of Taurine your cat absorbs

0;I honestly don't know how this item is allowed on store shelves! It's THAT BAD!<br /><br />I was having trouble locating my favorite vanilla nut tea from another tea company and in its absence decided to try Stash's. I cannot even express how 'chemical' and unnatural it smelled and tasted! I had to throw it out! Will never purchase Stash again.<br /><br />Disregard the 1 star rating... I would give it 'zero' if I could!
0;"""Yuck! This has to be one of the worst tasting teas ever. I actually really like the other Stash Tea flavors so I'm surprised this one tastes pretty disgusting. It tastes like benadryl or something. It definitely doesn't taste like vanilla or chai. I don't know why it even tastes the way it tastes. I even sweetened my tea with molasses to sweeten it"
0;"""I sent this one back!!!  First the color is not as shown.  The pudding is a  gray  color (how appetizing is that!) not the vanilla color as shown.  Second the taste is horrible!  Not a hint of vanilla"
0;This is the new First Colony coffee as produced by White Coffee Company. It tastes the same as their own brand of Viennese with Cinnamon. Dark roast with just a hint of cinnamon. Itis NOT at all the same as the coffee produced by First Colony when it was an independent company.
0;I received the offer from Amazon and had never tried this brand before.  I thought since Martinson's had been in business for a long time that I would order.  I was disappointed.  The flavor was not what I expected and each cup of coffee had a residue in it. I have not had any of the other brands do that so I know it had to be the coffee.  I am guessing that the coffee was ground to fine for a K-Cup.  I only have 8 more left and will be glad.  I will not buy this brand again.
0;Tried the new coffee by Martinsons because I needed something new. Every cup I tried seems to have a lot of coffee dust and sludge on the bottom the cup. I know that some of these k-cups do that but it seemed much more than usual. I think the filter is not filtering the coffee properly and allowing the finer grounds to get through.

0;"""This is delicious and nutritious soup which we ordered after ordering and being pleased with the Tomato soup.  BUT 9 of the 12 cans arrived badly dented!  I submitted a review on packaging with a photo of the 9 cans"
0;All of the cans in this case are dented in different places. It is obvious to me that dented cans were hand-picked for packaging.  The fault does NOT lie with FedEx or UPS because of the location of the dents.  Someone just took the damaged soups off the shelf and packed them up for sale.  Food items cannot be returned or refunded.  This is a battle with Amazon that will continue until I receive a refund.
0;"""The cans I received were severely bent. This did not happen in shipping. The box was in good condition and packaged well. Amazon needs to indicate the condition of the canned good they are selling (or at least mention the possibility of the cans being bent"
0;"""Could not believe how small these baskets were...we were so deflated when we saw what they looked like & for what we paid for them...!  I would absolutely NEVER order from here again.  To give you some idea"
0;I was trying to keep up with my little one so I tried numerous things before ordering the tea.  I tried pumping more and drinking more water.  I tried the fenugreek supplements too before my obgyn suggested this tea.  It was a waste of money.  It didn't work at all and my baby suffered.  She had horrible tummy aches and diarrhea.  I wish I had read the negative reviews first but I was so hopeful this would work.
0;"""A caveat to this review is that the tea is wonderful and really does help.  But I digress...<br /><br />I purchased this same product for roughly $6.  When I saw  pack of 6  in the product description"
0;"""I had my 1st baby in Dec 2010 and had alot of trouble produce milk.<br />so at the advise of just about everyone including a lactaction consultant I tried a similar product also containing fenugreek. I researched it online and one of the side effect was  intestinal distress  well it didn't cause any problems for me"
0;"""DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. This did not work and it was gross. I tried it for a week with no results.  I was very disappointed. I then started eating oatmeal (my Dr. recommended it) and it increased my supply a little. If you are going to try it"
0;"""I bought a 6 pack box since it looks exactly like the one my wife was buying at Whole Foods. but just slightly less expensive. Unfortunately it was the only similarity with the one from Whole Foods. It tastes differently and not as intensive"
0;After reading all of the great reviews I decided to try this...my baby is 7 weeks old and I am trying to stock up feedings in the freezer so I needed to produce more milk to do so. I tried the tea for 2 days and it actually DECREASED my milk supply so I stopped. So I read up on other ways to increase my milk supply...I read eating oatmeal helps and of course drinking lots of water. The oatmeal REALLY works!! I suggest eating oatmeal if nothing else is working for you.
0;This may work for some people but it absolutely tanked my milk supply (and it tastes awful to boot). Every time I would drink it the whole next day's feedings were terrible. After 4 days of this I called it quits with this tea and magically our feedings were fine again. This is one time I think correlation IS causation. Too bad too because I had finally found a way to get it down...drinking it with a werther's caramel in my mouth. Not healthy but it did the trick. I say give the tea a try to see if it works for you but if your feedings start going poorly this is probably the cause.
0;I sing in a band and wanted some comfort for my throat before a show. My girlfriend and I both became sick and couldn't finish this tea.<br />We have bought many other teas from the same company and have been happy with them. Just a warning on this one.
0;when buying this i was thinking i will get something that taste very similar to honey but instead it tasted like plastic  suger taste it doesnot work well on tea or coffee or anything u wanna get it sweeten
0;I thought I'd save about a buck and a half and buy this.  Yuck.  It doesn't even remotely resemble the flavor of honey.  The carbs in the product are virtually the same as in real honey and the calorie difference is only about 20%.  NOT worth it. No way. No how.
0;This is horrible! DO NOT BUY! This coffee tastes nothing like something from Maui nor has it sat even near to a vanilla bean or any kind of nut! You'd be better off buying foldger's or maxwell house. It was over roasted\scortched and ground way too fine. I cant believe anyone liked this at all! I have to believe the positive reviews are from friends and relatives. what a waste of my money.
0;"""I cannot eat this - it has glycerin in it.  All these good qualities it claims it has  - these are not any good when it has glycerin in it.  A little bad ruins the whole bag of what would have been good.<br /><br />And the bag claims to be  clusters .  It is really crumbly - I see no clusters.<br /><br />A waste.  I will try to find somebody who will want to eat this."""
0;As I write this my 17 lbs Bischon Poodle is in the vet hospital after liver shut down yesterday. Looking for the best food on the market for my dog I researched and read the rave reviews for Orijen all natural food. I decided to place my dog on it. She has been on it for a little over 3 months. She refused to eat the past couple of days. I took her to the vet. The high protein level in Orijen food had put my dog into liver shutdown. I fed her according to recommendations. Protein needed for a small dog is 10-13 % Orijen 39%. No where does Orijen put a warning on their food stating that it could be detrimental to small dogs. I would never recommend this product for a small dog. I would never use it for any dog of mine. The normal level of liver enzymes should have been 70-100. My dogs after being on Orijen for 3 months 750. The risks are too high think carefully and make sure you consult your vet. I would hate to see anyone go through what I've experienced with my dog.
0;"""I am a K9 police officer for a fairly large police department.  One of our local pet stores recently started selling Orijens dog food and told us of its high quality.  It was supposed to be ideal for large active dogs.  Six officers transitioned their K9s to this food.  Five of those six officers have had to take their dogs off of it.  Two dogs nearly died from gastric and liver problems.  These two had to spend days overnight at the vet"
0;this dog food is dangerous after being on it for 1 1/2 months all three of my dogs showed dangerous high levels for their livers. After being taken off for 2 1/2 weeks all went back to normal. This food can kill your dog be careful.
0;"""My SCAM alert went off like a claxon when I saw this.<br />'Whole Wheat' can mean one of two entirely different things.<br /><br />1) It can mean it is made from the entire wheat berry.<br />or<br />2) It is plain old white flour stripped of its nutrient germ and bran but the product is 100% wheat and does not include OTHER grains<br /><br />Read the ingredients on this and you will see  Duram Whole Wheat Semolina <br />Looking up Semolina"
0;I was very disappointed with this product after using the Everlasting Treat Ball inserts and really liking the Everlasting Ball.<br /><br />The initial problem was screwing the two ends onto the rod. I'm not sure if there is some special trick to this or what because I spent a longer time trying to figure out how to screw it all together than it took for my dog to chew through it.  The pieces don't seem to fit well together and the first time I tried to muscle the whole thing in place the end pieces cracked.<br /><br />One of my dogs who is admittedly a strong chewer was able to get through the  ends and rod in under 15 minutes.  She can pretty easily bite the rod down to the end cap and has figured out that if she licks the ends enough the two end pieces will easily pop out because they don't fit in as snuggly as the everlasting treat ends do for some reason.<br /><br />I would recommend skipping this and just using the Everlasting Treat Ball inserts if your dog is not a really aggressive chewer.
0;I ordered this product expecting it to to look like the picture shown.  When I received the antler it was about 4inches long and extremely thin (in width).  I have bought antlers for my puppy in the past who is an aggressive chewer and they have lasted for months.  This one is almost gone and it has only been a few days!  Definitely not worth the price and not as pictured!
0;"""Over the last several months I have been hearing about deer antlers and I've done a lot of research and read lots of reviews before I decide to try this product. I have three black labs that have a chew product every night to help keep their teeth clean and thought this might be a way to save money and give them something new to chew on. Although the cost was kind of expensive"
0;"""Why would a pet food that calls itself  organics  have NON organic  chicken meal  as the 2nd ingredient? I'm disappointed by this and most of the organic pet foods that include non-organic chicken meal"
0;"""I wish I could return this item.  The straws taste horrible.  They taste extremely old and nothing like what other sour punch products taste like.  They are overly sweet with a weird aftertaste.  Avoid this product if you want something that is fresh and tastes like sour punch.  I would suggest trying the ropes.  Yuck"
0;I recently opened a box of this cereal and it smelled like burnt plastic.  Very chemically smell.  I have read that others have had stale boxes that smell like rancid oil.  I took the cereal box back to the store but worried that it was tainted somehow.  I did not call Barbara's... probably should have.  :(
0;No wonder why this cereal is cheap. It does not smell very good or taste very good but I am sure it is healthy so I will eat it. I mix it with another cereal in order to add some taste. As soon as I opened the bag inside the box I knew it was not going to be a great tasting cereal due to the odd smell. Oh well you do not know until you try.
0;"""Words cannot describe the nasty aftertaste in my mouth right now after just having finished one of these cookies. I am currently wracking my brain thinking what I have in the house that might get rid of this taste (other than brushing my teeth). Ugh. Basically"

0;Papaya Seed Dressing is absolutely delicious but the price is outrageous! I bought a packet in Hawaii for $2.95 at an ABC store(known for tourist pricing) and could not resist buying it on Amazon. With a price of $6.93 and a shipping weight of 1lb. I though that the box would contain 2 or 3 packets of dressing mix. I was very surprised to open the box and find 1 packet. As a Prime member I didn't have to pay any additional shipping charges instead I only had to pay a $4 premium to get this dressing -- never again!
0;I ordered $40 worth of product.  When it arrived the chocolate was hot and completely melted.  It tasted bitter.  I immediately sent an e-mail to the seller.  They wrote me back requesting photographs.  I took photographs and sent them to the seller.  I have never received any response.  The final result is $40 spent and nothing to show for it as the chocolate was inedible being bitter and melted into the wrapped with a non-responsive seller.
0;This is junk. Taste like water. No comparison with others like Bonsai Espresso Blend Espresso from Veltons or even the one that sells in Whole Foods. Try  different grind size (smaller size it gets better) and similar results. It goes to the garbage.
0;Im pretty dissappointed with the Kaps. Ive tried to use them several times and every single time I get a very watery cup of coffee that I end up having to dump down the drain because it tastes so watered-down. Ive tried a few different brands of coffee and all the same. Maybe Im just using the wrong kind of coffee..but I thought the point was that you could use ANY kind that was your favorite. I have not yet found a brand that actually works in here. Its a great idea..but I was expecting a lot more. I feel like I wasted my money because the Kaps are now tucked away in a drawer and I continue to buy the expensive K-cups. Oh well..
0;The hole in the center of this Kap is just too large. Period. It spews grounds throughout the k-cup holding chamber and down into your coffee cup. Period. Every time.<br /><br />Huge waste of money. I cannot recommend.
0;"""I have a B31 mini Keurig and these would not work with it because the entrance needle is off-center and does not go through the hole on these kaps. The description should have said that they will not work in all models"
0;I have the mini Keurig. These do not work in that maker and they are such a hassle to get them on the K cup.  I bought some metal ones on amazon that just sit on the top of the K cup and they work like a charm and it takes 5 seconds to do it. I wasted $35 bucks on these plastic cumbersome ones.  Save your money or get the metal ones.
0;I would NOT buy from this company again. when the pro treats came they were already expired by over two months. costimer service was not help full and did NOT give me a refund or exchange the product for a new one.  custmer service was the worst I have ever experience. I even sent them the upc code and the copy of the sale receipt and I still did not get a refund or exchange of product.  I woud NEVER buy fromt them again. I recommend you dont either.
0;In February of 2010 I ordered a 14 oz canister of Pro-Treat Freeze dried chicken liver dog treats.I had been giving another brand of freeze dried chicken liver treats to both my dog and cat. They both loved these treats. When I opened my new Pro-Treats freeze dried liver treats I smelled an odd odor. My cat would not eat these new treats. My dog did eat these treats  but every morning he started throwing up. I stopped giving these treats to my dog and he stopped getting sick. The liver treats may or may not have been responsible for my dog getting sick but I didn't want to take a chance of my dog getting sink again.
0;"""I tried all of the different disposable products.  Waisted like 60 bucks on all of them.  Amazon was loving me.  They ALL leak.  I am back to regular manufacturer K-Cups or the My K-Cup (the one you can get in the store) (That's the only one that doesn't leak).<br /><br />I even went online and checked out the reviews that said to move the rubber seal down on the needle"
0;"""We just recevied our 35 count Crazy Cup Sampler(the best sampler we have found so far) and are in the process of taste testing vanilla flavored coffees in the hope or finding one we will enjoy drinking daily.

0;The worth herring that I ever tried. I bought 4 based on 1 review. Herring<br />is sour and failing apart.NOT EATABLE AND GOES TO TRASH!!! Cant return because company policy not taking perishable items.
0;I really liked this Hazelnut coffee when it was sold in canisters as I can take exact qty I want for my cup and it was more or less reasonably priced.<br />Now this one is exact opposite - I can NOT take exact qty I want for my cup and it is NOT reasonably priced.<br />So knowing that it can't compete with their previous (canister) version they just discontinued canisters.<br />DO NOT BUY IT - unless you want to encourage corporate greed and arrogance by Nescafe.<br />Tasters Choice is well on its way to join a list of brands destroyed by greed and stupidity.
0;"""I totally love this Hazlenut coffee and was shocked when I went to reorder the canister 3 pack and found it was no longer available.  These individual packs might be nice to have in my purse when I am out and about"
0;Go look at pictures of California Black Worms.... thats what these look like.  Wow - amazing that anyone would call this food!  Threw away the 5 pack along with the White worms too... total of $33 in the trash!  But my stomach and brain thanks me! Disgusting!  How can they sell this??
0;I bought several different varieties of the dr. johns products and my family of four sat to have a few in front of a movie.  The adults had 4 and 5 pieces each and each of the children had 3 pieces.  All but one member of the family had terrible intestinal issues throughout the next 12 hours+.  I called the company to return the product and they would not return opened product.  I am shocked that even though less than the recommended serving was consumed and we got so sick. Awful experience!!!
0;"""I do not believe that this is the same gum from years ago.  It has a terribly sweet synthetic overpowering smell.  I discovered that I am allergic to one or more of it's ingredients.  The flavor lasts about 60 seconds and then it's like chewing a big wad of rubber.  Since this is non-returnable"
0;I know I should have read the nutrition label first. I have been buying and really like the Uncle Sam with Berries and I jumped to the conclusion that this cereal was similar. It is LOADED with sugar and tastes lousy. Luckily the food shelf takes anything.
0;I don't understand why an ingredient list would not be included with these products.  What about people with allergies?  Is that where we are in this country?  we'll eat anything if it sounds tasty without knowing what's in it???
0;I bought this so I can pack single serve soy milk on my almost 2 day flight across the Atlantic for my toddler who is allergic to milk.<br />It worked well BUT I just noticed that it expires in less than 6 weeks from when I placed my order!!! I wished that that information was listed because I will not be able to finish it before it expires. What a waste!! :(
0;I sent this as a gift for someone away for a week for the holidays.  I paid EXTRA for it to arrive on Dec 26th. That's strange in itself. They sent it on the 23rd and it sat out for three days until the person arrived on the 26th! Then they could not ship a new one till the 30th when the person was coming home.  Terrible customer service. Beware as a gift!

0;Nothing like the picture. I was disappointed because proflowers did a good job last year. Next time I am not going to be confident to make a purchase just because you don't know how the local florists is going to make it. But this one look promising...but it turned out bad. It was embarrassing and a waste of money. They do offer a replacement for not cost. Let's see how it turns out then.
0;I can't have caffeine so I was looking for a product that would give me energy when I needed it without the headaches caffeine caused me.I was very dissapointed. It didn't give me any energy at all and I had to gag down the severly sweetened tasting product to find that out.

0;So not sure what gives with this but this ISN'T the same Mudslide I had in the variety pack..The normal mudslide smells/tastes so good and smells my kitchen up with the yummy chocolate coffee smell but not this.. As a hint of chocolate but that is about it- I would have returned but threw out the packaging...

0;I emailed the following to Ocean Spray:<br /><br />*Blueberry Juice Cocktail<br />The new Blueberry Juice Coctail does NOT taste like Blueberry at ALL!!<br />Your add & label are misleading.  This is more like cranberry juice with a splash of blueberry.  I don't like cranberry and I am extremely disappointed.<br />Your tv ad should have the guys in the cranberries with a few blueberries - that's realistic.
0;"""This was delivered while the weather was still quite temperate. We brought them in immediately and the package was not warm inside. I can't prove it but I find it hard to believe this was a 2012 product. The cardboard inserts in the packages were soaked with oil.

0;"""This product has made my dog SO sick! She hasn't stopped throwing up for the past hour and is clearly in pain after eating a Dentastix. I recently found out about how bad of a brand Pedigree is.

0;I had hoped that these could be a yummie gluten free ginger snap that would have multi purpose use (such as crumbling them for a dessert base (like tart or pie base). These are not at all what I expected.

0;Got two bags of these for my dog.  For some reason they make him have to go poo almost instantly.  Tried two different flavors and the both make him sick.  He does not normally have intestinal issues.  I'm going back to regular milk bones or zukes.
0;"""I can not wait to try this so called 100% Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee.  It costs more than other Blue Mountains Coffee - over 50 per pound.  I can find cheaper price by other sellers in Amazon.  I thought it more expensive more tasty...  I am wrong.  The coffee bean is not fresh as what the seller described.  From the paper of the Package "
0;"""I did not get the item pictured.  I ordered the Golden Mountain Seasoning Sauce with the green and yellow label.  I received Golden Mountain Sauce with a yellow and red label.  I don't think it is the same thing.  Both products are sold on the site"
0;I refuse to feed the dogs anything made in China. These went straight to the trash can. All manufacturers claim to have great inspection standards and control over what goes into their products---so I must this question: Why make something as basic as a dog treat in China? Is it THAT labor intensive to make these? I think not. I think they are made in China because the regulatory bar is so LOW.
0;This was advertized as an herbal tea sampler of Bigelow and Celestial Seasons products. There were very few teas that met this standard.  The majority were decaffeinated and teas from other manufacturers. There was also a caffeinated breakfast blend! This combination was definately not indicatd in either the picture or the written description!
0;This is the same price per pound I can get at Whole Foods or Giant. The suggested retail in no way matches retail pricing. I can get better pricing on other online sites. I can find this item cheaper at the discount retail stores in my area.<br /> Why have online stores matched retail brick and block stores? $$$$$$$$
0;"""This coffee is weak and a major disappointment. I gambled on this coffee because of the 3 positive reviews. I bought a 24 pack of the Mocha Nut Fudge and I'm seriously considering tossing the 22 remaining k-cups. Sad statement.<br />It's advisable when there are hardly any reviews to look elsewhere for MORE reviews. I found some other sites with dozens of reviews of this coffee and my thoughts on it were confirmed.. I'm not crazy :)<br /><br />How is it disappointing? Well"
0;"""I am severely disappointed in the shipment of five pounds of M&M's .They were delivered to me in an package meant to ship small rigid things in and not something that is fragile like m&ms .When were received them today "

0;This product came on time and in good shape. I can't complain about the Amazon service. The product itself is not good. It is almost inedible. I normally love salmon roe.

0;"""I've got two jars of Alaska Smokehouse Wild Salmon Caviar and when opened one of them looked absolutely dead (very dark pink color caviar) and smelled horrible. The other jar looked OK. I have a photo showing a very visible difference between two jars"
0;Unfortunately this wasnt it. The coffee that I received was significantly substandard and was not the standards that one would expect for this product. The fact that it was also not allowed to be returned due to nonpublished standards of amazon is also problematic. You should know this before purchasing this product that it is in fact not returnable. There are people who seem to have had a positive experience with this purchase from Amazon - I purchased this and did not - this you should know as well as the fact that it is not returnable.

0;DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT.  I received a case of boxes of broken little spaghetti bits.

TERRIBLE.

0;"""I don't understand how anyone with a pair of taste buds to rub together would give this bread a 5 or a 4 or a 3 or even a 2. It's simply gawdawful bread.  I'm not sure that it should be called bread lest the wrong impression be created. I got a sample pack of 20 different breads"
0;"""I bought this item after reading great reviews.  I did not like this coffee at all.  Maybe it's because I really like Dunkin' Donuts vanilla coffee.  Or the Starbucks vanilla lattes.  This coffee has a fake vanilla taste to it that has quite the bite and leaves a horrible taste in your mouth.  Some people like this coffee"
0;"""Its an outright lie that this product is garlic oil.  It is garlic flavored soybean oil an its simply outrageous that they have the gall to market it as garlic oil.  If I wanted oil from gene modified soybeans I could run down to Dollar General and get a lot larger bottle for $1.  Of course I'd have to crush a garlic clove or 2 to flavor it"
0;My rating is truly based on false advertising.  This is NOT a pack of 6 UNLESS there has been a change recently.  I ordered this item believing I would receive 96 teabags as advertised.  I received ONE box of 16 teabags.  Please change this item to accurately reflect what is being sold to the consumer.
0;said 6 boxes were included and only received one box.  Have since fixed the item to read the right amount but I feel that I should have got the listed product.  I use amazon a lot and should not have been scammed like this.  Look what it says above even in this review it says 16 count pack of 6.
0;"""Not sure why these are labled  banana  because they have ZERO flavor of any kind.  Taste like dry cardboard!  Even cheerios have a  taste.   My 10 month old loves puffs but spits these out.  Tried mixing them in a bowl with another brand of banana puffs and these still always get spit out.  Guess they are going in the trash.  SO glad I didn't order a 6pk of these!"""
0;I was going to purchase this until I saw that it has Soy Lecithin in it. Soy is estrogenic and Soy Lecithin in particular is like the crap they scrape off the floor. They pump it into everything and is NOT good for you. Why is it so hard to find food without this crap in it? Especially in food that is supposed to be good for you because it is organic!
0;"""My daughter gobbles puffs up like they're manna from heaven...  Puff  is one of the first words she attempted to say... But this particular flavor she has totally rejected. She gets furious when I try to feed her this"
0;I heard about this product in Australia and so had someone who was coming bring me back 12.  My child does not like them a I think he is too young.  Because he is only 6 months he has only had soft pureed food and is therefore not used to something that is harder.  But I am going to kep trying when he gets older and see how he goes.  They are an amazing product and I really hope he comes around
0;Just purchased it for my automatic espresso machine based on reviews on Amazon. First of all not a good bean for automatic machine too oily. Most importantly was absolutely horrid taste and would never buy the brand again. One thing it will do is jolt you if you want to stay up all night which might be the only reason i would drink it
0;I have ordered this coffee several times and have talked it up to all of my coffee drinking friends. This last bag was so oily it was shiny when I opened the bag and the smell was nauseating. I went ahead and used it thinking that maybe slight exposure to the air and small batch grinding would help but every pot gets worse. My mouth feels like it is coated with oil and I feel like gagging even hours after drinkig my morning cup.<br />I am relunctant to reorder so will probably just go back to Starbucks.<br />Very disappointed.
0;My product should have been delivered a month ago.  This is very bad buisness to think that you can ship something whenever you feel like it.  I am a paying customer that should have been reinbursed in some way for the mistake that your copany made.
0;"""I bought this for my two golden retrievers to share.  I took the plastic off and laid it on the lawn.  One sniffed it and walked away and the puppy licked it once then walked away.

0;"""I was excited to try this decaf variety pack but it arrived today in brown paper bag just like the other review said. some of the k-cups were slightly squished but not broke open. I was very disappointed for 2 reasons:<br />1) The photo in the variety shows 3 of each kind of flavor/brand but my package has 7 of one"
0;The assortment is different than the description  and what is shown in the picture.  Some of the described coffees were not included in the assortment I received.  10 of the 30 K Cups I did get were not included in the description and were brands/flavors I would not have purchased.  Several of the K Cups were expired.  Very disappointed in Amazon.  Overall a bad purchase.  Do not buy this assortment.
0;"""The Caribou Coffee is of course equal and the same as any I could buy in a store or at any other on-line vendor.  The time it took to get to me was unacceptable though.  I will not be ordering my coffee from this vendor again.  I opted to pay for speedier shipping although I was eligible for the free Super Saver on this item"
0;Bulbs arrived 3 days ago. One was broken on arrival due to poor packing. I needed them so I opted not to send them all back. I installed all 5 remaining bulbs and 3 days later one has failed in a puff of foul smelling smoke and two others are flickering. Two are working well. Not a very good average. I bought them because they seemed like a good value - they were less than $5 each. If the two that are working continue to work they'll have cost more than $12 each... not so good! I'd recommend avoiding these.<br />UPDATE: 10 days later one of the flickering bulbs has failed. 3 dead - 1 flickering - 2 good.
0;1 out of 6 bulbs was defective and fizzled out after approximately 10 seconds of being powered on. Doubt I can return just the 1 for a partial refund so I'd recommend for people to buy bulbs individually because of this. The 6 for under $50 deal is good but its really 5 for $50 which is just average. Not to mention the bulbs don't seem quite as sturdy as I'd have hoped them to.<br /><br />Update 3/21 another bulb has burnt out shortly after buying. Now leaving 1 star on this item. Never been unhappy with an item from amazon before...
0;"""I like the bulbs brightness but one out of six was broken. Based on other reviews I guess 1 of 6 is not too bad.<br />Update: I have used these bulbs for three months now. They are fading fast. Now when I turned them on"

This time it was labelled umf instead of bioactive and a white cap compared to the black one I got from last time! Everything else is the same on the label! How could one legit company use two  mehotds for mesuring its activiy??? Also"
0;I purchased this product to treat my staph infection. The seller was very prompt in shipping the honey. I am still using it for the infection but do not know if it will really work. Results remain to be seen over time.

0;"""I have ordered this product before and have always been happy. However I was very disappointed with this order as one of the tubs was NOT extra virgin. The product was yellow and had a burnt smell which means it was not cold pressed extra virgin"
0;Well they didn't even ship this product to my house so they returned my money so at least they returned my money but I never got this so I can't really write a review about something I have never used but they have sent me like 5 e-mails and wont leave me alone until I write one so here it is
0;This was a 2 pack.  One of the jars had obviously been opened before.  The shipping box was slimy from whatever amount of oil seeped out.  So my great deal on a 2 pack turned into an OK deal for a one pack.  I will not purchase a Nutiva product again.  Beware that all grocery items are not able to be returned.

0;Plant showed up about a week after ordering and was covered in a white fungus or mold.. I don't know what to do about it and I don't want to put it near my other plants. I bought it from 9greenbox and I contacted them but am waiting to hear back from them.. The tree does not look like the photo at all and is in a pot that seems way too small for the tree. The tree seems rather weak looking in terms of health and beauty..  I was looking forward to it and was hoping I would get the brussels tree from brussels because the last bonsai I had bought was actually from them and was a great plant.. Do not buy from this seller if you are looking to get the brussels tree..
0;"""A little too sweet for us. However we had no problem swapping it to a friend for some coffee we enjoyed much more. She actually loves the Mocha blend and drinks it frequently.<br />We were glad to have the ability to swap it.<br />Delivery was exceptional as always. Cannot think of a single fault of  Prime Membership .. Thanks Amazon.!!"""
0;If you're expecting rich smooth flavor similar to what you get from a coffee shop you'll be greatly disappointed.  This stuff is basically powdered hot chocolate and instant coffee.  You're better off brewing a pot of Maxwell House and adding some chocolate milk.  I'm extremely disappointed in this stuff.  Maybe I had my hopes set too high.  Yuck!
0;"""I am so disappointed!  After reading the great reviews I decided to order this tea.  I was so excited when it arrived and immediately brewed myself a cup.  It had NO flavor!  It was like drinking warm water.  I find it hard to believe that we are even talking about the same tea here.  Adding a bit of honey did give it some taste"
0;Bought a box of Neuhaus sommelier collection chocolates for a special occasion on a trip through Brussels Duty Free.  When I opened the box I discovered that there were two empty spots in the box!  My husband and I tried two different types of the remaining 14 and were terribly dissappointed in the taste of the chocolate as well.  If you want to purchase chocolates try Godiva!
0;I have a difficult time finding BLUE products in our area. And when I do they frequently don't have exactly what I am looking for.<br /><br />So I was thrilled to find Amazon had several products available.<br /><br />How disappointing to receive the product and find that it was several months past the date stamped on the packaging. As a longtime Amazon shopper I was surprised...I have come to expect great delivery and quality product. I won't order the blue again from this source.
0;The Skinny Cappuccino is a great alternative for those on sugar and/or fat restricted diets. But this price is more than three times the $7.99 per package regular retail price for this product. Buyer beware.
0;I love these noodles when bought in your local market but I bought 3 cases on my first order and all 3 were stail....They resent me 3 more cases and very lil differece in freshness. Id advise not to buy thes on line they are a rotated stock that has not been rotated.
0;"""I tried writing a review previously but I focused on how recieving a bottle w a busted cap and dents on my product didnt make me super happy. I wasnt going to have a container once I took off the foil cause the cap was busted...so I got a plastic container and dumped syrup in there for storage. Tonight"
0;I have tried many different coconut water brands and flavors. This one does not have great flavor compared to other brands. I would not recommend this product...very bland. I should have listened to past reviews.
0;This product is an awful waste of money!!! It started to sprout within a few days as advertised and that is it.  After that the only thing that grew out of this total waste of money were small bugs.  The small sprouts died off and the bugs took over.  What a shame because this seemed like the perfect solution to my apartment blues. Needless to I threw it in the trash after trying everything but CPR to get one little plant.
0;I loved the idea of this but my white colored model turned a bright and very ugly yellow with one grow period. it looks revolting. I contacted the company and they refused to simply replace the top piece which had yellowed like this with one season of normal usage. . I am very disapointed with bot the customer service support as well as the quality of the item.
0;very bad customer service.<br />my mother who is 86 years old bought one for her grandson who happens to be in the Army. She entered the wrong address on the order. She called aerogarden immeidately and Aerogarden customer service told her to order a second one and to fix the address problem on the second order.  Aerogarden could have EASILY rerouted the order to the correct address--she called within 10 minutes of placing the order.  They forced her to order a second one and then they made her pay for the freight to return it to them.  poor customer service all around. very unhelpful.
0;I bought this for a gift for my daughter and later she decided to return it.  Aerogrow does not accept returns after 30 days!  I can see not accepting seed packets but they won't accept the mechanical part- the garden device!  I find that quite customer-unfriendly.
0;Bought a unit for my 80 year old Mother at Christmas. Great for a month. And the pump started making noise. Got so bad she had to turn it off. Emailed the company and they sent a new pump out. That one lasted another month. Noise could be heard all over the house. Emailed company again. No reponse. Called several times. Customer service got back to me and said they had a batch of faulty pumps from China and new ones were arriving the beginning of April. They had been redesigned. One would be shipped by the 15th of April. Its now June 4th and nothing. I have left several messages with customer service. Hoping one of these days someone will call me back and take care of this. With the kits and shipping this cost me over $200. And I am unable to return it since almost 6 months has passed. I should of returned it right away.
0;"""I received the Aerogarden as a gift. I have a green thumb and can grow anything. I looked forward to having fresh herbs to cook with. There are several things that make this product quite bad.<br /><br />1.) The light is a beacon! The grow light has to be on 14-15 hours a day and is incredibly bright. This won't be a problem if you have a kitchen far away from your bedroom but if you have an apartment it will present a problem.<br /><br />2.)It does not work. I tried once to grow the herbs exactly as instructed. It didn't work. The plants grew only a little bit and then died after a few weeks. I ordered more seed pods to try again"
0;I have had several aerogardens over the last four years. I recently purchased two new 7 pod gardens (pro 100).  Up to this time I was a satisfied customer albeit you have to either read up on what grows best or just practice a lot.  Recently I received new universal grow pods that are supposed to fit in all the aerogarden models.  Despite what customer service says they do not fit well in my 7 pod.  Worse is that the new grow pods do not hold the grow medium near the top of the pod.  The new universal pods promote mold and rot and discourage germination.  Up to this point I would have highly recommended this product but not now or until they create a better grow pod.
0;"""I wrote a long review of this product--I purchased three(3)--and then decided it was too long for anyone to wade through.  So the following is the Reader's Digest version:<br /> YOU'LL LOVE IT--OR YOUR MONEY BACK <br /><br /> That's what's in large print at the top of the Aerogarden guarantee.  And in the TV ad the founder of the company goes even further and says he'll even pay return shipping charges.<br /><br />I don't have my three aerogardens now.  To me they're not worth wasting electricity on.  And did Aerogarden refund my money?  No.  But they did send me a form-type letter indicating no responsibility on their part because more than  36 DAYS had passed and I'd purchased the aerogardens from Amazon.  SO MY SUGGESTION IS TO READ THE FINE PRINT AND GOOD LUCK!"""
0;"""I received this product three months ago.  The first seeds started to grow then died within a few weeks. The customer service center is taking a month or more to get back to customers.  Two months later they say that they will send me a new package of seeds. Great except after one week the bulb burnt out after only a total of three weeks of use (2 at the beginning and one this time).  So"
0;I received a 7 pod aero garden a couple years ago as a Christmas gift.  For 2 years I really liked it.  I had fresh herbs all winter long it was great.  Then last Christmas I received more seeds to plant.  I got the seeds all ready and plugged in the Aero garden.  It was broke and unfixable and the warranity had run out.  I really would like another one but it is not worth the money for just 2 years.

0;Disappointed in the product...delivery was fine.  the sugar layer between the tasty chocolate and the vodka filling makes the product extra crunchy.  Frazer chocolates are fantastic...disappointed by this particular angle on it.

0;This stuff is like chewing a flavorless piece plastic. I have been buying Gustaf's sugar free Licorice and thought I would try this one. Mistake I don't think the dog will even eat this stuff. Going back to my Gustaf's.
0;I have had very good sugar free chewy black licorice before but these were not.  Sugar free were the only thing they were.  Otherwise they were hard but flavorless.

0;For some reason the makers of Twist have recently replaced their naturally sweetened waters (using Agave) with Stevia Extract so the product now has 0 calories instead of 9. The Agave sweetened product was great and I was drinking a couple dozen of these a month. Now its just like all the other flavored 0 calorie waters using artificial sweeteners with the typical aftertaste. Very dissapointing.

My cats wouldn't touch it and after putting it outside by a garbage can where the stray cats in my hood congregate"
0;I purchased these candies hoping for a good tasting soft licorice candy.  Ummm...no on both accounts.  Taste was miles away from any of the licorices Ive had and these things were hard as rock.  Oh well...at least I tried them.

The jerky was so hard it was like chewing leather. I don't mind my jerky on the harder side but my jaw hurt after a couple pieces. I also found fish bones in my jerky which I think is unacceptable especially for the cost of the product.
0;"""This product does not have an overpowering smell of salmon and taste-wise it was ok. It sort of taste like a piece of onion with salt and a bit of pepper.<br /><br />I bought this today for the first time thinking it would be great because it was Salmon. I was wrong"

0;The pudding changes to the green color immediately - very misleading description on the box.  It also made my son's poop turn the same color as the pudding (greenish/teal) and actually stained his bottom green too! (He wears diapers). So not worth it.
0;I purchased this bag of candy at Christmas to compliment a cookie assortment I was sending in to my husband's work.  Seeing as I had already had a bunch of sugar that day I just loaded up the plates with both the chocolate and the cookies without sampling one.

0;"""The texture is fine but this has a very odd background flavor to it. I've tried to place it and think it might be from the coconut but I'm just not sure. Though I enjoyed this brand's Oatmeal Raisin granola"
0;The taste is disgusting and I am having to struggle just to keep it down! I hope that it does increase my milk supply but I don't know if I'm even going to finish the box. I'm trying Mild Maid next time since the taste is supposedly better.

The first flavor ingredient is Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) which gives me fuzzy headaches.  I have been unable to eat the seeds.  I tried soaking them in water and then soaking them in some Jack Daniels and drying them out in the oven.  Now they taste ok and have way less MSG but I still miss the old formula!"""

In addition"
0;I bought this for my lunch...Thank goodness it was only .94 becuase it was terrible.  The Flavor is just not good.  I think it comes from the fake bacon bits.  Maybe the four cheese will taste better.  but the loaded is not worth trying.

0;Most of the time when I give this product to my cat she ends up vomiting it back up.  I asked my vet and she said that several of her patients have experience the same result.  I tried asking on the Internet if others had the same experience and was shocked by the number who said their cats responded the same.  I put the cat on a different product and she stopped her vomiting....  I would suggest that anyone using this product with poor results try a different cat food.

0;"""I usually love these bars and was so happy to find them on Amazon but when they arrived the chocolate on the outside was discolored and crumbly.  Maybe it was because of the warmer weather and the chocolate melted and rehardened"
0;Don't waste your money on this bar.  It has to be the worst bar I've ever tried to eat.  I had one bite.  Too bad I can't send the box back.  I even shared with a co-worker who had the same opinion and did not want more than the one bite she tried.  I was hoping they would be good.
0;"""Tried Paul Prudhome's Salt Free Magic Seasoning and it's a complete dud. Adds nothing remotely salt like to the flavor. Hard even to detect the chile pepper that is supposed to flavor it. It is as if it had been on the shelf for 10 years and the spices lost their zip"
0;"""The Sweet n Sour sauce pictured is bright red and VERY similar in looks to the Sweet n Sour sauce you get from Chinese food restaurants.  I ordered a case of this stuff for $ 19 and was very disappointed in it.  The sauce I received is a brownish color with bits of red and green pepper in it.  It's not very sweet like you would expect (and hope) it to be.  The label on the sauce I rec'd was totally different also.  The one online is the 'New and Improved' label and the one I rec'd was not.<br /><br />My opinion is that if you're looking for the traditional restaurant style sweet n sour sauce then this is definitely not it.  Now I have to figure out what to do with an entire case of this cruddy stuff.  It would be one thing if the sauce was just different but I actually don't like the flavor at all.  Oh well"
0;"""I eat a fair number of different prepared meals for lunches at work and think this is the worst meal I have eaten in years. The meat wasn't terrible but wasn't great. The mashed potatoes and gravy were so bad"

0;You should disclose when items are not being sold from the US or shipped.  I purchased this as standard delivery with the assumption it was coming from the US not Canada because this was being shipped from Canada it did not fall into the standard shipping guidelines and was not received in time for Christmas NOW i have to take the time to contact the vendor to see if they will accept a return and pay for the shipping - this would cause me NOT to do future purchase on amazon.com

0;I bought this today because I am absolutely in love with a certain coffee chain based out of seattle's chai tea latte. I was hoping that this would help me save a little money and still give me that delicious taste. Wrong. This was soooo sweet. I have the biggest sweet tooth out of anyone I know and i couldn't even drink one of these. Not worth it.
0;My family loves these beans and I have ordered them before. The first shipment had 2 or 3 cans with small dents. My last order had 9 of 12 cans that were severely dented. This did not happen in shipping. The box was in good condition and packaged well by Amazon. Most of the dents are on the inside cans of the package.It seems that they come this way from the manufacturer. Amazon is sending me a replacement case and I hope they are in better shape.<br /><br />UPDATE: My replacement case came and 11 of 12 cans have dents. Amazon has refunded my money. I contacted Walnut Creek and they said they only sell Amazon first quality products and they are not sure how the cans are getting dented. I would not suggest purchasing these beans from Amazon.
0;This product has such a chemical taste to it.  I decided to try a few flavors of Stevita despite some of the bad reviews.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  I'd rather put bleach in my coffee than to ever try this product again

0;I used to buy all the earths best products for my kids. My 18 month old loved the Elmo pasta and sauce that comes in a can. However after purchasing a case of the Elmo pasta and sauce I opened the can and found bugs! There were tiny bugs that looked like baby roaches!!! I continued to open all the cans in the case to find they all contained 2-4 bugs per can!!! I called the company and was offered coupons as a compensation. She assured me that this was an isolated Incident. I told The company to keep their coupons because I will never be purchasing their products again! Makes me wonder what their plant looks like. I am throughly disgusted that I have been feeding my 6 month old the jars of baby food. Just wanted to make others aware......
0;I would not recommend this product. The first one that arrived was returned because it was spoiled. The packing material was bubble wrap with two ice packs inside of an insulated bag. The second one arrived and I decided not to use it as well because it was lukewarm and I was afraid of getting sick. Shocking how it was packaged!
0;We love POP CHIPS. Pop Chips are the best snack for our family because we need to be Gluten Free. And POP CHIPS are delicious. The six 6.25oz bags we received from Amazon were SMASHED so they were POP CRUMBS! Amazon did nothing about it. Do NOT BUY FROM AMAZON! Buy POP CHIPS from your local store.
0;These are basically a carmel toffee with very little coffee flavor. The pieces are uncomfortably large.

0;"""I have been trying many Basmati Rice in order to find the best taste and texture and I am terribly disappointed by this India Gate rice which tastes AWFUL ! like the bag that contains it. It smells bad and tastes worse of course ! I have been wasting money because I know that Amazon will never reimburse me or exchange it for another better brand. I will go back to the Tilda rice that even if it doesn't have a  basmati  taste"
0;These were the worst nacho chips I have ever had. The chips were two-sided with a thin hollow middle section between them that broke easily. They crumbled quickly when eating and had an unpleasant flavor. The cheapest store brand is better.
0;I have been buying dried peaches all the time through Sahara. My local store has increased the price this year and I started looking on Amazon. Found this one and ordered. It took almost a month to arrive and smells terrible. I am pretty sure that the manufacturer used Sulfur dioxide to process the peaches and left this stinky smell. I was in a hurry to travel to EU for a month right after I received the peaches and was not able to file a return. Do not buy if you care about your health. The product description does not include using this chemical for processing. I gave one start because I could not give lower.
0;"""I had ordered 2 bottles of the hot sauce and also paid 1-3 day shipping on it.  I actually paid more for the shipping than I did for the 2 bottles of sauce.  I did not receive my packagae until 9 days later but I was shorted a bottle.  I wrote to the company and told them of this.  They agreed to sending me another bottle free of shipping.  Mind you"
0;"""I have been opening all the little drawers in my mind to try to find the memory of this taste but have struck out. I think it's the faint hint of curry but it really doesn't belong here. I agree that the  pasta  isn't bad but it isn't the best GF I've ever had"
0;This stuff tastes awful !!! I threw it all out and bought a pound of organic chamomile leaves here on Amazon - do your life a flavor and get yo mighty self away from this tea company !!! San Rafael Ca? yuck!!!

0;I purchased 2 pkgs of these unsweetened banana chips. I really thought they would be similar to other banana chips that are sweetened.  I wanted some with just a little sweetness but not as sweet as what is normally on the market.  However - I don't like to say anything bad about anything but these absolutely taste like cardboard - there is absolutely NO taste ( you would never guess you were eating bananas if you were blindfolded) and the texture is like cardboard also.  I WOULD NEVER PURCHASE THEM AGAIN.  Sorry... wish I could say something positive about these but I can't in all honestly.
0;Don't waste your money on these.  They have no taste at all.  I used them in a cookie recipe and not one person could tell me what flavor they were.  I gave them one star  because evidently a rating necessary.  It doesn't deserve one or any part of a star!
0;BOX WAS SMASHED AND THE DONUTS WERE ALL STICKY AND MELTED ICING ALL OVER THE BOX... WORSE BUY TO MAKE FOR THE SUMMERTIME.. I HAVE LEARNED MY LESSON ON MAKING THIS MY OWN PERSONAL IMPULSE BUY...<br /><br />NEVER GOING TO BUY THIS ITEM AGAIN...
0;I received these sprinkles as a gift to use to decorate cupcakes for my son's birthday party.  Before putting them on I ate a few and am so glad I did.  These taste awful!  There is no way I could serve these to guests.  It is a really cute idea and would have been perfect for the dinosaur themed party but the taste has to be addressed.
0;not happy at all about this product. Overpriced and much smaller than portrayed online. After my purchase I found a site with more product in the bag for $2.98. Will never purchase from this retailer again.
0;"""I first bought a pack of 12 at $38. The price is now up by $30 to $68. This is insane and in no way does this fairly reflect the hike in gas prices. I could see a $5.00 raise ... maybe. But $30? These were $3.16 a can a year ago. They're now $5.67 a can. Any grocery store raising their prices that much"
0;I love the Asian Pear and Fuji Apple freeze dried fruit so thought I'd try the Mandarin orange crisps.  I was unpleasantly surprised by the bitter taste of this product.  Four of us tried it and none of us like it so I will throw the remaining pouches away.  Waste of money.
0;I recieved the yeast in a few days (exactly what the fedex tracking said) when I checked the date it expired on 12/2007! and it was removed from its original packaging. I am not at all pleased with the company that sent it.
0;Dixie Carb Counters Dine 'n Dash Cream of Mushroom Soup Mix is not a cream of mushroom soup at all. It's vey watery and the taste isn't good at all. I do not recommend this product for low carb dieters.
0;Check the description before you buy. The price I paid was for a single packet.  Don't assume that because the price is similar to what you might pay for 8 or 10 of these packets at your local grocery store that you are getting more than a single packet. That didn't pan out so well for me and I am returning the item.
0;"""I purchased the Torani brand based on my previous experiences with Torani syrups and products but I am not too satisfied with this specific flavor.  Opening up the bottle it definitely smells like what you would get out of a pumpkin pie"

0;3 bottles of grape juice 32 ounces each is expensive this way.<br />And.............. had it had a small degree fo grape taste i would not have minded...<br />Just because the grapes are organic does not mean they need be TASTELESS!!!<br />the packaging was ridiculous.............an overhwelming need to wrap it in celephane...then plastic puffy bags....totally unecessary
0;I haven't had a Werther's candy for a long time so I bought the little box of sugar free - had a couple and then read the ingredients which include Acesulfame-K.  look it up - in my opinion it's poison - worse than aspartame that companies use in diet soft drinks that affects the circulation of the brain.  I see more and more people reading the labels on products in the aisles of the supermarkets.  Read the labels -

0;"""Be careful what you order.  These are 1/4 oz 'pouches  for almost the same cost as the larger 1oz. pouches.  The snacks are already priced kind of high and I feel ripped off by this company charging 4X the price for a smaller pouch."""

0;"""I was delighted when I found this item and ordered it to replace my treasured old Melitta 6-cup porcelain drip pot that had been dropped and broken.  The original pots were made in Germany and had a nicely sculptured shape.  Most important was their uniquely designed spout with its small hole that prevented coffee from dripping down the side of the pot when it was poured.  I don't know whether that spout design is patented and often wondered why its simplicity and effectiveness was never copied.<br /><br />The item that I received from Amazon was a very poor Chinese imitation of the original.  I would have returned it but it is not returnable (buyers beware!).  The shape of the pot is clumsy and thicker than the original.  The spout drips when liquid is poured from it.  Detailing of the filter is less refined and it may not work as well.  Even the box with its ersatz Melitta logo is too small for the pot"
0;"""I have used Melitta pots for around 30 years.  I have always had the plastic filter cone with the clear glass pot.  The coffee always ran freely from the cone to the pot.  I tried this pot because I thought it was an upgrade.  I had a lot of difficulty getting the coffee to flow.  The pot is visually beautiful"
0;"""The design of this product is fatally flawed. Notice on all manual drip coffee makers the ridges on the sides and around the hole. This keeps the filter just far enough away from the filter to let coffee flow. This one has ridges"
0;I have had this item for years and I finally stopped using it because the ceramic drip cone does not drain very well. The coffee and water must create a vacuum and I have to lift up the paper cone and jiggle it to get the flow going. Sometimes the filter tears and then it's a real mess. I have also used the Melitta plastic cones and those drain perfectly.
0;"""For starters this lid does not fit.  It is supposed to be held on by two little  bumps  on the edge of the lid but they are not flared out far enough.  The end result is that the lid easily falls off.<br /><br />Further"
0;This was going to be a Christmas gift.I opened this package as soon as I got it. The leaves on the tree were all brown. Not one note on caring for the tree.  It was really sad to see such a sick tree. I would love to try to nurse it back to health but I don't want to gamble my money away if I can't.  I will be shipping this back today.  I tried to call them but they said I had to go thru Amazon for any questions or returns and they wouldn't speak with me.
0;The bonsai tree is almost dead in few days the leaves are falling just after one day of arrival.<br /> I am still trying to maintain it but<br />It looks almost dead. I am not satisfied at all with this product. I generally don't write reviews but this time every day I see the bonsai I get upset of buying it online. I should have put extra dollar and buy it from store. I even took pics but don't know how to attach it on review.

0;Before I would buy this product I would need to read the label completely.  No information is given.  Just because the product is gluten free does not mean that it doesn't contain other objectionable ingredients.<br /><br />I hope someone at Amazon reads this.
0;"""I totally agree with those expressing their requests for more ingredient information.  There are so many gluten-free products on the market now because it's  popular  to do so and bucks can be made.  I recently opened a wheat-free"
0;This item is not worth the price as it is only 2 lbs. worth of candy. You can get a 4 lb bag at Walmart for less than $9.00 and afford to throw away the flavors you don't like. This item would be worth 5 or 6 bucks.

0;I was delighted to have dried mushrooms that I could use for cooking. They tasted like rubber...tough and awful. This is the first bad review I've ever written. But wanted to save the consumer. (It was too much trouble to find more packaging and pay to ship them back.<br />I guess we learn as we go. Good luck to all!
0;I have never paid so much for a box of junk in my life. I would have returned it but didn't want to pay more. I would not buy this again. Why does it cost more to leave out the sugar? back to the drawing board manufacturers. I hate your bownie mix.

The two cases I purchased arrived chewy and clumped together.  They probably cooked during shipping and are not a  Raw Food  and not as  Nutritious  anymore.  Two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened.  Amazon.com does not accept grocery returns.  It was a waste of $40."""
0;I have had freezed dried blueberries before so I had an expectation. Some of them were crunchy(like they should be) and others were the consistancy of styrofoam. More were of the chewy foam type. I would not purchase these again.

0;Breakfast blend is no longer the mild coffee flavor that I have come to enjoy for the past few years. It is now a medium coffee with noticeable burnt flavor along with some bitterness. I don't know why Starbucks messed with a good thing but after reading that their new line of blonde coffees offers no taste at all I will now be forced into looking for a new mild blend of coffee. I bought mine from target with the new packaging that says medium. I hope Starbucks returns to the original formula that made Breakfast blend so good.

0;I have healthy 45 year old teeth and broke a large chuck off my front tooth eating this cereal.  The chunks in my box reminded me of gravel it was so hard.

Watch out for hard chunks hard enough to break your teeth.

The expense of returning the product is not worth it so therefore I will have to be  creative  by mixing it with my Y.S. organic honey or my organic sugar as I hate to discard the product. I used it in a cup of hot tea and the taste was ghastly to say the least.

0;"""We recently purchased the 2 lb. bag of Krusteaz Buttermilk Pancake Mix and when we received it the bag was sealed. While serving pancakes to my family I bit into some crunchy pieces and immediately thought  oh I must have accidentally dropped an eggshell into the batter.  After biting into another crunchy bit and then getting a jab in my mouth it dawned on me (duh) that all I added was water. I immediately told the family to stop eating!  I investigated further to find large shards of glass in the pancakes (two of them 3/4 of an inch long).  The measuring cup that I used was metal and the only glass in the process was the mixing bowl which after careful examination revealed no signs of chipping and it wasn't broken - it was fully intact.  I poured a cup of the dry mix from the original bag into a sieve and found pieces of glass - including small chunks (1-2mm in size) as well as additional shards.  I then contacted Continental Mills (the company who makes Krusteaz) as well as the FDA.  Let me be clear on something - I have no interest in any sort of legal action - I simply wanted to be heard.  Other than that I suppose that I wanted to hear them apologize.  I thought that was fair especially after I just served glass to my 1"
0;I have bought this brand for several years and my family has always enjoyed the pancakes. The formula had to be changed in the last order of 4 boxes I received. The taste was not good.

0;When I opened the box the sauce leaked all over the package because there was no safety seal under any of the caps of the bottle.

0;"""I puchased this container for Easter Baskets for my allergic to everything boys.  I couldn't get the recipe on Amazon which is odd because most things claiming to be good for people with allergies have the ingredients readily available.  In any event I went to their website which has toggles for the ingredients list but don't do anything when you click on them.  The site proudly boasts  No High Fructose Corn Syrup  though.  I sent an email query out and it's been a few days with no response.  The question was simple  Is there any corn product in the Jelly Beans or Sour Bunnies?   I've never given a bad review but in light of the fact that the jelly beans' very fist ingredient is corn syrup at the very least for $25 they should taste as good or close to something like Jelly Belly.  They taste like Jelly Beans and nothing more"
0;The quality of the items in this gift set are terrible. The food is just awful -- even my kids wouldnt eat the cookies. The spa items had no scent. Better to spend the money on a small gift set from a better known company.

0;"""I have purchased chicken chips in the past and they were not from China.  Shortly after purchasing this order my dog became sick.  I cannot say it was from this order of chicken chips but he got sick shortly after I started feeding him this order of chicken chips.  I had to pay a $500 vet bill when my dog had blood in his urine.  The vet could not determine what caused the urinary tract infection.  My sister told me to check the container to see if the product came from China"
0;Never would have ordered these if they had put the country of origin in the description.  Be aware that these are produced in China.<br />Stick with the Smokehouse Beefy Bites which are made in the USA.
0;I'm very familiar with this coffee and I really like it. But the coffee that I was sent was very old and was a total rip-off! If you read the other reviews they thought it was great but apparently I was sent coffee from the same batch 18 months later. The coffee is old and not worth the money anymore. I was cheated!
0;This mug arrived broken in the box. The insert rim was shattered and the whole thing jammed down into the mug so you couldn't pull it out. There did not appear to be a way to return this item which was the frustrating part. After a lot of poking around on the Amazon web site I sent my concern to the contact us option. I received a prompt email back and after minimal back and forth Amazon offered to replace the damaged product. I appreciate this and even though I had to hunt around to figure out how to get this fixed -- fixed it is!  Cute mug -- I hope my brother is going to like it now that I can give it to him in one piece!
0;"""I received this order in a nice Amazon box sold by Amazon sent from an Amazon warehouse. Not and I repeat not from Lesser Evil who should not be held responsible for this mess. I opened the Amazon box to find a damaged"
0;Five stars for the coffee.  One star for the misleading description on the page.  The first line of the description states:<br /><br />2 x 12 ounce bags of Peet's Major Dickason's Blend Whole Bean coffee<br /><br />What an excellent price for two twelve ounce bags!  That's because you don't get two twelve ounce bags.  You only get one.  No returns allowed!  Fix the wording Amazon!!
0;"""I researched many formulas before purchasing this one because it seemed the MOST organic and safe for my baby. On 2/16/12 Consumer Reports published research indicating that formulas containing organic brown rice syrup -- the first ingredient in Baby's Only formula -- have high levels of arsenic.<br /><br />From Consumer Reports:  Two of 17 infant formulas tested listed organic brown rice syrup as the primary ingredient. One had a total arsenic concentration that was six times the federal limit of 10 parts per billion (ppb) for total arsenic in bottled or public drinking water. This is particularly worrisome for babies because they are especially vulnerable to arsenic's toxic effects due to their small size and the corresponding arsenic consumption per pound of body weight. <br /><br />It did not list the brands of formula"
0;"""I used this formula for my baby from 6 weeks old to 1 year after trying to nurse unsuccessfully.  He tolerated it well and I thought this was a terrific product while using it.  I am now horrified to learn about the extremely high arsenic levels found in organic brown rice syrup in a very recent Darmouth College study.  Nature's One conducted a study to test the arsenic levels"
0;"""I have been feeding my Grandson this formula for a few months.He enjoyed the taste and I thought it was the best formula out there. Now I heard on the national news that it has dangerous levels of arsenic in the brown rice syrup.What next!So after searching for another good formula"
0;I don't know what I was thinking. The carrot powder looks yellowish. Probably all the beta carotene are all gone. I hoping to use them on my smoothies but it's has no taste to it. It looks and smells old. I can smell the plastic bag better than the carrot powder. No details if it's freeze dried or regular drying method. This would affect on what's left nutritionally.
0;"""Well I have to say that these were the worst tasting cupcakes I have ever tried from a package mix. I bought them at the recommendation of a local store owner since I was in a hurry for a quick dessert and didn't have everything I needed for my fancy"
0;"""Let me start by saying I love Barilla sauces. It's the only sauce I buy in the jar to use and their marinara in the jar is the best base I've ever used. This however was terrible. I was completely disappointed. I heated it as per instructions but needed to heat it another 45 seconds after mixing it up in a microwaveable bowl because it was only just warm. It is not very spicy at all and I could mainly only taste tomatoes. The pasta had a very strange taste to it"
0;"""Package arrived broken.  All bottles were broken and soda was spilled everywhere.  Box was wet and we were not even able to salvage any soda.  I gave one star due to this fact.  I'm sure the soda is good"
0;"""I found a bottle of this at a candy and novelty shop at the coast. I brought it home and shared it with my family. All four of us LOVE bacon. It's one of the best-tasting things in the known universe. This drink has absolutely NOTHING in common with that taste. It's sorta sweet"
0;"""I purchased the Lyle's Golden Syrup because my grocery store quit selling it and this seemed a great alternative. The package of 6 bottles arrived this morning and upon opening the poorly packed box I found a bottle had been broken in transit. Had there been proper packaging I'm certain I wouldn't be frustrated. Hopefully"
0;I have been a licorice lover all my life and black licorice laces are my favorite type of licorice.  This product has been impossible to find where I live.  I have searched every store around but no store supplies black licorice laces.  After finding it on Amazon I ordered it immediately but I was very dissatisfied with the taste of Gustaf's licorice.  It didnt taste like the real black licorice but some artificial substitute and it was way too soft.  It didn't please me any more than the Twizzlers do.  It's just not a real licorice flavor.  I would never order Gustaf's licorice again.
0;"""I bought these thinking they would be great because they are Annie's.  I usually enjoy anything made by Annie's.  But they have terrible texture and very little flavor.  Tastes like the oats haven't been cooked"
0;"""I buy mine from the local middle eastern store in NY and it costs me $1.59 for the 10 oz bottle. This is ridiculously overpriced. Just bought one yesterday to make some desserts and cookies. This brand"
0;I only used a 1/4 cup of this rose water in a sauce I was making. It has left a BAD after taste for 2 days now. I have used a different rose water for this same sauce which was really delicious. This rose water came with great reviews which is why I purchased it. VERY OVERRATED & VERY DISAPPOINTING !
0;This is the first and last time I will be ordering food from Amazon. My 4 year old is addicted to Mini Nilla Wafers. I can't seem to find them in any stores where I live so I had to resort to ordering online. The cookies were extremely soggy and stale. DO NOT order food online. It's not worth it!
0;"""The  yeast extract  in this product acts as MSG does. It is ridiculous that Annie's markets itself as a healthy company for kids and then fills their products with insane amounts of sodium and food additives. Please research all the ingredients before giving these to your children"
0;"""I've recently switched to drinking instant coffee due to time constraints and other reasons I won't get into on here. Let's just say I've drank hundreds of cups of instant over the last few months. Before drinking instant"
0;If you love your paprika smoked were just the smell of it makes you say aaaahhhhhh and you love the smoky taste it gives any food.I would not recommend this brand!As it is barely smoky.Before I tried this brand I feel in love with Especias delSol hot smoked paprika-which is good and smoky with only a touch of hot.When I could not find it anymore I decided to try this brand.Let me say I was really disappointed.
0;received the item and the top was also loose as was on the rose water I ordered. The bottle leaked all over the packing and label was soaked....  very POOR quality control. this is two items I have recieved with the tops open...  will never order from them again...........
0;"""First and foremost I would suggest taking Juice Plus to anyone as I've always benefited from its health benefits over the past 15 years.<br /><br />My problem is with the seller Salk trading of KY. My reasoning is: Juice Plus always arrives in boxes with a 3 month supply in each box. Salk Trading advertised Juice Plus on Amazon for $49.99 would be a great deal for a 3 month supply as its usually $100. I purchased 2 orders for $99.98 thinking I would be getting a 6 month supply. Much to my dismay"
0;"""I'm a long time drinker of Jasmine Pearl tea -- when I saw this product listing I thought it was too good to be true (a pound?  at such a low price!).  I was right:  it's *very* low quality tea.  It doesn't have the subtle jasmine flavor that's supposed to be present in this tea -- it's bitter and simply doesn't taste good.  Stick with the Numi brand of Jasmine Pearl ... it's fresh with wonderful flavor"
0;This tea is a rip off- is not 16 oz and tastes terrible. I will never purchsae again and feel that Amazon should remove it from it site due to ruining the reputation of Amazon. All other products have been great except this one.
0;This is way too expensive for sour cabbage!  I can go to a grocery store (like the ones with a food center) and get their brand for a fraction of the price!  Why would you charge this much for sauerkraut?  That is ridiculous n this economy!  Love the kraut will not pay that price.  Get the price reduced and put it on prime.  THEN I will buy it!
0;"""The jerky is the driest I have ever come across and crumbles as soon as you put it in your mouth.  Taste is terrible but I guess you would have to be able to get past the texture to better judge the flavor.  Even my dog doesn't like the jerky"
0;"""I am someone who LOVES beef jerky and I was hoping this tasted better than it does.  It has a very strange texture (a dry mushy testure - if there is such a thing) and the taste was strange (carboard like and bland).  I like to buy healthy snacks and food items so I was hoping this would taste much better.  I was expecting a difference in taste and texture due to the lack of MSG which does add a lot of salt flavor and texture to traditional beef jerky BUT this just out right does not taste good. I can sacrifice for the benefit of a more natural product but I found this jerky to be beyond my threshold of tolerance.<br /><br />  I am hoping to try and use it as dog treats so the purchase is not a complete waste and also add a bag to my hurricane supplies (as a food of last resort).  I would suggest trying to locate this product locally and trying it before you buy it in the bulk 6 bag size from Amazon to make sure it is a taste and texture you would like"
0;the jerky was so tough i was only able to eat 1 out of ever 3 pieces. was a complete was of money. i'm very disappointed in the product. the only positive is that it is low sodium (either by make or by the fact that only a few pieces are edible)
0;"""When I think  dark roast  I think full bodied and DARK.  Melitta pods are the worst I've tried.  I've tried Senseo pods too which are only mediocre.  I did find the Target brand  Archer Farms  pods to be the BEST.  The French Roast really does rival Starbucks home brewed.  Its cheap too...3.99 for 18 pods.  If you like a full bodied"
0;I did not care for this product at all.  I was expecting more of a Demerara sugar taste and this is WAY more intense.  Tried to use it in iced tea - taste burnt.  PLUS - beware - you can't return it.  It is a grocery item on Amazon and they won't accept returns.  I'd find some somewhere to try before buying these big containers.  I used one cup and hated it and then had to just give it away.
0;"""This is the worst crystallized ginger I've ever had the misfortune to encounter.  Rather like suger-coated wood chips in sub-standard packages.  They might be suitable for boiling to make ginger tea but the flavor is nothing to write home about.  I would avoid this stuff.

I have emailed and got a form letter- I want my CHIPS!! The frustration has caused the hair on the wolves on my  three wolf/one moon  t-shirts hair to fall out"
0;"""I bought these for my 10 month old daughter thinking they would be great for teething and snacking. These cookies gave my baby a terrible rash and the runs. She normally never has these kinds of reactions to food. Never again Gerber"
0;I love flavored coffee so thought I would try this.  This has to be the worst tasting coffee I have ever had.  I can't say it even tasted like coffee at all not much less having any type of flavor. Maybe the one I tried had something wrong but now stuck with having to toss out the rest of the box!<br />Very disappointed!  I will stay with my Hazelnut and French Vanilla
0;"""Let me start off with the coffee itself which is pretty good. I will say that these coffee's (green mountain and such) have really huge swings. I've bought cases that were wonderful and the next will have a burnt aftertase or be noticably weaker in comparison so realize that these reviews may be reflective of the wild inconsistant nature of the brand...<br /><br />Now for the major point"
0;"""I tried these despite the negative reviews hoping they were wrong.  They weren't!!  Only at the very end of the cup of coffee did I detect a tiny hint of the cinnamon.  I do not know why or quite frankly how"
0;"""I don't like coffee and this K-Cup is one of the reasons why. It doesn't taste anything at all like a Cinnamon Roll. I need a strong flavored coffee in order for me to be able to drink it.  It kind of reminds me of taking medication. I only bought this coffee because I am currently on a diet and this is pretty much all I can have in the morning. Maybe it is because I can't have any creamer"
0;"""We have enjoyed using regular Splenda for years so when they came out with Splenda Essentials we thought we'd try one with Vitamin B...... We should have realized that there was a problem as soon as the packet was opened.... The smell of the vitamin was there and when you put it in your coffee"
0;"""Someone bought a box of this for our office accidentally and I immediately noticed a distinct aftertaste and smell versus regular Splenda. It is the same smell that I get when I open my multivitamin bottle and I don't want that smell or taste in my tea. I will not use this product again. By the way"
0;"""Mini-charcoal briquets:  This Sumatran whole-bean coffee is a good example of an environmentally and socially Green choice that bears no relation to the drinkability (is that a word??) of the coffee.  If you like how Starbucks' coffee used to be"
0;We bought a sample pack of coffee containing a few of these and it was the worst one of 15 different kinds of decaf in the lot. I love the coffee fron the Caribou coffee shop in my town and thought this would be the same but it was far from it.  A bitter aftertaste. Since it was a veriety pack it is possible the coffee was old or something.
0;I ordered 4 bags of these cookies and 95% of the cookies in each bag was crumbled. I wasn't positive that they were all broken until we opened the last bag. I ended up discarding about 1/2 of the cookies.
0;The spices on the peanuts detract from the peanut taste.  I have taken a handful and washed them in water to get rid of the spices.  I don't know anyone who has tried them that thought that the spices enhanced the taste of the nuts.
0;"""Beware if your Cocker is allergic to wheat or corn.  This food is full of grains that are known to cause allergies in dogs.  I bought this for my niece's Cocker Spaniel who has skin allergies.  Initially there was no problem and not only did the dog love the food"

0;i purchased a 4 week  chianti wine kit [ vino italiano ]  the wine is like it is watered down. they dont give you enough juice. also it is suppose to be around 11%  mine came out at 8%  i ended up throwing it out.  also purchased a shiraz and a pinot chardany and the shiraz spoiled when i added the chitosan. the pinot chardany is also a very weak wine.
0;"""I have two boxers that love to chew.  I bought these hoping to entertain my kids for an hour or so!  After 5 minutes they were gone and both dogs were looking at me like  What now?   Way too expensive for 5 minutes of entertainment."""
0;The product is great! However Amazon does not seem to know how to deal with the international market.  These are produced by Ferrero in Italy or at least in Europe. If one does a simple search in Amazon for this product you find two correct results and many fake results - the fake results are for a Hazelnut product (another Ferrero product but NOT Mon Cheri) The first product costs only $13 dollars with product count of 60 the second product costs $20 dollars for a product count of 30 (1/2) !!!<br />The first provider will not accept a shipping address in Italy (EU) - The second provider will accept a shipping address in Italy - however at more than twice the cost of the product!!!!  $50 shipping on a $20 product!<br /><br />AMAZON is clearly colaborating in this activity - AMAZON - GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER  Amazon should be responsible for doing the appropriate market research for a just and fair international market -- if not - what is Amazon as a world market provider doing for us???
0;Tastes like vomit in a jar.  Same goes for the Velveeta Cheese & Salsa Dip.  Not to mention it's h*ll on your dishes.<br /><br />I poured a little in a bowl and went to enjoy it with some chips.  Was able to force down about 5 chips with it before I pushed it away in disgust.  I was so repulsed that I couldn't even handle the dish sitting a couple feet away from me and had to ferry it to the kitchen immediately.  Ugh.
0;"""The most dishonest company.The ingredients on line is different than on the bottle.<br />This product has gluten ( Natural Flavor) in it which is not mentioned on line.<br />I am surprised that Amazon is so insensetive to this dishonesty.<br />I have ti throw away 12 bottles since not returnable.<br />Dishonest"
0;"""I have already written to complain about the packaging of these cans of nuts....have had no reply.<br />The cans were stacked 4 tall and completely covered with a very sticky tape.  When I tried to remove the tape"
0;Received this product in a box with no packing material.  All cans were bent and the product inside was all broken.  Why would they send cookies with out packing material?  Seems they were to busy to care!
0;The Health Candy Bars from Amason were just pass their use by date when I got them. I wonder if that is why they were discounted. It would be helpful to know before one buys a product if it is near or past the end of it used by date. it sure effects the value of the product. Amazon needs to fixed this.
0;"""this company uses boxes that leads you to believe you are getting a pound of pasta like other companies but you only get 13 some ounces. I noticed when opening up their boxes how little pasta is inside. I bought a whole bunch of this stuff"
0;"""I did NOT like the flavor of this compared to other brands we normally get from Japan (did not realize this was made in China when we purchased it). This was WAY too sweet - there is a lot of sugar in it. This product should be spicy/seaweedy"
0;Sent this to my son stationed in Korea for a fun B-day gift.  He said the candy must have been from the 70's cause it was so hard he couldn't chew it. He never complains about anything so I was very very disappointed
0;"""Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody. Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience.  Nausea"
0;"""Every tea in this box has some kind of bite or tang to it.  I am sure this tea is great for people who need organic tea and like to spend way too much on fancy products.  Consider sticking with Bigelow or even try Harney and Sons. They taste much better. This was not for me"
0;"""I put one square in my mouth and it made me want to vomit. I love most of their other products but this was absolutely volatile. The taste was stuck in my mouth for the rest of the night. Unless you like your chocolate very very very very very dark"
0;I guess you either love it or you don't. I recently read that Cafe Bustelo is a great dark roast coffee for espresso so I gave it a shot. It does not even have the aroma of coffee. To me it smelled and tasted like those stale packages of motel room coffee. It's back to Starbucks Italian Roast for me.
0;"""Eclipse is a rather lame sugarless gum and has a rather rubbery consistency.  I have chewed through several packs of different Eclipse flavors and this gum just doesn't do it for me.  The pieces are kind of small so I chew two at a time and the flavor lasts all of  five seconds leaving you with just this rubbery"
0;"""When I opened these bags they smelled so chemically I was scared to use them.  When I went to return them the widow was only 7 days verses the normal 30 days so I'm stuck with them.  Very dissapointed!  I also bought some from Blue Avacado"
0;"""I highly recommend that you do not purchase these sun dried tomatoes. I had previously only tried sun dried tomatoes that were packed in oil and I love those. I thought this seemed like a great deal since you get so many tomatoes for such a low price. Too good to be true. I knew these were going to be bad as soon as I opened the box. All the tomatoes are brown and black and obviously burned beyond recognition (I'll post a photo). They are so dry and tough that they are impossible to eat. I tried soaking them in oil and in hot water"

0;Item arrived and was completely enclosed in a packaged but the inside package was damaged. The original Voss box was torn as though it had been dropped. There were a couple of bottles leaking. bottles were placed in the box in all kinds of ways.I paid good money to receive this? I will not order from here again if this problem is not corrected.
0;Since when does Voss water come in plastic bottles. This company specifically does not mention they are plastic bottles and they are schemers. Theres no way these bottles are worth the price they are charging. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!
0;I didn't even get a chance to try this coconut milk thanks to the poor packaging of this item.  All eight cans are dented and damaged rendering them unusable.  I am extremely disappointed in Amazon.com for sending me damaged unusable un-returnable items.  Buyer Beware!
0;"""I should have read the reviews more carefully because I would not have ordered if I knew that even though a product arrives in unusable condition there is no recourse. I just spent $30.00 between product and shipping on something that had to be discarded. I wanted this product because it was so highly recommended by cooks. Instead of bundling these cans with shrink wrap so they stay in place"
0;"""Amazon sent this with one little airbag square floating on top like a silly decoration. So the crackers arrived smashed and in bits.<br /><br />In the same box were Triscuits and Wheat Thins. Those are sturdier crackers and they survived the bad packaging.<br /><br />I requested a replacement of the Better Cheddars"
0;"""I got this tea thinking it would be a nice tea reminiscent of the kind of hot cider drink you might get from a coffee shop.  What I got was a rather unpleasant experience.  When I first opened the box at work"
0;"""I bought this in the hopes of finding a replacement tea for my favorite Gingerbread Spice tea.  This was a huge disappointment.<br /><br />It tastes and smells really strange.  For lack of a better description"
0;"""This is one of the worst food products I have ever purchased.  I gave it one star only because it was not possible to give it no stars.  My dog wouldn't eat this crud. It did not even come close to the company's promise that  Every bite brings us back to those table overflowing with herbs at Velleron.   Unless the folks at Velleron use this as feed for their pigs"
0;"""Describing this material as  cranberry tea  seems unfortunate.  It is merely bitter black tea with a few shreds of something not definable. Perhaps I should have realized from the picture that it would have no cranberry flavor or scent and ordered the cranberry-apple instead.  I will return it to the company and they can compost it"
0;Tastes like a rancid dishrag pickled in brine.  No sign of spoilage - just bad tasting.  I bought based on the rave reviews of others here so I thought I'd chime in with my opinion.  I'm comparing this with the Fresh and Easy house brand - scarcely the premium - that costs less and is scrumptious.
0;Purchased 1 case and it only came with 1 dented can.  I ordered 3 more cases and half of them were dented.  They were very poorly packaged.  They were shrink wrapped in packs of 12 and packed in a box with some brown paper around it.  The boxes were much bigger that the shrink wrapped cans and they obviously shifted and moved around during transport.  have not purchased again and wont.
0;I cannot believe what can be charged for the amount that is in a box.  I ordered this item for a rather expensive Christmas gift for a friend and I'm now ashamed to give it as a gift as it is so sleazy.  I opened this box to what I hope was what I had in mind for $97.90.  You almost have to have a magnifying glass to see the items enclosed.  For this price it had better be the dang cheese in the nation.  Soooooooooooo disappointed and disgusted!!! 'Tis the season to be ripped off and RIPPED OFF I am!  Ouch - won't make this mistake again!!  Buyer beware!!!<br /><br />L. Stevenson
0;I was hoping to find something that was close to the licorice toffee that was made in England several years ago. The Oatfield Irish licorice was hard and difficult to eat unless I took it out of the wrapper and nuked it for a few seconds...what a pain to have to do when you want to enjoy a piece of candy...not worth the effort!!
0;"""This is the worst most God awful rot gut I've ever tasted.  I was trying to replace Royal brand dark choc pudding which they stopped making.  I order a case of this crap and it's horrible.  AND I discover it's a non returnable item.  Great.  Anyone want a case of free choc pudding that tastes like chalk?  Don't waste your money and don't order pudding on line if you are not sure you'll like it.  PLEASE ROYAL brand"
0;I have absolutely nothing against the product itself.  I have been buying the same container (4.5 lbs.) and brand for many years.  The only reason I gave it such a low rating is that this price is almost 2X what I pay for it.  At Sam's Club I get the same exact brand and size container for about $18.00.
0;"""I read a previous review that complimented this hazelnut flavored coffee as having just the right amount of flavor.  I could not disagree more.  From the first sip until I threw all 3 boxes away I could not tolerate the overwhelming hazelnut flavor and I love hazelnut.  I tried using one regular pod with one hazelnut but it was still intolerable. Live and learn I suppose"
0;"""I bought this because it seemed like it would be a healthy snack that tasted good.  I was hoping for it to be somewhat like a fruit rollup since I liked those as a kid.  I took one bite and I felt like I might as well have eaten the skin off an orange.  I threw the rest out.  Oh"
0;These are ironically too gritty. The texture is completely different than any other grit I've had. I was trying to find an organic grit as opposed to commercial brands but we couldn't even eat them....
0;I grew up eating merguez so it's easy for me to tell good from bad. These merguez were not the worst I ever had but close. Cooking them so much fat came out I had to empty the pan a couple of times. The fat was red meaning that they use artificial colorant which is not good either... I wouldn't recommend this product.
0;I love Arnold Plamer's and Starbucks has the best black tea & lemonade.  I was hooked on them all summer.  When I saw a bottled version of this beverage I was so excited.  Unfortunately this is not a tasty product at all.  I drank 1/2 bottle and had to dispose of the rest of it.  Not good at all.  Very disappointed!
0;Got the bag and the whole bag was smashed and melted into a brick. Why would they not wrapped it to protect it from getting smashed in the box and also package it to keep it cool. Complete waste of money I had to throw it away!!! Very disappointed in Amazon since they were the ones who sold it.
0;"""Multiple discrepancies between the product package and the company website make it impossible for me to know what the correct crude protein level and sodium content of this product are. Customer service was less than willing and able to  help. I made all my attempts to find this info before offering it to my cat"
0;"""This arrived as a single bag--ridiculous since it will never stay fresh and more importantly erroneous/misleading as the item description said  bags . Secondly it is repackaged so it's just a clear bag with licorice"
0;"""***UPDATE #2***<br />It seems that Amoretti has made a new flavor: Amoretti Premium Pumpkin PIE Syrup<br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0099AUJBW >Amoretti Premium Pumpkin Pie Syrup (750mL)</a><br />I haven't tried it but the reviews look promising. Read closely regarding sugar content if the taste is not initially to your liking.<br /><br />***UPDATE #1****<br />I still think that this syrup does not have any pumpkin flavor and it tastes exactly like cinnamon red hot candies but the customer service I received was the best I have experienced.  Within an hour of posting my review"
0;I was really excited about this product because pumpkin spice syrup is really hard to find in my area. It turns out that this stuff is waaaay to spicy for my throat. More than one pump leaves my throat burning.
0;"""My husband and I were so excited to try this! Packaging is awesome and I love the pump!  But the flavor is way too spicy and I don't taste pumpkin at all. I have to admit I was hoping for a Starbucks  pumpkin spice latte  taste so maybe my expectations were high but I am just really bummed that we can't even drink it at all. Packaging"
0;"""I wish I'd been more diligant about reading the other reviews before I ordered this.  It has NO pumpkin flavor what so ever!  None.  I truly does taste like cinnimon red hot candies.  And it's very strong in that flavor.  There is not hint of pumpkin taste at all.  I also ordered the Gingerbread Spice"
0;I really enjoy Starbucks' pumpkin spice lattes and wanted to try to recreate it at home.  I looked around the reviews and settled on this one since everyone gave it 5 stars.<br /><br />Know the candy hot tamales?  This syrup has the aftertaste of the candy's flavor profile.  More hot cinnamon than pumpkin flavor I'd say.<br /><br />Also the safety cap on mine didn't work --the ring below the cap did not break when I twisted it off so I have no guarantee it was not opened before...
0;It's disgusting!! No pumpkin flavor at all!! It tastes like red hot cinnamon candy but way too strong! It came and it looks great but when you taste it you will be disapointed!<br /><br />A rep. called me shortly after I posted this and was very helpful...great customer service!!
0;"""The best thing about Melissa's dried blueberries is the plastic bag it comes in which you can reseal.  The ingredients are whole blueberries and high fructose corn syrup.  A serving is 1/3 of a cup (2 servings per 3 oz package).  Each serving contains 22g of sugar and the total carbs are 34%.  That's a lot for 1/3 of a cup of blueberries.  They offer 2% vitamin A"
0;"""I usually don't write reviews much but I really felt that I need to for this particular tea. I absolutely dislike it and it smells quite bad. I thought I'd try to finish the package anyway but now that it's sitting in my office"
0;I love mango and peach so I was excited to try this tea.  When I first opened it and sniffed it smelled vaguely fruity but there was also an almost overwhelming plastic smell.  I tried brewing it to lighter and then stronger strengths but the taste was also plasticy.  I haven't tried many white teas so maybe they're just not for me but I know Lipton's Mango Peach is NOT.
0;"""I am writing this review from the hospital... A couple of weeks ago I ordered the  Whole Rabbit  from Amazon in hopes of having my wife cook it up nice and good.<br /><br />The problem started when I opened the box. Of course I had been wearing my 3 Wolf Moon T-shirt for about 3 weeks (Still had another week before it needed to be washed) and the pack was hungry. They proceeded to claw and bite at the Whole Rabbit. I was an innocent bystander as the wolves mauled at my own torso trying to get to that waskally wabbit torso I held in my hands.<br /><br />There was no way I wanted to give it up as my wife has a great recipe she found on Amazon. The ingredients"

0;"""I bought this for my kids since they wanted a bunny for Easter. I remember getting a bunny when I was their age. So I typed  Rabbit  into the search function here on Amazon and ordered this and opted for the optional gift wrapping. Imagine the look on the faces of little Jimmy and Suzie when they opened this up on Easter morning. They cried the whole day and it really made the Easter Egg hunt a downer. If you buy this product please understand that it is dead. It may have been alive when it was first packed but the box didn't have any holes in it."""
0;"""God knows why but my daughter Shirley ordered one of these rabbits without my permission. Before the rabbit arrived my Shirley was a healthy seven year old content with playing with her dolls and stuffed animals but then the rabbit arrived and well I must say it has changed her. When she took it out of the box I was quite shocked I told her if she wanted a living pet I could get her one from the local pet store"
0;"""The manufacturer of this innocuous looking animal has seen fit to hide a rather disgusting form of DRM in it without disclosing this fact to us paying customers.  I purchased this rabbit for my daughter"
0;"""I am shocked that Amazon would conspire in rabbit slaughter and their consumption by the public.  Rabbits are cute and furry.  They are the most popular pet in Baluchistan and parts of Vanuatu.  Many people have expressed their desire to marry rabbits"
0;Previous reviewers have stated that muffins prepared from this product are not too sweet.  I found the exact opposite.  I just tried using half a box combined with half oat flour and I am still getting a long lasting sugary aftertaste.  I won't be making any further muffins - they simply aren't to my taste at all.
0;"""I wish I had read the reviews before I ordered this product - there is something seriously wrong with their system.  The picture clearly shows a bag of 10 - but I received ONLY one Greenie.  I even paid extra to have 1 day delivery - only to receive ONE.<br /><br /> I'm returning for credit but will probably be charged return shipping"
0;I am very disappointed. I did not receive any sleepy time tea yet they sent me African Rooibos. I don't even like African Rooibos. The picture makes you believe you will receive a minimum of 7 cups of the 5 teas shown in the picture. Hopefully Amazon will rectify this.<br />I received the same as the person below me...I wish I would have read the below review prior to my purchase.<br /><br />NO SLEEPY TIME TEA<br />3 Celestial Seasonings Lemon Zinger<br />7 Bigelow Mint Medley<br />7 Twinings African Rooibos<br />8 Celestial Seasoning Mandarin Orange<br />9 Twinings Pure Camomille
0;My order arrived today (august 27th).  But the product has an expiration date of August 16th.  So it expired even before it was shipped.  Not good for raw beef.  At my local store the same product had a expiration date of spring of 2012.
0;I opened my box hoping for a great snack-to-go and what a dissappointment! It tastes like the fat is rancid in these. I opened another box to see if maybe I got a bad box but they were just as awful. My dog won't even eat them.
0;I bought these bars recently and was shocked at how bad they tasted! The outer breading tasted like play-doh. The filling was weird and sticky. I will not buy this product again. What a waste of money! It is bad enough I have to jump through hoops because of my gluten allergy! They should try to make these edible! They just cost too much to taste so bad. :(
0;I wish I had looked here before buying these. I got them in strawberry and was absolutely astounded with how horrible these taste. I spit out the first bite. They should try putting in more filling or something because it was the outside that tasted like sand and dirt. I suggest readers to find another option for breakfast...
0;"""Bought the apple version of these gluten-free bars at a local health store and was excited to try them as it's always a thrill to get your hands on any new GF product. Sadly my joy was premature! Tried one as soon as i got home and spit it into the trash"
0;"""What really is the most horrifying thing about these GOD AWFUL bars of nuclear waste isn't that someone would manufacture them it's that people wrote reviews stating that they liked them and they tasted good. These people should be identified"
0;This supplier made it sound like there were 10 packages in a box for over $13.  It was for one box of Pretz Salad that I can buy in the store for $3.19 per package.  I thought I was getting a case for $13-not one box!  Don't be fooled!!! I am returning this purchase!  This is a delicious product when you pay the right price for it.
0;I am very disappointed in the quality of these walnuts. They are pure sugar and have very little toffee flavor and the walnuts are all bits and pieces of left over walnuts.  I could not find 1 walnut halve in an entire package.
0;First I tried Nissan's regular rice but it ended up in my cat's litter box because it was full of weevils. So I figured try the parboiled rice since the boiling process should kill all the eggs. Wrong. Makes a decent but expensive cat litter.
0;"""This product came highly recommended by my friends and the vet so I decided to purchase a 30lb. bag for my 6 month old puppy. I fed it to her the first day I got it after inspecting the good 'til date and for any contamination. Within a few hours"
0;I have a one year old Labrador mix and I decided to give her premium dog food to better her over all health. She has been eating it for the past 5 days.... Every day she would have diarrhea and then the 5th day she actually started puking it up. I don't know if this is a recalled bag that amazon sent out by accident or what... But I can promise you that I will not be buying this EVER again. The only time my dog puked was after she had gotten fixed and was in the car for the ride home.
0;"""ive been reading about a salmonella recall with this product. my dog had complete watery diarreah with this... i had to throw away the majority of the 33 pound bag.<br /><br />i heard good things about natural balance before"
0;I got these for emergency food rations that will last for at least a year. I try at least one<br />can of the products that I purchase and I must say that this stuff is nasty!! It tastes like<br />the plastic lining in the can. Yea I'll eat it if I'm starving but not until then. Anyone else<br />even remotely like this stuff? I'd be glad to send it back or give it to my daughter for her<br />dogs.
0;"""This stuff is terrible! It tastes like a homemade fortified wine. We served it at a dinner party of ten and nobody liked it whatsoever...at all....not even a little bit. Thank God we had plenty of real wine and real alcohol to serve"
0;I got this because I wanted to try a few different LS flavors. I brewed this in a glass pot so there's no leeching but it still tasted like burnt plastic. Going back to Adagio Lapsang Souchong - it might be a bit weak but it also doesn't taste like burning electronics.
0;"""I like to consider myself a connoisseur in teas and this is by far one of the WORST blends I have ever had the misfortune to try. This blend tastes like an accumulation of old socks and sweaty feet. Lipton tea is leagues better than this garbage. I have tried the Earl Grey blend by Taylors of Harrogate and it was great"
0;"""I received this product and it was missing the lid.  Pretty disappointing considering how much of a crucial part of the trap it is...  All because someone can't even look at their own product and determine that  Ooops"
0;"""When I purchased this tea I discovered that the tea bags were not made out of paper. So I wrote the company and received this response:<br /><br /> Our tea infuser bags are made from food-grade nylon. Unfortunately"
0;"""Revolution makes a green Earl Grey tea but this item is mislabelled.<br /><br />This is a fine Green Tea but it is not Earl Grey.<br /><br />I ordered 6 so now I am stuck with something I did not want.<br /><br />This is the second time this has happened to me with Amazon.<br /><br />Another time I ordered what was described as  12 Packs of Coffee Filters<br /><br />with 40 each.  I received one and Amazon told me it was a misprint.<br /><br />No compensation was offered.<br /><br />Amazon needs a proof reader or needs to stand behind the descriptions<br /><br />of items they sell."""
0;you can buy lipton for less than 4.00 / 6 oz and 6oz at dollar generasl for 1.00. they dont have anything special. green tea is tea that hasn't been ferminted to make it taste bitter. green tea is great and cheap and so is tomatoe juice : )
0;"""chocolate is always delicious but in this case the pieces were way to hard.  The candy coating was to thick and it made them kinda hard to eat.  I was afraid that I would crack a tooth!  My husband seemed to enjoy them but he had a similar opinion on how hard they were.  I think they would be better without the candy shell on the outside and instead of a whole almond in the middle maybe some almond pieces.  Im not going to buy these again"
0;Agree with everyone who says that this is a bad product - has ruined many attempts at hummus and dressings - the taste is so strong it is overpowering - I had thought I was doing something wrong but reading these reviews I finally understand it's the Tahini and am now looking forward to having another go at my hummus recipes with a different tahini!
0;I just threw out a batch of hummus made with this tahini because it had an overwhelming bitter taste to it. Bitter in the same way that the motionsickness medicine Dramamine is bitter.  Will not buy this brand again.
0;"""I was really surprised how horrible this stuff smelled when I opened the can.  It is like a chemical not a food.  I'm a die hard hummus lover known to drive 3 hours round trip to get hummus.  My girlfriend and I made hummus with it and couldn't get the hummus tasting right.  I switched tahini brands to Kironos"
0;The Victor Out-o-sight mole trap does not work. I have been using three of them for about a month now and they do not work. The moles just dig around them. I followed all of the directions from this guy Jon in Oregon and have not caught one mole. Nothing catches moles. They are creatures from hell. Pardon me. But that is just the way it seems. I believe that this guy Jon from Oregon is nothing more than a pitch-man for these traps. It is NOT the fault of Amazon. They did their job. But the traps do not. Don't buy these traps.
0;Live in Florida and bought 4 of these traps based on the reviews here. This trap seems rather large for the size moles we have here in Florida. The tunnels which I could find are no bigger than 1 inch. The soil is so sandy that the trigger gets covered up and the tunnels collapse when trying to set this trap. I did as suggested and leveled the fist size mounds to see where the active tunnels were which showed up the next day. Not one trap went off.<br />As far as placing the trap with the trigger above the ground (as suggested by some reviewers here) this makes no sense as the tunnels are NOT RAISED and there is no way the trap will go off. The traps were placed with the trigger in the tunnel so the moles would go under it and trigger the trap.<br />Anyone living in a hot sandy soil area who has found a trap that will work please post.
0;I'm hesistant to give the product this low rating but it simply did not work for me. I tried on 3 separate occasions and actually saw the critter go past the trap and trigger it. Only thing I can figure is the trap is too large for my moles. I also followed the preferred method of setting these out. I plan to try again but the next time I'm going to be prepared to take care of this critter with a pitch fork if I'm lucky enough again for him to drive by while I'm laying the trap out!
0;I bought 2 of these traps and spent an hour trying to set one of them.  I have decided the trigger mechanism must have been installed wrong when it was made.  No way this thing will work.  Sent them back.  Will buy another type/brand.  Save your money.
0;"""We had mole tunnels throughout our lawn.  We first tried the non-lethal castor/garlic oil water spray method (twice).  It didn't work. Then we tried laying two of the Victor Out of Sight Mole Trap out.  That didn't work"
0;"""DISCOUNT???? Where is the discount here? I can get the 20 oz bottles for $1.29 in my local C-Town and sometimes they even have them for $.99 cents. Not even the larger sized bottles cost this much ($1.99). I am very disappointed in Amazon for selling this product at such a high price. Is it because it is the  Zero  type"
0;Fairly simple. Take a great product like Nutella. Package in convenient single servings (great for camping) and sell them. Ordered 2 boxes for a trip to Everest this Spring. Opened both boxes and discovered a mess - leaked packets everywhere. Don't waste your time or money. Better off buying a container from the store. I'm sure this not the first time this has happened.
0;"""I'm a fan of Japanese candies and snacks but this gum I would not recommend. It tastes like children's grape  flavored  cough medicine. I had to throw the entire pack out because people whom I shared it with had the same reaction. Try another flavor."""

It has been a few weeks"
0;"""I bought 10 bottles of Mystic mango carrot juice drink recently (the last two-three weeks) and the taste has completely changed. The wonderful flavor I grew accustomed to is no longer the same. The bottle shape has changed somewhat.  Has the flavor deliberately been changed as well? I hope this is not the case. It has a somewhat fishy taste to me now.  I hope I just bought a bad batch and that this is not how this wonderful juice drink I came to love to drink will now taste. A few weeks ago"

0;"""I finally decided to order a package deal knowing I could get stuffed sole (scallops and crabmeat) with steaks as well as various other things. Tried the steaks first and while I was disappointed with the size I do say they are way more properly portioned than what I usually get. They are quite thin and are okay at best but definitely not worth the money. Next we tried the potatoes au gratin and I liked that they were different than the sliced stuff in a casserole dish I remember having as a kid (never liked them before) but these were potato balls and while they looked really good they fell short of what I was expecting and my expectations were not that high. One of those deals where the first bite is pretty good and it just goes down hill from there ~ by the time I was done with the first one I didn't care to eat the second one. They seemed like processed frozen food rather than a gourmet type item.

I had one a while back  just to see  and while it seemed really bland it was so-so"
0;save your 5 bucks there is only like 10 pieces of gum and to be honest...there is really nothing special about this gum. You can get the same flavored gum in a store for 1$ It tastes EXACTLY like how Altoids would taste if they were in gum form. Its just a minty gum. There's nothing special about it. Sometimes you get a really strong stick that you cant breath and have to spit it out and sometimes you get a lame piece that tastes like minty chalk. I wouldn't recommend it.
0;"""It is really a very very BAD shopping experience!!!!!!!!<br />I bought many local flavor products as a gift for my friends.But after shipping i found that<br />Ridiculously expensive prices!!!

0;By far the worst bar I've ever tried in my life (I've probably tried over a hundred different varieties throughout my life). Tastes like bitter chalk. I took one bite and could barely stomach it. I don't know where all the 5 star ratings for this product come from. Maybe it's just me ....
0;"""A coworker brought a box of these into the office.  It ranks as one of the worst things I have ever put in my mouth -- and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />The first experience is not awful -- a pleasant crispiness to it"
0;This is by far the grossest thing I have ever tasted.  It tastes like dirt... just vile.  I can't even give them away because they are so awful. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  There should be a zero star rating option for items like this.
0;"""I would absolutely NOT recommend this product. The tub is extremely small and there is a huge crater on the bottom that takes up a good portion of the inside. Absolutely not worth the money. I have paid litterally less than three dollars for the same amount of licorice. Unfortunately I moved and none of the stores close to me sell it.

0;I just wrote this review for people who want to try this for the first time and are looking for peoples' opinions. I thought it would be much less sweet than it is. this stuff almost reminds me of chocolate syrup or frosting.
0;Very disappointing.  I have purchased this in the past from the First Colony website and it was very good.  The coffee in this purchase was very bitter and did not have any cinnamon flavor or cinnamon sticks mixed in with the beans as it had in the past .  We are throwing it all out.  A complete waste of money.  I would not purchase from White coffee again.

0;"""These Jordan almonds were horrible.  They were mushy and the coating was about half an inch thick.  It made you afraid to break your teeth if you tried eating one.  I ordered them to put in my cousins bridal shower favors"
0;"""Do not know what everyone is raving about concerning these almonds but the ones I received today and just returned back were horrible. They arrived cracked chipped and totally broken.

0;Apparently there is a very small market of us Seniors (76 yrs) who are into nostalgia...attempting to relive our youth at the penny-candy store. This collection seemed promising but perhaps has been in storeage since the 1940's. The candy is dried-out and stale. Familiar names and packaging provided some satisfaction...but at the price? Give me a break.
0;Don't waste your money. Not much candy and as best I could tell the wrapping for the individual candies were not retro.  I also purchased the 1950 retro candy and it basically contained the same candy as the 1940 retro candy.
0;I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased.  Pup chews on it a few minutes and<br />then it starts to thaw and you have a wet spot on carpet or in my case a puddle<br />in the middle of your couch or wood floor.  Not worth time or money.
0;This stuff suffers from the same issue that most sugar free products do....the artifical sweetner completely overpowers any other flavors and leaves a metallic taste in your mouth. Will not be buying this again.
0;I am thoroughly enjoying my ground flax. It is very flavorful and blends easily into smoothies and yogurt. I have added some to cereal and hot oatmeal as well. The price is great. A real bargain. Highly recommended.
0;"""Since all the good reviews here seem to be  Buzz Agents  I thought I'd add my non-buzz review.<br />These are terrible. The only resemblence to a bagel is the shape. They're basically like the heel end of a loaf of white bread with a hole cut out. The texture isn't chewy like a bagel should be (they obviously aren't boiled or steamed). Lame"
0;I received this item in poor condition.  It had leaves that were eaten up by bugs and the trunk seems to have some sort of rotting going on at the vase of one of the stalks.

I can only use Xylitol or Stevia as a sweetner.  Now that I have tried both I can only say DO NOT BUY this product if you want to sweeten anything.  It just does not work.  I  cannot give this away.  No one wants it.  Sorry but a review should be honest.
0;"""My second purchase of this product was unsatisfactory. This sweetener was  chrystalized  in small pieces and did not sweeten at all.  I called to complain and was sent a replacement to no avail. Same situation. The manufacturer must have a quality control problem. After these results "
0;Amazon needs to learn how to package their products better. One container of salt was broken and the white substances (salt) were all over the inside and outside the box and my freight forwarder have to call me and ask what is this white power... AMAZON PLEASE PACK IT BETTER NEXT TIME!!!
0;Don't be misled by the fact that the description says that this is a pack of 10...it is absolutely not.  It's only ONE packet...which you can buy at the grocery store for $1.00.  Don't pay four dollars for this item--you'll be shafted. Amazon gave me my  money back
0;"""I was hopeful this would work in my Keurig K-Cup Reusable filter.  It didn't.  I had coffee and coffee grounds everywhere!  Now I have yet another batch of coffee I can't use.  (I don't even know how it tastes.  I didn't want to clean up the mess"
0;I got this product from Amazon as it was on sale for a low price. I got the package and opened one. It smells really bad and you can not eat. They are selling it as it is still 2 months from expiry. Do not buy and eat this product. This is the second time it is happening with me on this identical product.
0;This product is made with high quality items and the expiration date is several months in the future. I opened one bag and it has an awful rancid smell and was non edible. I call Amazon and they took care of it immediately! I have ordered several grocery items on Amazon and they have been outstanding and great values. I love Amazon!
0;$22.10 for 12 lbs. of of oat bran?!<br />The company makes no special claim for their oat bran<br />other than to say it's different from wheat bran. Duh!<br />I buy oat bran in bulk at the health store for $.57 a pound.<br />That comes to $6.84 for 12 pounds.
0;#1: If you're someone who's always had Quaker Oatmeal...and you're looking for something more healthy... DO NOT buy this!...It tastes WAY too healthy to have any flavor...<br />I love nuts...but this is not as I expected at all.<br />I had it once and I had to throw out all the 6 packs that come in the box...none of my family members or friends liked it...What a WASTE!!!!!<br />#2: The plastic breaks WAY too easily!...I ended up with packages already opened in the box...leaking oats everywhere!<br />Conclusion: cheaper is not always better!
0;"""I remember enjoying campbells manhatten clam chowder when there were clams in it. This current soup had a few little flecks of clams and the rest was a thickened tomato base with mostly potatoes.Oh well"
0;They describe this product as 'Black Licorice Chewing Gum'. In fact it is a flavorless gum pellet with a bitter slightly licorice flavored candy coating. Two of these equals a single stick of ordinary gum.  VERY dissapointing!!
0;"""I was so taken with the commercial for this product that when I found I had a coupon for it I just had to buy it.  Now I'm sorry I did.  The shampoo totally stripped my hair.  I could have just used dish soap.  Yes"
0;This burned the heck out of my scalp. I couldnt rinse this out fast enough and it was STILL burning after rinsing. What the heck is in here. It doesn't lather as well either it's wayyyy to thick. It's LOADED with fragrances its one of the first ingrediants as is SLS and silicones which are bad for your hair. I'd totally skip this one. Also this has Zinc Pyrithione which is for dandruff and I think this might have helped cause the burning if you have NO dandruff then use this it has nothing to burn through so to speak. Anyway I'd def. skip this.
0;"""Used this 2 times first week of July.  Hair has been falling out profusely ever since.  My scalp is dry and itchy which has never been before. Am hoping this will end soon as I only used this twice..extremely traumatizing"
0;"""And thankfully I was on the tail end of the color cycle and almost time to schedule an appointment or I'd be seriously ticked. I've only used it twice and I'm practically back to my natural color and the gray is out in full force! The shampoo arrived in a padded envelope"
0;"""This was the WORST shampoo ever! I bought it b/c it was new and expensive and there were ads everywhere about it. I saw after like 2 uses ALL my hair was falling out in STRIPS. It was HORRIBLE. I cut my hair short thinking that it would get better and it just got worse. (I have black curly hair as long as down to my knees.)Now I barely have any hair"
0;At first I too loved this shampoo. After only 2 weeks (washing 3 times a week) my hair started falling out in huge amounts. I quit using it and after a month there seems to be less fall out. My once thick native hair is now weak and thin. My daughter also had the same results.
0;"""I bought this shampoo and conditioner after being lured in by the commercials. I was able to buy them at WalMart for a very cheap price($4.75 a piece). That is the ONLY positive thing I have to say about this shampoo and conditioner.<br />After using them I noticed that my hair looked a little funky(I color my hair"
0;"""Yuck!<br /><br />I have used the stevita stevia supreme packets in the past and they were great! So I assumed the liquid would be good too. There is a  motor oil  aftertaste with the liquid! Do NOT buy this as a sugar substitute."""
0;My first ever negative review:<br />I was excited to get this Jerky expecting it to be like the Jerky I used to buy at the corner store when I was a kid. I gave two bags to each of my sons and took the rest to work with me that night.<br />When The first thing I noticed when I opened a bag was a greasy smell and when I reached inside it felt like the jerky and bag were covered in a layer of Crisco.  I could have guessed the taste
0;"""I received yeast and  Sorbitan Monostearate  I did NOT order  sorbitan Monostearate  I ordered just  YEAST <br /><br />I waited ten days for chemicals? A person who bakes their own bread wants the best! This is garbage.<br /><br />To return this item I must pay out of my own pocket to ship it back for their mistake. What a rip off. This same yeast at my grocery store does not have the extra ingredient. I am very disappointed and feel they have stolen from me."""
0;"""We ordered Hooter Wing Sauce for a party.  The packsge arrived the day of the party.  When we opened the box we had recieved Chipolte Salad Dressing.

0;"""I grew up eating Velveeta shells and cheese.  It was always something my mom had in the panty and now I frequently buy because it tastes great and is a quick side dish.  I accidentally purchased this 2% milk 1/2 fat variety and was immediately repulsed.  I wholeheartedly disagree with the other reviewers who claim you  can't taste the difference.   Well"
0;"""DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT AN AUTHENTIC WASABI TASTE! The ingredients on the amazon site lists: Horseradish and mustard. For those of you who care about preservatives and anything artificial this definitely is not your product. Here is a list of the ingredients: Horseradish"
0;I ordered 3 jars of this calorie free Alfredo sauce thinking it would be good like Walden Farms other products such as the chocolate sauce.  I was very disappointed as the sauce has a very strange taste to it.  I will give the other 2 jars to my daughter in hopes that she might like it.
0;"""I tried these from a local grocery.  Sugar and rice flour are the<br />first two ingredients listed on the box and it shows in the taste--<br />I like chocolate and these taste way too sugary.  So if you would<br />rather have more sugar than chocolate"
0;"""I am very sorry to say this tasted to me the way I imagine  rear end  would taste. I tried refrigerating them to make it more palatable. For some reason there was a very strong bran-like taste as the most dominant flavor"
0;From the picture on the package I assumed that the chocolate came in small pieces.  Instead it seems to be a huge hunk.  I cannot use it for the purpose it was purchased and I am not allowed to return it according to Amazon's policy.  The packages have never been opened and sit on a shelf in the kitchen.
0;There is no water at all in the regular Coconut milk and its the same price in the stores. Save your money and buy the<br />regular and add your own water! You will have watery coconut milk and it will be a lot cheaper!
0;"""The ad-wizards at Nutro not only raised the price on their dog food but also dropped the amount in the bags by 5 pounds.

0;I know this is supposed to be frappe mix so it is going to be sweet but it was way too sugary and it smelled and tasted like an old sweater. I was really looking forward to making green tea frappes at home but I'm just going to throw this stuff out because it is so disgusting to me.
0;"""Now why would the description say it's a great alternative to milk when it contains milk by products!?! Annoying! Now I have to waste time returning it.<br />Update: This company was extremely difficult to deal with. They argued with me about it containing milk when it says right on the ingredient list that it contains a  milk derivative . When I refused to pay for return shipping they claimed to not know how to give me a shipping label. Their email responses did not even make sense much of the time"
0;I just ordered the 5lbs bag date of receival is 8/28/09 and its expiration is 11/5/09. I did not order an expensive product just to get something thats almost expired. Very disappointed and would NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY FROM THIS SELLER anymore!!!
0;I have Celiac Disease and heard so much good stuff about Hemp Seeds.  I purchased this 3lb. bag and was excited to try it.  The first time I became very nauseous and I did not connect it to the Hemp Seeds.  The next time I sprinkled it on my salad.  Approximately two hours later I got horrible stomach cramps and uncontrollable vomiting.  It was so awful!  I was in pain the whole night.  I was afraid to eat anything the next day.  I just had Gatorade and a banana.  I don't think I could ever try Hemp Seeds again.  I don't know if this was a bad batch or if they share equipment with a wheat facility. I will never buy this again.
0;"""This hemp seed made me and my family extremely ill.<br /><br />I ordered the 3 lb bag. I do not know if this was a fluke or just a bad batch but this was TERRIBLE<br /><br />I received the product in great time. It arrived in about 3 or 4 days and i gave half of the bag to my daughter. I used hemp seed mostly in my protein shakes. I've been taking hemp seed for about 4 months now. When I got this product"

0;"""In an attempt to get away from high caffeine energy drinks a tried the free trial of FRS energy.  For 5 bucks they sent be a a two week supply of the orange concentrate and a two week supply of the lemon lime powder.  The lemon lime powder was by far the worst of the two.  As some of the other reviewers have already explained"
0;I bought 4 11.5oz cans of this on sale for 50 cents each.  It has worst taste of any energy drink I've had kind of more like a carrot taste rather than orange maybe carrot and cauliflower mixed with aspirin with a hint of robitussen. Not sure if it had any effect at all: went right to sleep after drinking it.
0;"""I looked for a natural energy drink (the managing weight was a bonus) and found this. I tried it. It does not mix well with water. I tried warm water at first and then chilled it and there was still clumps. The flavor of the berry makes it hard to swallow. I cannot describe the taste"
0;"""Recieved the product and tried it in regular bottled water. It is absolutely the most god awful tasting thing there is. Have no idea what kind of lemon lime flavor this is supposed to be. Could not even get half of it down"

0;We bought this right before Christmas for my daughter who is 4 who has Celiac.  I must say that they were the worst gluten free cookie we have ever made.  There are some out there there are much better these were very chalk like and brittle and they left a terrible after taste! Definitely not a good buy!
0;These were disgusting. I can't even describe the odd taste they had - like no nut or seed I've ever eaten.  Waste of money. I threw the whole lot of them away.  Wish I'd read these reviews BEFORE I bought them in bulk!
0;Thank god amazon gave me my money back and I ordered some other Earl Grey Tea which I received today and it is great!  This tea tastes like it is old or something.  Do not buy this tea!!  Rated One star because they won't let me rate it no stars.
0;"""I used to buy Apple and Eve juice boxes all the time until I discovered most of their apple juice comes from China (and apple juice is even in this  grape  product). I don't feel safe giving my children food products from China given the country's track record with food safety."""
0;I was very surprised to open the box and find only a letter from the USDA explaining they can't allow citrus leaves or lemongrass entry.  This is probably because I live in California where we grow citrus and don't want any imported pests (we have enough pests of our own already :-).<br /><br />Note that the post mark on this was Thailand.<br /><br />The seller should have know this and not sold to me.<br /><br />I guess it is OK if you live in some other state.
0;"""I've ordered these on 6 different occasions and each time there are at least 4 bags that break open when you put them in hot water.  You end up eating your tea!  I keep giving it a chance because I love the taste.  I even went to our local tea house to have it and half of the time I have to keep going back to return it because it opens up!  I plan to try to contact the company today to let them know"
0;I ordered this item as a Christmas gift but was disappointed when I received it. It is a sample set of everything which is little. I do not recommend unless thai is what you are looking for. I will not be ordering food sets online again.
0;"""I didn't like the smell of the candy when I opened up its wrapping. I checked then the label to realize that it was made in China. I wanted to give the candy box as treasurer box rewards for my kids' school"
0;"""One of the flavor memories of my 1960s childhood that evinces the least nostalgia is that of stale orange  tonic  (as we called it in New England) bought from the local Bradlees or Ferretti's discount super markets. The only more heinous flavor was grape soda -- a chemical brew so noxious that it burned going down (we thought this was normal) and left an acid-stripped sheen on the teeth.<br /><br />But now"
0;They are exactly as titled. But the company was terrible about sending them! They were ordered/paid for a Christmas present in around October and still had not come before Christmas and when called they still took there time sending them and didn't even apologize. I think in all it took 3 months to get.
0;"""It was a beauty when I received it but slowly but surely it started to lose all its leaves and eventually died. I'm good with these plants but to no avail. It looks great in the picture with the little pond and all but whether you keep this plant indoors at any temperature"
0;"""Looks comatose on arrival.  Within two days had white cocoons on most of the remaining leaves.  Never had a chance.  I will also say that it was the first product I ever returned to Amazon and their process for doing so is world class.  Easy"
0;BEWARE!! you are getting a good deal on these because the cans are dented and the contents taste metallic. they cant's sell these damaged products in whole foods so they sell them to you on amazon. blech!! disgusting!! tastes like the nickels and pennies you are saving when you shouldve just gone to the store to get your coconut juice
0;"""I love VitaCoco and ONE coconut water (especial Vita Coco's pomeg. and acai one...tastes like a less sugary sprite with a hint of berry).<br /><br />This stuff was TERRIBLE.  Each 8 oz. has 31 calories more (so altogether this can has over 150 calories where vitacoco has 90.  WAY too sweet"
0;"""First off these  gummi  apples don't have the gummi consistancy that haribo's other gummi candies have. They were so soft that they were like eating gum drops instead of a gummi product. I know what you are thinking"
0;I wish I can give this a 0 star. I'm a tea lover who drinks tea everyday and this tea is by far the worst tea I have ever had. I thought I would give it a try to something new. Bummer! I brewed one and the smell reminded me of nasty cold syrup medicine. I could not stand the weird smell at all. Now I'm left with 19 teabags. It will probably just be stuck in my cabinet or I will throw it away.
0;Funky taste and it smells as nasty as it tastes. I agree with previous poster the blueberry acai is way better than this. I ordered a whole case and after the first box can't bring myself to have anymore. I tried mixing it with other flavors but it still had that nasty smell & taste.
0;"""I ordered the variety packs but instead received just chocolate and vanilla.  I honestly don't know if they made a mistake or ran out of the variety and sent me the chocolate and vanilla instead. But one thing is fore sure"
0;The lemon meringe pudding is awful.  Tastes very plastic and like what it's made of - hydrogenated soybean oil.  Very big disappointment - BLUCK!!  Love the vanilla flavor - so don't know what happened with this flavor.
0;"""I bought this recently for my 2 yr old who needs to drink rice milk.  Needless to say it was a waste of money.  It took me almost 30 mins to mix it with my hand mixer to get it into a drinkable constistancy.  Otherwise it was very"
0;This rice milk powder was terrible.  2 of the canisters arrived damaged and spilled all over the package.  It simply doesn't mix well leaving clumps everywhere which no amount of mixing seems to help.  Might be better if use a blender.  I bought this for long-term storage (similar to those who buy milk powder) so guess I'll pray I never have to use it.
0;"""I cannot drink coffee (too acidic) and have been loving  Java Mate  (yerba mate and roasted ramon nut).  Thought I would give this beverage a try...can not even finish a cup of it-too much fig (raisin like) flavor!"""
0;Two of the six packages had been cut open and the contents spilled all over the inside of the shipping box.  It made quite a mess as the quinoa is small and scattered all over the floor.  I have been reluctant to use the remaining packages.
0;"""Had used onion herb in past....and was excited to finally find it.  My markets in area did not stock it.  But what a disappointment .....nothing like the original.  And unfortunately had to buy six..... What a waste of product....will end up tossing.... No onion flavor but strong on pepper flavor"
0;This seller should be expelled from amazon.com. This was a wedding aniversary surprise to my wife aNd was absolutley DISAPOINTING. The roses were tiny. They come in a box as do it your self kit. All the mood was ruined by this vendor. ThIngs like this damage amazon.com's reputation of screening vendors that publish in their site.<br /><br />Payed more that 100 bucks for these and the a lot worst than flowers that you buy in the street.<br /><br />DONT ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR. DO NOT TROW YOUR MONEY TO THE TRASH!!!!<br /><br />Detailed prictures of the products will be uploaded for you to judge.
0;I was shocked to read the ingredients of this and other Hostess products.  Can anyone explain why they put beef fat in these products?  I think it's disgusting - I've never seen such a thing and I'll never buy any Hostess products again.
0;"""WARNING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT! I sent this email to KRAFT and ACME STORES where I purshased EASYMAC.<br />I purchased your EASYMAC microwavable mac&cheese dinner.<br />The package was in the microwave oven for 2.5 minutes and the plastic<br />container melted and started to burn in the microwave.<br />Had I not acted quickly my house may have burned down.<br />This is very serious"
0;My 16 year old son made this product while I was not home. After 90 seconds the container started on fire. The microwave is burned and my son may have have been injured as the item continued to burn. He used an oven glove to remove it from the microwave and throw in kitchen sink. I am lucky to not be visiting my son in a burn unit now. If you value your home and children do not use this product. I reported this to Kraft who is claiming this is not a safety issue.If it has happened to you report it to Kraft so this dangerous item is removed from the shelves.

The sauce is like concentrated super salty soy sauce with wierd playdough noodle Couldn't taste anything but the soy sauce. If you're tempted to try them"
0;These are made in china...not a good idea at all considering all the food saftey issues of late.  also i feel that it is wrong to buy food/agricultural products from another country (a politically hostile one at that) when our own poor farmers are having such a rough time making ends meet because all their work has been outsourced to these unsafe chinese farms.  there are many much safer and ethically sound alternatives to these snacks.
0;I bought these because I could not find ANY teething biscuits anywhere around here. I was hoping they would do the same job but they don't come anywhere close to Gerber's product.  My daughter is six months old and although she likes them she bites off pieces with her teeth and I'm afraid that she'll choke. They don't dissolve quickly enough and were a waste of my money.
0;My son is 6 months old and I was so happy to find this product. I thought it would be like farley's rusks but it's more like a wafer. I tried it before giving it to him. It does not melt in the mouth on contact. This 'rusk' can easily break or be squished by a 6 month old. Thinking that my baby will have a better experience I gave it to him and he was biting on it like a teether and a small piece broke in his mouth. I quickly took it out as I could see that it was a hard piece and it failed to melt in the mouth on contact. I will return this so called rusk and get Farley's rusks instead.
0;I enjoy grilling and making the related side dishes like baked beans etc. I am guilty of using at least 2 or 3 bottles of liquid smoke each month. After finding this product on Amazon I thought I would give it try. I have used several products from Colorado Spice and they have been good. This product was clumpy and does not sprinkle like a pinch of salt or anything else. If you try to rub onto or into meat it turns to a sticky paste which sticks well to your hands but not the meat. The smell is strong hickory and so is the taste (to strong or maybe the paste is too thick) I am back to liquid smoke. After 40 years of cooking it is still the only item that consistantly works.
0;"""not only did I receive 4 flavors instead of the one that I ordered*just like the other reviewer* I couldn't use the vodka/cream flavor....the others were all diluted...lacking punch and flavor...<br />I added spices"

The shipment number is 2012OCT08"

It looked like someone just swept the floor and put it into a bag.<br />I decided that may be (just may be) I do not understand something and tried it anyway. Who knows the looks could be deceiving. I did not like the taste. It was not as disgusting as the look of the tea"
0;"""Boy was this a mistake!  Ordered two bottles of this stuff.  It's not as dry as the wasabi one normally gets in a sushi place.  Guess they had to add more vinegar to get it to squirt out the ultra cheap  bottle .  In truth"

0;This only gets one star because it won't let me rate it as zero. DO NOT buy this to use on your pet! I decided I would use it for a couple of days between when I noticed my cat had mites and when the vet could fit her in. I only used it once and I'm glad that was it! The vet said that he has seen animals die from using it. She's now on prescriptions to knock out the infection caused by it irritating her ears. Don't take the risk!

0;I actually tasted this item from a friend before and decided to order my own. Bad idea. It was disgusting! It tasted like it was mixed with chemicals or something. I had one bite and threw the rest in the garbage. I was highly disappointed and upset. Not worth my money at all. I wish I would've returned it for my money back quite honestly.
0;I asked for a refund because this product tasted stale and gummy. I understand with the ingredients that during shipping temperatures can affect the product some but this was way to chewy and felt a bit like wet cardboard. I wont order it again.
0;My order arrived late and the cookies were not fresh.  They were very stale.  I regret placing the order and definitely will not order from them again.  I don't recommend purchasing these cookies.  Find them where you live locally.
0;My cats love these treats and they are getting hard to find in the store. However the price is way too high. I paid over $4 for each of these and I can buy them at WalMart for $2.93 when they are in stock. I am very disappointed because I thought I was buying a 10 pak and not a single bottle at that price. I won't buy them again through Petco. My cats will have to adjust to something else that is sold at a more reasonable price.

0;I tried other flavors of this product and liked it.  But this jalapeno is utterly disgusting.  There's a faint fishy flavor.  I don't know how they did it because there's no fish in it.  The BBQ flavor is much better.
0;First off let me state Amazon and the retailer did nothing wrong. The problem I had is with the product itself. Even tho it was well within it's expiration date when I opened it it was obviously stale and nasty to eat.

0;We were using nestle lactogen for my son in India. Herein us we brought Gerber as an alternative. As we feed him he starts omitting. I tasted ut and ut tastes bad.<br />Giving negative rating just because its not alternative for nestle lactogen. Do consider nutrition while buying.
0;"""RECONSIDER THIS FORMULA!!<br /><br />Martek advertises this formula on their website! Nestle owns Gerber now<br /><br /> Although Martek told the board that they would discontinue the use of the controversial neurotoxic solvent n-hexane for DHA/ARA processing"

Kukicha is THE reason I started to drink tea.<br /><br />If you're looking for traditional GREEN Japanese kukicha - this is NOT the tea that you want.  It doesn't even taste like green kukicha.<br /><br />I made the mistake of thinking the pictured example was just a bad photo.  I had been under the impression that kukicha was always green by definition"
0;"""I bought one of these to use in a small pen to train piglets to electric fence before putting them out to pasture.

0;"""Read this article from NBC Nightly News about arsenic in organic sweeteners like brown rice syrup (one of the main ingredients in this product) and you might think twice about purchasing these cereal bars.  My daughter had been eating them regularly as a snack...not anymore.<br /><br /> High levels of arsenic"
0;I asked a Seattle's Best Customer Service Rep what level matches the 6th Avenue Bistro and they said 4 or 5. It does NOT  taste the same. Very disappointed they discontinued it. If you find another coffee that has the same rich european taste please let me know!
0;"""I was looking for a healty snack and these got good reviews. My first impression was that these are very small and extremely bland tasting. The almonds were slightly soft and did not thaste very much like almonds"
0;"""I just can't believe all the positive reviews on this product.  Every company should get one free pass for making a mind-numbing mistake and putting out an absolutely horrible product.  For the folks at M&M"
0;I purchased a case of these in October 0f 2011 which has an expiration date of August 2012. I opened the case today and found they were all full of worms. This product has no shelf life so I urge you to avoid purchases in quantities for use at future date. The manufactures web site has no clearly defined path to resolve the issue so I will call them tomorrow and update this post.
0;The product discription promised 120 packs of gum I only recievd 10 packs. That's 120 pieces instaed of the described 1440 pieces. $31.38 for 10 packs of gum? I want the rest sent immediately!<br />Julianne Fiore
0;The order I received did not match the description at all. I only received 10 packs of gum and not the 120 that was advertised. I'd give this 0 stars if I could. Oh and it doesn't allow returns either.
0;These bars are high in sugar and hard as a rock and they are made in China!  So who knows what is really in them!  Why doesn't Amazon disclose the country of origin?  Why doesn't the company disclose country of origin on their website?  Shame on Mrs Mays.
0;"""We purchased these Wolfgang Puck Coffee pods because Amazon has had Senseo pods out of stock for quite awhile.  We love our Senseo coffee maker but it's difficult to find the pods anywhere else (except from Senseo and they cost quite a bit more than the ones we purchased from Amazon).  We tried these Wolfgang coffee pucks but they're too thick to put 2 pods in at a time.  They come packaged one to an envelope and although we understand that the reason there is to make them seem  fresher  but it's a pain to have to cut up each envelope - not to mention a waste of paper.  The pods only produced about a 1/3 of a cup so we had to wait for the first one to finish brewing and then insert a new pod to make almost a full 8 ounces of coffee.  Even though the Senseo pods were packaged with a lot more pods into one package"
0;"""Crap. These pods are too small for the double cup and too big for the single cup. Plus the filter seems to be made from some kind of industrial grade kryptonite mesh that water can't actually seep through"

0;"""The description should indicate that this is mostly given as a CHRISTMAS basket. When my grandmother received it she was under the impression that it was the wrong basket or that I was gypped because I mailed this as a Mother's Day gift. She said it looked like a Christmas gift because of the Christmas mugs that were included. I had no idea that Christmas looking mugs were included. If I had known"
0;"""My 9 month old is sprouting 6 teeth and I thought this would be great for him to hold and chew on (like a chew toy). The first time we gave him one was to keep him occupied while we were out having dinner"
0;These biscuits easily break into large chunks and can choke your baby.  I just handed one to my 8 month old and it broke when he took it from my hand.  Thinking that was a fluke I handed him another one and he chomped off a huge piece that I had to sweep out of his mouth.  Don't buy these!
0;"""My son almost choked to death on one of these. Instead of slowly dissolving they break apart in large chunks. I would pull them out of his mouth whenever one broke off but today he managed to swallow it before I could get it out and it was nearly lethal. The biscuits are wide and flat. The pieces that break off have sharp corners. The piece that he swallowed was completely blocking his windpipe and because of the sharp corners it was nearly impossible to get out. Baby heimlich did not work. I had to stick two fingers all the way down his throat"
0;"""My daughter is 10 months old and she almost choked yesterday when trying these cookies. She had been chewing for less than five minutes when a big piece broke and got stuck in her palate. We were able to retrieve it but it was scary and VERY dangerous. The first box I got at Whole Foods contained several cookies that had broken into pieces"
0;"""We purchased these for our teething 6 month old.  She really enjoyed it for about a minute before a piece broke off and she started choking on it.  We had to flip her upside down and pat her on her back to dislodge it from her throat.  The title of teething biscuits is a bit misleading"
0;"""This is the frst time I bought this biscuit for my 9.5 mo baby. The biscuit is hard n it broke off to smaller pieces inside her mouth but it didnt melt like those Gerber food. My baby's face then turned red.. She almost choked but luckily she swallowed it I guess but it scared me ..I wont but this again"
0;Other 1* or 2* reviews are correct.  This products is a choking hazard itself.<br /><br />These biscuits shouldn't even be given to babies.  My nephew is 9 months old and according to the description should be able to try these biscuits.  He is starting to grab stuff and eat more solid foods.<br /><br />My nephew had one and the biscuit broke off.  Lucky he was able to cough it out himself.  NOT recommended for babies.<br /><br />I don't understand why it would even be approved to be on the market for babies.  It's more like an adult biscuit.
0;"""I tried this for the first time today with my 8.5 month old grandson and within one minute a piece about the size of a half dollar broke off in his mouth and became lodged in his throat.  He started turning off color and couldn't breath.  I lifted him out of his high chair hoping that might dislodge the piece but it did not.  I then tried the modified heimlich for babies twice and it didn't work.  Finally"

0;Could easily find this in the Wash DC area about ten years ago and loved it.  Since moving to California in 2002 have been unable to find it.  Contacted local distributors and got no explanation why.  Have since learned Canada Dry seems to be playing games with the availability of their diet cranberry ginger ale.  Seems odd a product so popular and in high demand would intentionally be kept from public.  What's the reason Canada Dry?
0;"""Open the packet and you see the tea is dark green then the aroma of alfalfa wafts by and you know this isn't even close to being good Matcha. It is everything  even class 2 Matcha isn't. It's not lovely to look at"
0;This product tasted like chalk and there wasn't the slightest sour taste to it.  I called the distributor who received my payment and they said that I would have to take it up with the candy manufacturer.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned the product was terrible and the service lousy to say the least
0;"""I purchased Virgin Coco De Manila brand coconut oil and I noticed a marked aftertaste in the product.. and I do not like it at all (after using another brand). We use the coconut oil in everything cooking"
0;I love TollHouse crackers so I wanted to give these a try.  They were the worse combo cracker<br />s I've ever tasted.  They were burned on one side and gave left a bad after taste.  All 4 boxes went in the trash. What a waste.
0;I was searching for k-cups on Amazon.  This came up in my search.  Price seemed good and it was not clear that it wasn't k-cups.  now stuck with 3 boxes.  Not worth return charge.  Please do a better job in your search process.

0;"""I was very disappointed with the artificial flavoring in teas in the multi pack. Definately not something that would be found in nature.  I emailed the company for the ingredients in the  natural flavoring  and they stated that would not be able to disclose the ingredients for natural flavoring.  Natural is too broad and perhaps something that would be undesireable or an allergin."""
0;Opened only one box of cereal and it was stale. Not fresh like in stores. Was actually looking for the vanilla cookie crisp without the sprinkles and was excited to order. I'm extremely disappointed that someone would sale STALE Cereal. Not worth the $ that I paid. Now I have 3 unopened boxes of stale cereal that I can't do anything with. Go to your local grocer to get quality cereal. Lesson learned for me.
0;Disappointed big time.  The flavor lasts a very short time and if you leave the pack in the car (out of the sun and still wrapped) you will be very disappointed with the outcome.  Gum crumbles.  Main compliant though is the flavor lasts only a short time.

YUM!  Every kids dream"
0;"""I am a Crystal Light peach tea fan so I was anxious to try this. My gold standard is Snapple diet peach.  Crystal light relatively closely approximates that.<br /><br />It seemed like Mio it would be convenient to use.<br /><br />First I had trouble with the packaging.  It was hard to appropriately tear the plastic cover off.  I also had trouble with the directions.  I am 49 and my near vision is going the way most people in their 40s goes... I can't read the directions without finding reading glasses.  Could the manufacturers possibly consider their over-40 customers valuable and print just a little bigger?!<br /><br />My first squirt of the liquid went past the glass.  Ok.  So that will only happen once but..  Although mixing crystal light powder doesn't bother me and I am sure this is a liquid version of something similar"
0;I absolutely love peach tea. My favorite is diet peach by Snapple so I was very excited to try the MIO Luiquid Peach Tea but I did not like the product at all.<br /><br />I usually drink 4-6 16oz bottles of water each day so I thought the compact size of the MIO would be good to keep in my purse for when I wanted a change to my routine. The size and convenience was the only positive of this product.<br /><br />The directions specify 1 squirt per 8oz. The first time I tried the product with a 16oz water bottle I gave the flavoring two healthy squirts and the result tasted like cough medicine. Blech! I poured water out and watered that disaster down and managed to finish the rest of the water.<br /><br />On my next try I started out with a teeny tiny squirt and worked my way up to a decent flavoring but it still had a bad aftertaste that just didn't work for my tastes. I'll stick to plain old water or Snapple when I need a peachy fix.
0;This stuff tastes so nasty I wanted to gag. The aftertaste is hard to get rid of. I am not a diet soda drinker but this reminded me of the aftertaste from diet drinks. I tried mouthwash and brushed my teeth but it still lingered and made my tongue feel raw and my teeth gritty like it was taking  the enamel off.
0;"""The bottle tells you to dispense one squeeze to flavor 8 fl oz of water. Exactly how much is  one squeeze  supposed to be? One family member's squeeze colored his whole glass of water orange and gave his water a sticky sweet aftertaste"
0;"""I like water but sometimes I need a little bit of flavor diversity.  I tend to turn to Crystal Light or my water infuser to vary my drink selection.  I was excited to try the MIO Liquid.  MIO seemed like an easy way to make a beverage that had the perfect amount of flavoring.  Unfortunately"

0;"""I'm surprised to read the other reviews for this product...I was soooo excited to find my favorite Honey Nut Clusters on Amazon after searching for so long in the grocery stores where I live. I could not contain my excitement the day I knew that they would be delivered!  I got home to find 3 beautiful boxes with that memorable little squirrel smiling at me... I had to have a bowl immediately!! As I poured the clusters into my bowl...I thought to myself  hmmmm...this doesn't look quite right   I procedeed with faith that it had just been so long since I had seen the cereal.  As I took my first bite I knew it was too good to be true...  THESE ARE NOT THE HONEY NUT CLUSTERS I KNOW AND LOVE!!   I continued to eat hoping that I was imagining it or that it would just take a few bites to set in.  But alas...Honey Nut Clusters truly do not exist anymore.  This cereal is more like Honey OAT Clusters I do not see NUT Clusters.  I even checked the other 2 boxes to insure that the first one was not just a bad batch.  So to all those Cluster lovers out there...I am sorry...but the end is here :-( RIP Original Honey Nut Clusters!!! You will be missed!!  As for those of you in search of the next best thing...Let me introduce you to Honey Graham Oh!s and you can get them at a grocery store near you!"""
0;$1500 later......please learn from my experience and DO NOT buy these Himalayan Yak chews for your small dog.  I have a 14lb Shih Tzu who is a chewer and we were turned on to this product by our local high-end dog retailer (Mud Bay).  While the packaging does have some warning about when the chew gets small.....I have to say it's near impossible to babysit your dog's chewing.  A piece of this company's yak bone did in fact get caught in my dog's esophagus and we incurred some SIGNIFICANT bills to retrieve the item through endoscopy.  Not to mention all the pain and suffering my dog went through all because of a product he's supposed to chew on/eat.  It's just not worth it.  The chews in the package are smallish and you'll have to end up throwing nearly 1/2 of it away because it will become a choke hazard for your dog.  WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!  I hope my review helps you steer clear of this product!
0;I ordered this chocolate as a Mother's Day gift and when they arrived they were dried out and discolored. I believe they had melted at some point. Not exactly what you want your Mom to get on her special day. At least Amazon customer service was great and issued a full refund.
0;I am not a big chocolate fan. I bought this because it was dark chocolate. All three varieties of assortment taste horrible. I never ate a cardboard but I think cardboard might taste better than this. I tried few pieces of Hershley's bliss dark chocolate and it is much better than this product.
0;"""I guess I need to chalk this one up to buyer beware.<br /><br />I was pretty upset when these steaks arrived at what was an unsafe handling temperature.<br /><br />I had no idea how long they had been in this state"
0;I bought these for my daughter who drinks decaf due to her heart condition.  14 of the 35 were not even decaf. Very disapointed with the product.  35 k cup loose in a box.  Can't even return them! I usually read reviews but for some reason I didn't think you should have a problem with buying tea.  I was wrong!!  VERY WRONG!!
0;"""I love coconut water.  Hands down my favorite drink.  I thought this would be a great idea because it's less expensive and more convenient than buying a young coconut and draining the water out.  It is both of these"
0;I had coconut water (at least that's what I thought it was) some years back while in the Bahamas.  I don't recall it tasting like this.  This was so bad I couldn't even swallow down one pack. I will try to add some pineapple juice to one of the eleven containers remaining to see if it makes a difference.  Wow.
0;I've had coconut water and this is just plain nasty! Plus it's mixed with other fruits and instead of tasting good it taste horrible. I know the name and label are appealing. I don't recommend this product to anyone not even my mother-in-law.
0;"""I first tasted this product at the grocery store.  I bought the 33oz. container and loved it.  Unfortunately the taset of the ONE coconut water from Amazon was horrible.  IT had a strange taste as if it had been left out in the heat - it was a rancid flavor.  I will not be ordering this again"
0;"""Let me say I have been drinking ONE coconut water since it first came to market and I loved it. I noticed my last shipment had a funny taste.  I checked the shipping carton and found that ONE has started getting its coconut water from the Phillipines.  Big mistake.  It's awful. The only way you'd know this is if you buy it by the case.  ONE doesn't identify the source country on individual Tetra Paks. Anyone who started with ONE in the beginning knows they used only Brazilian coconuts as their source.  The original stuff was crisp"
0;"""O.N.E is not telling the TRUTH ! ! ! The box tells the LEGAL TRUTH OF WHAT IS IN THIS PRODUCT [ CANE SUGAR ] If you are a diabetic this is not good for you - AMAZON TOLD ME TO POST THE LABEL ON THE SHIPPING BOX - see above - ALSO IF YOU READ THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION YOU WILL FIND THIS:  no added sugars"
0;I suffered through an order of this stuff before I wised up and switched to another brand.  This coconut water has a really off taste - sour or spoiled.  It definitely did not taste like the coconut water I was accustomed to.  I switched to Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water.  What a difference!  Save your money and spare your taste buds and skip this product.
0;"""I love O.N.E. the most of all Coconut Water. What got me really upset was that Amazon sent me a shipment on March 2011 that had a sell date of May 2011 and got recalled on April 2011. The recall was on all shipments with a sell date of  May XX"
0;Man I don't know what everybody is talking about but this stuff is sooo nasty. I bought some for my grand daughter took one large drink and thought I was going to threw up. I thought it must be me and my grand daughter didn't like it either. I was so excited on all the hipe I should have listen to other reviews. Whoever is writing other reviews must work or selling the product. No way they tasted this product.
0;This drink is horrible. I tried to drink it but I didn't even make it half way through the container. The coconut water tastes like some really watered down milk. I thought maybe i was an acquired taste but in all honest truth it is just nasty. I would not recommend this to anyone.
0;I have been ordering these on subscribe and save for several months now.  This last shipment included a box of 12 that is bad but I can't find anywhere to report it and secure a replacement.  This is a major flaw in using subscribe and save and in ordering food items here.
0;I wouldn't know how this product tastes as none of the cans were safe enough to try. One of the cans in particular was so squished I'm surprised the box wasn't covered in orange goo. Every single one had dents. I saw another review saying the same and thought maybe that's a fluke or  it's been a while and the problem is fixed so I'll give it a try... it's really too bad.
0;"""this seemed like one of the more higher end dog food since it cost twice as much as the dog food I got the first time I got my shelter dog.. She's a terrier mix (my vet tells me terriers are picky with food? I'm not entirely sure being a first-time dog owner)"
0;The coffee is terrible as it has absolutely no flavor that comes close to the intended flavor. After trying two cups to give to make sure the first cup was not a fluke I threw away the remaining K-Cups.
0;My biggest gripe is... What moron taste tested this and put it on the market?  It smells like raw sewage.  I tried to sip it to see if It only smelled bad.  I could not handle drinking it.  Maybe if I had a clothes pin on my nose.  Hmmm...  I'm trying to think of a friend of mine that doesn't have a very good sense of smell.  Maybe they would like it.  I had two sips and down the drain it went.
0;I pre-ordered these because I love Kahlua and there were some good (non-Amazon) reviews on the web touting the partnership between Timothy's and Kahlua on this new product offering.  These are the worst k-cups I've ever purchased.  They have a decidedly burned smell as they are brewing and they taste even worse.  A big disappointment to say the least......
0;I purchased the Timothy's Kahlua coffee to serve to family. I tried it as soon as I got the delivery and to my surprise it was really bad.  I couldn't even drink the stuff and the lingering taste was absolutely horrible.  It had a very chemically taste and was bitter.  I ended up throwing it all away and was a waste of anticipation and money in ordering this k-cup. Don't make the same mistake as I did.
0;"""This is by far the worst coffee we have ever had.  We have been using our Keurig machine for over two years and have tried many different coffees.  One thing we have learned is that you really have to take flavored coffees with a grain of salt as you sometimes have to search your palate for the advertised flavors.  That being said"
0;"""This is most definitely the worst K-Cup I have ever tasted.  I have had the pleasure of tasting the majority of K-Cup varieties and this by far the worst!!!!  It smells horrible and tastes even worse.  The best way to describe the odor is the burnt aroma that would come from a coffee pot that was left on a burner until all you could smell was the charred remains.  Since when does Burnt = Kahlua?  After brewing this in my office"
0;"""Ok I read the other reviews and said  How bad can it be?  Let me tell you it smells like a wet dog that got sprayed by a skunk when it is brewing. As you drink it every once and a while you get that odor. It doesn't taste half bad (no Kahlua flavor though more Hazelnutty).<br /><br />I can't make this at home the house stinks for hours and my dog won't go in the kitchen after I brew it. I took it to work and put it on the table in the kitchen area where free stuff disappears fast. I can't give this coffee away.<br /><br />It's a shame I had high hopes for this flavor. Believe the other reviews"
0;This coffee tastes and smells repulsive. I like the flavor of Kahlua and I love coffe. I love the international creamers Kahlua creamer. I thought this would be an obvious win. I brewed a cup and the smell was HORRENDOUS! I drank a couple of sips and almost threw up! It doesn't taste like Kahlua or coffee! DO NOT BUY THIS! YOU ARE WARNED! IT IS BAD!!!!
0;I bought a single one of these locally to try out and thank GOD I only bought one!<br />After I hit the brew button I walked over to the fridge to get the creme and as soon as I opened the door the stench hit me. I swear I thought something was rotting in my fridge but it was actually this swill brewing on the counter. I was horrified. Some people described it as a burnt smell and it certainly has that going for it but there's so much more. It's unbelievable. The taste isn't as bad as the smell but it's so overwhelming that you just can't get past it.<br /><br />Clearly a LOT of people like this coffee and I would suggest trying one before you buy the case. You will be very angry to find out you're one of those people that thinks this smells worse than a spent diaper.
0;We have been using K=Cups for our Keurig for years now. This is the first time we have gotten a box where all the k-cups are defective. The tops apparently aren't on right because every cup gets coffee grounds in it.<br /><br />Horrible!
0;I did not like the Kahlua coffee at all it smelled bad and had a taste that did not appeal to me at all..unfortunatly it was a waste of my money I have a full box and 3/4 left of the other one.  I would like to say I like Timothy coffees this one is the only so far I didn't like.
0;"""I'm no coffee expert by any means. I do however have a sense of smell and taste unfortunately for me after wasting money on a 24-count pack of this. It smells disgusting- I had to open the window after brewing it.  Skunky is about right. The taste- not quite as bad"
0;"""DO NOT ORDER.  I recently received this order and the K-Cups have a defective seal that blows liquid out of the side all over my counter.  I do not have this issue with more expensive store bought K-Cups"
0;"""I ordered this for my mom because she has always loved a little Kahlua in her coffee and I thought this would make her very happy.  I couldn't believe the stink!!  I went outside with a pot and and a spoon clanking all around the house trying to drive off the skunk that was on a spray-fest - the odor was that strong and awful.  It burned our eyes and noses"
0;Would love to give zero! My dog loved this rawhide but during 2012 everything changes. Ring is now half the size and it looks very cheap. What a disappointment from one of dogs favorites that I bought all the time to a cheap replacement that I will never buy again.  Not sure I would even trust this brand ever again.
0;"""Maybe they were better 3-4 years ago but today in 2012 they have gone down hill. Cracker Jacks have always been my favorite and as far as I know I'm the only person I've met that eats them. I went to try the 7Oz bag because I'm used to the little boxes and never had a big bag. Well let me tell you if you see a big bag just skip it alright. In this giant bag there were on 3! YES! I counted them! 3 Peanuts in the entire bag!  Carmel coated popcorn & 3 Peanuts!  is what the bag should say. One"
0;This is one of the worst tasting cereals I've ever had in my life. After eating this cereal I went online to see what other people thought. I found people on Youtube reviewing this cereal and loving it. They must be paid actors as part of a viral video scheme because this cereal was terrible. There was hardly any chocolate inside these things unlike the pictures on the box and the texture of the cereal is not good at all.
0;"""Kellogg's Krave cereal tastes like chemicals to me. It contains ingredients which are patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab by inserting foreign genes into their DNA and made them resistant to massive amounts of RoundUp. The sugar in Krave comes from GMO sugar beet"
0;"""These just taste awful! Not at all like an authentic chai tea. They are very chemical tasting almost like faux sweetener. I despise aspartame sweetener and this tastes exactly like that except I don't know what is actually in the k cups as I don't recall there being ingredients on the box? If you like fake sweeteners"
0;I did not like the taste of this at all.  It was awful.  I think the Tazo Chai Tea concentrate heated up with milk makes a much better chai latte.  I did want to try this one based on the high reviews and the fact that it would be easy in the keurig to make this drink.  It was NOT good.  I'm going to try my best to give these away.
0;I was so looking forward to receiving this product. Unfortunately I hated it. I ended up throwing it all out. It seemed slimy like very cheap ice cream. The only good thing about it was it was still frozen when it arrived in Michigan.
0;I have a german shepherd puppy and even he is not interested in this toy. We tried rolling it around for him and he was not amused. he ate the treats that fell out (like 10 at a time) and then left it where it was. Buyer Beware. It would be better if it was actually soft plastic but its hard and uncomfortable to play with for him. 1/2 star!
0;"""I am sitting here watching my dog completely sound asleep after a $600 emergency vet visit.  We did as instructed with this toy last night and sat with our Pit/Mastif 17month old puppy named Daisy.  She loved it and today we went out for two hours to look at homes to buy.  When we returned she did her usual running around and greeting us with her new toy in her mouth.  Several minutes later she was laying at our feet with her toy still there.  While reaching out to grab the toy and play with her it was stuck.  I mean stuck.  She had literally gotten her entire lower jaw stuck in the hole that you take in and out to place the food into.  Not a tooth not a hair"
0;"""I was in the same room with my schnauzer when he suddenly went nuts and there was blood everywhere!  the middle insert came out and he got his teeth caught in the cube trying to get to the food.  NOT SAFE!  he was hitting everything in his path and it took a few minutes to calm him enough to lower his head and get his teeth out of it.  We won't use THAT again EVER<br /><br />It is also VERY difficult to put the food into"
0;"""My dog loves interactive toys and it seems its the only way I can get her to actually eat her meals.  I bought this thing (mini size) with high hopes but once I got it in its done nothing but disappoint.  First of all I think I may have a defective product since there is absolutely no way I can get the middle cylinder out.  I looked this up online and it seems numerous others are having this problem.  Therefore strike 1: can't clean the thing which I can see getting gunky real fast.  Fine I can't remove the cylinder"
0;"""We had one of these cubes for 3 years for our English Springer Spaniel. He loved it. One day he got his canine tooth stuck in the round insert. He immediately began howling in pain.  He was howling so loudly while my husband and I safely detached it. I have never heard my dog cry this way before"
0;The carton of 24 arrived completely melted.  I guess it was stored in an non-air conditioned environment in transit.  The company should mark the product as perishable.  It was awful!  Never again unless it is below freezing weather.
0;"""Bulk Prunes about $17.00. Shipping about $17.00 (about 5 pounds). There were seeds and splinters of seeds in this product. For $34.00 I bought 6 pounds of Prunes from Sam's Club for less than $30.00. Bilk Prunes was not a great value"
0;HOW COULD A COMPANY WHO PRAISES THEMSELVES ON BEING A NATURAL VERY HEALTHY DIET????<br />THIS CONTAINS EVERY INGREDIANT THAT HAS PROVED TO BE SO BAD FOR OUR DOGS! CORN? ITS JUST A FILLER! AND A MAJOR ALLERGEN SAME WITH THE WHEAT AND SOY ETC ETC EVERY ARTICLE YOU READ SAYS ALL THOSE INGREDIANTS ARE VERY UNHEALTHY FOR YOUR DOG! TISK TISK SHAME ON WYSONG! I WOULDNT USE IT IF IT WAS GIVEN TO ME FREE! ITS RIGHT UP THERE WITH PROPLAN PURINA ONE AND BENEFUL THEY ARE RATED THE WORST ON EVERY REVIEW BOARD IN ALL THE BOOKS AND ON THE NET!

IT WILL BE THE BEST MONEY SPENT. IT WILL EXPLAIN THINGS MUCH BETTER THEN I !!<br />I BOUGHT IT FROM AMAZON.COM
0;"""... only I could be assured that it would arrive undamaged. I only gave this product one star because of the packing during shipment. The product itself gets four stars from me. I have used this oil before and I really love it. But I ordered twice and both times I couldn't use the oil because the cans were so severely bent-in. Can't changes be made in how these cans are packed for shipment? Surely they aren't stocked in such horrible condition! The two little air pillows placed on top of the cans did nothing to keep them from banging into each other during shipping. Does anyone listen to the complaints that are posted? Does anyone care? On the chance that someone is listening"
0;"""I received 3 months of Ice Cream from this Club as a gift. I was very disappointed with the Ice Cream I received and the giver was unhappy after seeing the choices I was sent each month. The first 2 months included a duplication of black walnut"
0;"""Two bites because the first bite was so horrible I couldn't believe anything could really be that bad.<br /><br />How a reputable company can put its name to a product like this defies credulity.  Dinty Moore Beef Stew is bad but edible as a last resort to avoid starvation"
0;"""I keep getting Amazon emails with these coins listed - presumably because I was recently searching for Chocolate Gold Coins to use in my wedding. The problem I have is that the title blatantly states that these coins are  Only $0.09 Each!  which is a blatant lie no matter how you swing it. Let's do the math"
0;"""This bread is great. I'm ordering it for a year and love it. Sometimes it comes little broken... usually in the summer... but most of the time it is fine. I love this small package better cause it fits better in the toaster. I love that it go bad in you do not fridge it.one can see the whole grains and it tastes very good with cheese...salad... guacamole..etc<br /><br />Editing my review....cause i broke 2 teeth cause the stones in the bread. When I broke 1 tooth - ok"
0;"""Each time I eat this I get what feels like when you swallow a pill the wrong way and you feel like it's stuck in your throat.  I don't know why.  It doesn't happen to me any other time.  I like their apple chips and enjoy those"
0;The picture has mangoes in squares and the two times I ordered the mangoes they were in whole pieces. When I asked to know what happened they wouldn't or couldn't tell me and I don't think I am going to order food from Amazon ever again.
0;Save your money - I wish I had...everything about this product is a disappointment. Who knew macadamias and coconut (two of my favorite things) could taste so bad...can I return seventeen and three quarters of the eighteen that I purchased...? Please?
0;The improvement in availability of real licorice has been encouraging but unfortunately the quality is suffering. Corn syrup and gelatine are the primary ingredients so I am giving up on licorice purchased in this country.
0;"""I try to buy this flowers for my mother .<br />The site says  order it in the next 4 minutes if you want to ensure the delivery by may 29. <br />It was two days earlier than the real date I was interested"

0;"""I guess my title says it all.<br /><br />Price has gone up 30% plus in the past three months. I have got my old coffee maker back out for when there is more than one of us having coffee. At over 50 cents a cup"
0;Gloria Jean's cute brand name makes weak coffee. When I go to a gas station or a quick-stop my coffee choice is usually Hazelnut flavor and then I'll kick it up with some Hazelnut flavor creamers. So I happen to like Hazelnut flavored coffee and I drink it often. When I saw the chance to get some for home it looked like a good idea. Idea may have been good but the Gloria Jean Hazelnut flavored coffee fell flat on my taste buds. The best I could give it is 'adequate' since the gas station on my way to work has stuff much better for a fair price. I will use the Gloria Jean stuff up then forget about it because I don't want to be bothered sending it back. Live and learn and take the bad with the good to let an educated perception be my guide.

0;Will not ship to FPO AP address! So frustrating being a military spouse additcted to my Keurig. I have to find a place that will ship me the K cups or my $299 coffe maker is useless for the next 3 years.
0;I am totally disappointed. My order was for 96 k cups of Gloria Jean Hazelnut. I just opened the box and to my surprise I only received two 24 count boxes. When will I receive the other the next 48 kcups?
0;I ordered decaf hazelnut k-cups from Gloria Jean (that's what I clicked on) what came in the mail was non-decaf (regular) I cannot drink regular coffee. I was dismayed to see they were not returnable. If it were not for Amazon's wonderful policy (they refunded me anyway!) I would be stuck with coffee I could not use. This is why I order 90% of my online purchases from Amazon. I will go back to Paul Newman decaf k-cups. They arrive as ordered.
0;"""See all the negative reviews for this product for the 12 oz. size. Amazon has kindly agreed to suspend sales of the product as the problems are too numerous. The items are arriving with disgusting green mold all over the treats. Despite repeated promises by the manufacturer that they have repaired the  manufacturing glitch  no positive action has been taken. Also people are reporting trouble getting reimbursement from the manufacturer for items they return (which the manufacturer will not pay for the return shipping). I wish I could attach photos as you would never believe how truly disgusting is the condition of these treats. These pose a health risk to your dog and I STRONGLY urge you not to buy."""
0;The worst mayonnaise I ever tried. I don't know why they call this mayonnaise extra heavy. It is so thin that it runs off the spoon. Store brand is 10 times thicker than this brand. It does not even taste like mayonnaise. I threw out the entire half-gallon of this awful mayo with the garbage.
0;"""I ordered two boxes of the Treats For Troopers Snack Package on April 13 to arrive for my Soldier's 20th birthday on May 13. As of May 15 it hasn't arrived and I'm a little disappointed that his birthday has come and gone without his little  party in a box . As soon as I receive word that it has arrived I can post a better review. It's what he told me they most enjoy receiving while deployed in Iraq for themselves. Boxes of little toy animals is what they enjoy getting to give away to the kids.<br /><br />Well it's almost Christmas and the boxes never did arrive to my soldier. I'm out the money and even though the supplier assured me that they had sent it it never arrived. I asked my son if others were having difficulty in getting their mail and he said they were not. All I can assume is that after two attempts"
0;Overpriced and no actual confirmation that it ever reached a member of our troops.  I have since used the USPS shoebox sized box with a small fixed rate to send to troops.  A lot cheaper and able to choose better ingredients.
0;When my husband was told to restrict his sodium intake I bought Tony's salt free seasoning.  We like the way it flavors foods but we have both found there is something in it that causes us to sneeze and cough whenever we use it.  I have asthma and have had to use my quick relief inhaler several times when I used the product.  My husband is not asthamtic but it did cause him to sneeze and cough.  I don't what might cause this reaction but it happened more than once so I don't believe it was just a coincidence .
0;I ordered 4 boxes of 8 nutri grain bars and amazon only shipped 2. I contacted customer support and was told that they would credit the order amount as a one time exception. I am livid. Amazon screwed this up and in order for me to SAVE THEM MONEY I do not ask for the item to be reshipped. IT would cost them 8-12 dolllars to ship this ONLY BECAUSE AMAZON SCREWED UP. I told them to cancel the order and not reship and they are doing me a favor??<br />THIS is a exception with the exception should be DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM YOU WILL BE SHORTED 2 boxes.
0;Its too bad that they cant just use natural ingredients in something so simple.<br />You can get the same bars with natural ingredients at trader joes or whole foods for much less.<br />Hopefulyy Kelloggs gets with the program in the near future.
0;"""Bought the beef and chicken Not for me....First off while the price is 64% off be aware that it'a industrial size....and it expires in June....I bought 4 of each the chicken and beef...HATE the taste....and THEY really should tell toy the expiration date...Probably why it's so cheap....I THREW them all out....just did not like the taste or consistency!<br /><br />Manna Soy Gourmet Meatless Grilled Chicken"
0;Ordered these for relative in another state.  Every can arrived severely dented.  We are both worried about food safety issues because of the dented conditions.  This is NOT the quality we normally associate with Amazon PRIME.
0;I received a case of the gourmet early june peas and was appalled when I opened the sealed case. EVERY single can was dented and unusable. I had to chuck the entire case out. I'm assuming the warehouse just dumped all their unusable cans in a case and shipped them out.
0;I just had the worst case of food poisoning that I can remember.  I used it to flavor some greens at dinner. My husband did not eat the greens and I was only one who got very ill. Beware of refrigerating this once it has been opened.
0;I am sure this is completely my fault.  I did not realize that organic meant they would be brown (silly me I thought the package was green  like the top and that was why the picture made them look brown).  These taste more like raisins than the dried apricots I am used to.  I have been trying to like them and I like most organic things I have tried but this product makes me realize why preservatives are used.  I am going back to the pretty orange ones that taste like apricots because these taste spoiled to me.  It may be an acquired taste...
0;"""My review is 'don't bother.'<br /><br />I put this on my wish list after seeing it on (I think) the 'Cool Tools' website. I wish I would have read Joseph Rukaj's review so I would not have received the 'almost right' size as I prefer the Trader Joe's PB. Regardless"
0;The Witmer company website offers 2 models and various combinations of lid width and jar height. I also had to return the Amazon item because I have Trader Joe jars. I have just ordered from Witmer directly.
0;I am sure it would work well if we used peanut butter that it would fit on. I didn't see different sizes offered on the Amazon web site and just ordered...my mistake. I have no idea if it is a good product or not. Susie
0;I bought this product along with Dr. McDougall's Tortilla Soup and Dr. McDougall's Hot & Dr. McDougall's Curry with Brown & Wild Rice Pilaf and I must say that I waste my money behind Dr. McDougall's products. All three products I bought taste very awful and worst food I have ever ate so far. I have never experienced this kind of bad taste in my life. Now I going to throw out all 15 cups. if McDougall can give me money back I for sure return all my items.
0;"""I was so excited to find this product.  I have used the beef and chicken.  Both have very nice flavor but can be too salty if you use too much.  My main reason for buying these was because they were suppose to be MSG free.  Silly me"
0;I read all the positive reviews and was very confident when I got this 15 pound bag for my cats. Big mistake! Both of them started having wicked diarrhea the next morning. I figured they need a few days to adjust. Three days and about 30 clean-ups all over the house later we went back to overpriced Science Diet and lived happily ever after.
0;I love using sumac in my salads and the quality of this product is very poor.  I think it must have been an expired product because it had no scent to it and to get any flavor I had to use 5 times as much.  Will not buy from again.
0;While I didn't expect this to be nearly as good as the real thing.....I did expect it to somewhat resemble potatoes. Someone had to work really hard to make something that tastes this nasty!!! Absolutely awful!!!!
0;"""I have tried several delicious gluten-free cookie mixes and this was by far the worst. I knew something was funny about this mix when I was adding the ingredients. The dough smelled exactly like Play-doh. The dough was extremely sticky and wouldn't come off my hands when I tried to mix the dough manually. After baking"
0;"""We have been gluten free for about 4 years now and this is the first I've tried this product (I usually make everything from scratch or use my go-to premade mix: Pamela's).  This is the worst cookie mix I have ever tasted.  When I first bit into the cookie I would have sworn there was a bean flour in the ingredients"
0;"""I make pumpkin spice lattes at home and wanted a quick shortcut.  Don't make my mistake. This has a terrible after taste and smells horrible. I will continue to make my pumpkin spice lattes the old fashioned way"
0;We got a box of this cereal with high hopes.  It doesn't have a very good flavor or texture.  My kids won't even touch it.  They each tried a handful and all of them disliked the flavor.  Doesn't taste like chocolate at all.  I'll stick with Special K Chocolate delights over this.
0;What a disappointment this was.  For $25 I was expecting a nice sized basket.  It arrived and I just could not believe I spent all that money on such a small bucket.  I had to run out and buy more gifts as I was too embarassed to give this as the main present.  Not to mention the picture is very deceiving.  It shows more items than you actually receive.  What I recieved was worth only $10 at best.  I could have done better making it myself at the Dollar Store!  Lesson learned.....
0;I wanted to try a different brand of rosehip tea and purchased this item. What a disappointment. There is no taste or aroma. The packaging is nice but that's about it. I sifted thru some of the product it seems like they used the outer shell of rosehipfruit. I am asking for a refund.
0;I used to get this on the Amazon Prime Subscribe and Save deal [ 3 boxes for 6.58 delivered free ]  we used to have 18 boxes delivered every month - Until amazon stopped this on the subscribe and save deal -  so now i drive up to local walmart and get THE LARGER 21.5 OZ BOX FOR 3.50 EACH ... and get 10 boxes every time we need it .......
0;The supplier should be ashamed for doing business this way.  As of yet I have had no response from my e-mails and no product.  This company should be banned from doing business with you.  Is there anything that can be done?
0;"""The package label looks different than this one but it says Mount Sterling Goat Milk Feta Greek Style. I USED TO buy lots of it because I loved it. It was nice and crumbly for salads and omelets and a bunch of other recipes. Flavoful with a long shelf life.<br />NOT ANY MORE.<br />I was surprised when I opened a package to crumble it into my salad and it wasn't crumbly. No different than any sliceable cheese. I figured it just a labeling mistake and returned it to the store. A while later"
0;These chocolates were for my nephews pirate themed party. We put them in the giveaway bags and when the kids opened them up they had obviously been sitting along time as the chocolate had turned white and stale. Gross.
0;I did not get the package.?<br />It was delivered Sept 30th at 10.ooam.<br />I also did not get another packaage from a different store<br />delivered same day and time.<br />U.S.P.S said it was left in the hallway.?.I live in a Condominion0<br />Where you have to be buzzzed in.<br />Wendy Wood Carter
0;Big disappointment both in flavor and appearance. Too many pieces were shriveled and mottled with unsightly shell residue. Cashews tasted stale which is not surprising given the flimsey packaging -- secured only with a twistie instead of being vacuumed sealed. Will not buy again.
0;I had bought the white powdered cheese (3 bags Land O'Lakes) before and the orange cheese from Barry Farm.<br /><br />My Kids loved both.<br /><br />This was cheaper and I am so used to free shipping from Amazon I went with this for a cheaper per ounce total cost.<br /><br />We used one packet and the kids refuse to eat any more.<br /><br />Buy the white or the orange.
0;The item arrived open! The bag the item came in was cute and planned on using it for storage! There was leaking product all over the bag! Everything was half gone! I only got half of usable merch outta this! The soap leaves a residue!
0;All of the regular drink mixes contain sucralose aka splenda and other artificial sweeteners. It gives them an aftertaste i would expect from a diet soda. Not to mention health concerns and they advertise no high fructose corn syrup like its healthier.
0;"""Item came damaged one or more of the soda mix  leaked out messing up the box it came in also the others... throw-ed the rest away after contacting the sell and he said he will resend the item to me...<br />After a week passed and i still didn't receive the item he told me it was post out and should arrive in 2 days time"
0;"""Nasty Nasty Nasty. I threw them out. They're horrible-tasting. I have nothing good to say about them. So now I'm stuck with a very expensive carbonated water maker. My water is much better without the carbonation. By far"
0;"""I received my order promptly and as promised yesterday.  My order included a hotair popcorn maker as well as a 4 pound container of Snappy Yellow Popcorn.  I was so excited when I received my order that I quickly opened the box and popped up my first big bowl of popcorn and boy was that a disappointment.  The new popcorn maker worked perfectly but the Snappy popcorn is stale.  I don't normally like to complain but the product was pretty bad.  On a good note"
0;"""Product arrived quick and as exactly described on amazon.  Only problem is that its stale.  This popcorn must be at least two decades old...space popcorn from the Kennedy era.  I was warned...another person has commented on the stale popcorn"
0;This product was very strange. It says it is a plant root but why the fish smell? It was extremely difficult to chew through so some went down my throat whole. If you wake up at 1am feeling nauseous don't be surprised. I did not like this product.
0;I had great hopes for these noodles. I prepared the noodles as directed on the package.  I thought these would be great with spaghetti sauce.  Was I ever wrong! They were so slimy I gagged. I won't try them again.  The other 4 packages are to be thrown out. A miracle noodle it isn't.
0;"""Learned after eating these I have a food intolerance to the konju root/glucomannan.<br />Purchased to help lose weight.  Got opposite affect.  Major water retention throughout<br />my whole body.  After several months of eating noodles"
0;This was a great product right up until she decided she couldn't stand them anymore. My other cat does not like them either and refuses to eat them and she will eat anything! I have used both the chicken and salmon flavors and am now getting a cat who turns up her nose at them.<br /><br />I am beginning to wonder if they have changed their formula recently because these were a godsend for a year.
0;I wasted my money today on these lousy treats that do nothing and are over priced. I paid 6$ and change for something my cat spit the pill out of and my other cat won't even touch. I can buy treats for 2$ so why did I just pay 5$ extra? Thanks for nothing Greenies. What a bunch of garbage.
0;I have been going crazy looking for the traditional candies from my youth and was excited to find this.  There is a very thin fine line of chocolate with no taste of it.  I had to actually look at the candy to see if there was chocolate in it.  Very disappointed.  Definitely not the chocolate filled straws I remember.
0;"""I purchased this product from a local store.  Cooked it according to directions -- and before ten minutes was up 85% of it had broken up into kibbled pieces the size of rice grains -- yet still uncooked. Just awful.<br /><br />I've been gluten-free for 12 years"
0;"""Be aware that the image shown is not the true product you will receive. The product I received is the new blend  from the makers of Maxwell House . The new blend tastes a lot differently from the original blend. I ordered the product from Amazon.com because it gave the impression they had the original blend.

0;"""The pop came very fast but I was extremely disappointed to find that this flavor was very odd and tasted nothing like raspberries. The pop was far too carbonated as well. This was far more carbonated than what we buy in the store. I would of asked for a full refund or exchange but decided against it as I do not believe it is covered under Amazon's policy. Not anything like the others we have tried (Almost all of them"
0;"""Maybe I got a bad batch? This stuff doesn't even remotely smell like soy OR vanilla. It's so unappealing that I can't even bring myself to mix some up and try it - and usually soy protein powder is a pretty standard product that tastes pretty good (to me"

0;"""How long has Nestle been using artificial sweeteners in their hot chocolate?<br />Swiss Miss used to have a big note on the front of their box that said  No artificial sweeteners.  Which made me read the ingredients of Nestle. I was shocked!<br />I always preferred the taste of Swiss Miss over Nestle"
0;We are a family who love our bottled sodas so I must say I've been disappointed with the selections we've had lately. I know many sodas are mass bottled but it seems while they are high on carbonation they don't taste much like the flavor on the label.  That is what we had with this item.  Where was the green apple flavor?  Did I get a bad batch?  Not satisfied at all
0;"""How disappointing to find that these Consul Escargots (in a somewhat European looking package) are actually a Product of Indonesia... I hadn't even questioned they'd be from anywhere other than France as I've never seen any escargots that weren't. Live and learn.<br /><br />Amazon really needs to disclose country of origin on their products"
0;I ordered the Mulling spices as pictured.  What I received was the Spiced Cider mix as described.  I paid extra to have a case of it sent overnight mail.  I am very disappointed.  Apparently the ad department got the wrong ad with the picture and what I saw was not what I got.  I'm sending it back but who knows if I will get a refund and I'm probably definitely out the $22 overnight fee which seems wrong since it's their fault. BE AWARE!
0;I ordered the Wrigley Spearmint Heritage Collectible Chewing Gum Tin and received 40 packs of wrigley spearmint gum which is not what I ordered!!!! I am very disappointed that I didn't receive what I thought I ordered!! NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER!!! I'm scared to return the gum because I'm afraid that I will not get my refund!!! Ver disappointed!!!!
0;I recently purchased this item on behalf of my sister. She has several chemical alergies. This item is packaged in a plastic bottle that is supposed to be  smell and chemical free. I believe it isn't the agave  tasted and smelled just like plastic. Should package in a smell free container.
0;"""Thought I'd try it since I order chicken korma when dining out at Indian restaurants - was quite disappointed as this jar sauce tasted nothing like anything I've ever had - tried adding butter and cream and ground pistachio"
0;"""I love truffle oil and have been using different brands for a few years now. Some are better than others but this stuff is a total rip-off. There was NO flavor of truffles at all. The front of the bottle says Porcini Mushrooms & Truffle Flavour Infused Oil but under ingredients it shows sunflower & olive oil"
0;I purchased Marshalls Creek bay leaves and what a waste of money that ended up being.  I had spider webs and mold somehow inside the supposedly sealed container.  I purchased 5 other Marshalls Creek herbs and seasoning and I noticed similiar situations with those as well.
0;First off I want to say that I love Malt-O-Meal its great but do not buy from this seller they completely rip you off with the shipping which is about the same price as the product. If you want to buy some Malt-O-Meal go to http://mybrands.com/Product.aspx?pid=3866 not only is the product cheaper the shipping is reasonable.
0;"""I ordered three of these but they were NOT like the picture. Antlers were cut in half the long way. This exposes all of the marrow and dogs will chew it up too quickly.  Not a good value for the money.  Also"
0;"""This was one of the most foul tasting products I have ever tried.  I first tasted it plain (the many positive reviews tricked me into thinking it would be edible) and I had to spit it out.  I gave it a fair try- I put in on a sandwich"
0;This product tastes horrible.  Nothing like peanut butter....running consistency.....odd after taste and smell.  It's definitely not an alternative to peanut butter.  My whole family tried it and it one person likedit.
0;"""Like others I was desperate to find a lower calorie alternative to peanut butter and made a special trip to a store to purchase this jar.  I wish I had come here first and read the reviews!!<br /><br />Horrible!  Utterly nasty.  It tasted way too sweet and nothing like peanut"
0;This peanut butter isn't cheap and it's awful! I normally eat natural peanut butter (just peanuts and some salt) or specialty peanut butter from Peanut Butter & Co. I'm health conscious and decided to give Better'n PB a try since it's less calories and fat. OMG-- the consistency is gluey and the taste is awful. I had to spit it out. It tastes nothing like peanut butter. It tastes rancid and medicinal. Don't buy this! The fat and calories from pure peanut butter are much more worth it and are healthier for you than a nasty PB with a long list of ingredients.
0;I ordered this product and when it arrived it was expired - by 4 months. Unfortunatly I did not notice this until  I went to use it a couple of weeks later. What company send expired products? This is enough for me to never order from them ever again!
0;GREAT crackers.  But for those who say these are cheaper than at their store they probably weren't including shipping.  Shipping to me made these $4.40 for each package.  Our local and very expensive grocery store sells them for $4.
0;This review is based on only using this product once according to the directions.  I used it in a brownie recipe in place of real eggs.  The brownies didn't fully cook after 25 minutes and I wasn't going to bake them any longer.  They were ruined.  I may take the other reviewers suggestion and use twice as much next time.  Kinda disappointed as I bought this for my nephew who is allergic to milk and egg.
0;"""I received bags of vanilla flavored very crunchy  cookies  - DOESNT NOT match the actual brand of  nilla vanilla wafers  depicted. I was very disappointed since these are much harder/crunchier than the actual brand name ones. The dog likes them so at least they won't go to complete waste."""
0;You would think someone from Amazon would have checked out this product before putting them out on the market.Not even worth giving a one star rating.Will have to think twice before buying any other food item from Amazon.
0;I enjoy Japanese tea sometimes during meal times... This tea is too weak  and  doesn't cut it for me ...I love  Costco product but green tea and their fresh Okami sushi urghh !!!.. These two product needs to go
0;Product. Was expired. Called company they said I can't prove I bought there which I can prove but anyways they said no refunds or exchanges.  I will never buy again and I hope no one else does poor custmoer service<br /> The only reason I gave them one star is amazon won't let u give no stars
0;I drink tea for more than 20 years and I tell you: this tea sucks! I brew it with 6oz of water at 70 degrees celsius. Tea is flavorless! Cheap stuff! I am going back to mitsuwa supermarket or maruka supermarket for green tea.
0;"""if you think this tastes like japanese green tea you must have been drinking cardboard which would be the next step below what this  green tea  tastes like = colored water. 2 tea bags make it a little better"
0;"""I have been drinking green tea for over 20 years and I've never tasted anything like this.  Do you remember the taste of  home grown  during the 70s?  That's exactly what this tastes like.  Pass on this one!"""

0;Embarrassing comedy that comes over like a child with 'attention deficit disorder' begging for your approval. Even the film's own internal logic is thrown away towards the end to no extra purpose. The girl floating in the air at the end is rather sweet though.
0;Come on now.  how can you make a 20th anniversary deluxe edition without having the original version.  Not to say it is not a great movie but hey there is no need to edit the movie just so you can show it on disney channel.  I mean no offense but did the producers of this movie say hey why not edit it like a CD so we can sell it at walmart.  Come on where is the love of a good movie.
0;"""Don't waste your money on this item. Looks deceivingly big online but when you actually get the item you'll be really disappointed. There's about $3 worth of candy and you'll be paying $20 for the box. I felt conned after receiving the item and wanted to return it. However"
0;This Christmas tower of sweets was actually samples of treats. I was very disappointed. The description was very misleading. I will never purchase this product again. Everything was sample size. I could have brought good snacks at the mall for this price and had plenty for everyone.
0;cookies where crushed product was left over from fathers day  what a way to send a gift dont buy nothing is freash poor product company broadway baskeers sell old product hat should be off the market you can image how i felt sent a small get well wish with old food as well as crushed items dont buy unless you want to feel as bad as i do plus they dont care about customers because they never responded to this or to try to make it right. special note to amazon this was never response from  this company broday basketeer that company doest care
0;This is the worst coffee General Foods has ever produced. It has a strange odor and an unpleasant taste that will send you for the mouth wash. I hope I can return the four cans I purchased. The Orange series has been my favorite for years but this one is a disaster.
0;"""I purchased this product last year from Amazon for 40.95 with free shipping.<br />This company distributing it now jacked the price up to 68.00 plus shipping.<br />Shipping cost 28.99 which is only about 11.00 less than what I paid for Amazon's<br />case! Add tax in and you're looking at a whopping 102.94 for this now.<br />Although I like this product"
0;"""The description claims this balsamic comes in  jars . I should have examined the picture more closely. This balsamic comes in a plastic squeeze bottle. There are already enough health concerns around plastic containers without adding something so acidic to the mix. Combine this with the heat encountered during shipping and the combo only gets worse.<br /><br />Note that this item is *not* eligible for return either."""
0;"""I stock my shelves with Iced Cafe Mocha for unknown reasons any pack with an August 2013 expiry tastes like chalkly chocolate and the texture is thicker. I am trying to return my recent purchases. It is so frustrating. I really miss the original Iced Cafe Mocha. It was perfectly sweetened"
0;"""I've been researching Orgain online trying to figure out what happened considering I used to live on it but now can no longer even FIND it. Like many of the other reviews mention - I lived on this stuff for breakfast and would purchase it by the case for months. I immediately noticed the flavor change that other reviews have mentioned (I always ordered the chocolate flavor) and agree the new ingredient flavor change was NOT for the better. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Then I suddenly realized that Orgain was no longer available at ALL in my local Whole Foods where I used to find it in both the shelf and chilled sections of the store. I then noticed that my 'subscribe & save' case shipping from Amazon quit shipping entirely after a years on-going subscription. I mentioned this to the friend who first introduced me to Orgain only to hear her tell me that our very popular and local vegetarian grocery store"
0;"""I had my whole family hooked on Orgain. I made my kids drink one every morning with their breakfast. It was my breakfast every morning as well as my husbands. We loved Orgain so much that we had several cases auto shipped to us every month. Then a couple months ago"
0;"""What are these people writing reviews thinking?  I bought the Creamy Chocolate Fudge based on the great reviews it got. It tastes terrible!  It has some type of aftertaste that I can't even describe. Gasoline?  At $3 each"
0;"""WHEN THEY CALL IT BREAD THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH..........IT'S MOSTLY BREAD WITH A LITTLE FLAVORING INSIDE.  I HAVE BEEN BUYING THIS ITEM FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND IT'S GOTTEN LOUSIER EVERY YEAR.  AT FIRST IT WAS VERY TASTY WITH LOTS OF CHEESE AND RECOGNIZALE VEGES AND MEATS INSIDE BUT NOT SO ANYMORE.  I DECIDED TO TRY IT ONE MORE TIME AND I REGRET THAT DECISION.  IT'S NOW TASTELESS ROLLS OF BREAD WITH NO CHEESE AT ALL.  AND DRY....OHHH.... SO DRY!!!  I WILL DEFINITELY NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.  I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A NEW CHEF BUT I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE IT IS BEING MADE WITH CHEAPER AND POORER QUALITY FOOD WITHOUT SAVING $$ IN MIND.  MAYBE YOU'LL LIKE EXPENSIVE DRY"
0;Photo does not represent the product description. Bought this thinking it was the larger wine bottles (wanted to use for wedding) but I received the small soda-size bottles. Completely waste of time and money! Beware if buying from this seller... received really bad customer service! Now I have a bunch of soda bottles just sitting around! Never buying from seller again.
0;My wife wanted to try this after seeing it highlighted on Dr. Oz as the best sugar alternative for hot drinks.  We tried it in coffee and tea and the flavor was so strong it overpowered the flavor of the drink you were adding it to.  No thank you Dr. Oz.
0;"""I can guarantee every reader of this review that not a single taste test was conducted for this horribly inferior snack cake. Maybe it was my epectation for something delicious that would satisfy my hunger for something cakey and chocolatey. It has its share of chocolate but it takes like spoonfuls of flour flavored with an inferior chocolate powder. And it looks nothing like its picture on the package. There's barely a thin layer of cream"
0;I purchased these centipedes for my grandchildren.  They are way to tough and chewy for them or me.  I am truly disappointed and now I have to see if I can pawn these bugs off on to someone else.  Wish I could return them.  AWFUL!!!! I have purchased Trolli Gummi Worms and they are soft chewy and delicious.
0;I bought these cashews thinking they were premium nuts and my wife and I both agreed they were old and stale and flavorless. If your smart stick with the standard Planter's cashews they have more flavor and are fresher.
0;Candy appears to be old and some of the individual fruit slices were actually slimey!  Couldn't find a single piece that looked fresh.  No expiration date on box either so they are going in the trash!  Big waste of money.  Plastic on outer cardboard package ripped.  Unsatisfied... Only good point was that shipping was prompt.
0;At first I thought I was getting a good price for the all spice but then went to the dollar store and found the same jar there. This was a rip off! I will check the dollar store first next time. one star for being over priced. The product was not that flavorful as other allspice that I have had in the past either. I would not buy this brand again. Another thing the picture showes the bottle full but when it came it was about half full.
0;Buyer beware- do not sign up for subscribe and save unless you love this product. I have tried in vain to cancel this item since February of 2011. Yet Amazon continues to charge and ship a product I don't want.<br /><br />The product doesn't taste good. Amazon is horrible to work with.
0;"""I was intrigued by the claim that this non-carbonated but caffeinated drink would actually burn calories although I wouldn't quite know how to really prove or disprove that it does. But I found it interesting enough to order this  dietary supplement "
0;Maybe I didn't know what to expect but this salt is more like brown and dirty looking than gray. Also it seemed wet and was stuck all over the inside of the bag like it was exposed to condensation.<br />Didn't use it because of it's look so really can't comment on the taste or usefullness.
0;"""It sounded like a good treat. But the actual product feels like a piece of boring plastic! Not one of the four dogs I give chews to - two of whom love to chew and aren't picky - found this remotely interesting. It has no texture"
0;"""I returned this product immediately.  First 2 ingredients were Salt and Monosodium Glutamate.  The website portrays the product as Bonito Fish and Seaweed soup stock - I couldn't find the ingredient list - so mistakenly trusted the discription. I planned to use the product as the base for Miso Soup"
0;The image shown for these petals have a light pink hue to them. Instead what I received are two Pepto-Bismol colored bags of petals instead. They are WAY darker than the picture and I am frustrated that they would post such a false image for this product! So here's my picture: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B004NWS0PI/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_1?ie=UTF8&index=1.<br /><br />False advertising=unhappy customer. :/
0;The shipping cost is excessive but even if it were free shipping this popcorn does not work well in either my oil-free microwave popper nor in my air popper...In either case it leaves far too many unpopped grains and under popped grains.  Those that do pop are not tender like most other white popcorn I've used....I wouldn't use this popcorn even if it were a gift.
0;"""i bought these when they stopped having the original nong shim kimchi noodles available for subscription. they are NOT the same and htey taste awful!!! there is a super strong fish flavor i do not like. they are nothing like the original kimchi noodle bowls. if you want the yumtastic noodles that are my favorite ramen instant noodles ever"
0;"""I have been having two different brands of Pu-Erh tea that my friend hand carried from China since last year. They taste very smooth and gentle to the stomach that I enjoy very much. I started to look for more Pu-Erh tea online as I was running out of them. I saw this brand online and gave it a try. Unfortunately"
0;I was very annoyed with these dyes.  In order to get bold colors I had to add a lot of dye and then the icing had a strange taste to it.  The copper is pink. The black is actually purple.  These were just not worth the hassle.
0;Was very disappointed to find that this product has high fructose corn syrup in it.  I don't know if this is common for all icing colors or not but I guess I figured since it was Kosher that maybe it wouldn't have those type of ingredients.  Wish I could return it but doesn't pay off because I would have to pay for shipping to return.
0;These taste gross and I would not eat them. They are going in the trash!!! Dont waste your money. You are better off just eating something else. I was very disappointed that the reviews said they were tasty because they are anything but. My dog wont even eat them.
0;"""I am not sure weather others allergic to this product. I am not allergic to very many food items. Especially I don't get itchiness to regular process food items like chips but this one did. So the whole thing was a waste"
0;"""I am anxious to find salted/cheese flavored snacks.....well the salt/grated cheese shakers are a lot more appealing. The aftertaste may send you right for the Hershey bar. There is also a funky stomache feeling too. I was desperate enough to try this stuff twice (I did have a box of 12)....it wasn't the result of a bad first impression"
0;This chocolate bar which I have tasted before when living in Zurich is a far cry from the fresh product you buy over the counter in that city. It is stale and has a taste of something that has been sitting for a long time on some shelve. I posted a review before and it was somehow deleted so here. It is very stale!
0;"""I purchased a 12-pack of Kashi GOLEAN Peanut Butter & Chocolate bars for myself and my family. We tried one and nobody wanted to finish it. It tasted way too much like a  power  bar. I didn't expect a candy bar"
0;LESSON LEARNED... never never NEVER EVER buY BULK stuff without trying it first.  I thought i'd be saving money buying this concentrate as it was so much more cost effective than buying individual concentrate at the store.  and it has less sweeterner which is always a problem being too sweet for me.  BUT BARF BARF BARF!!!!!  i honestly tried to dilute this with some regular tea and tried with soy milk and almond milk and its just bitter and has some sort of pungent after taste.. unfortunately i am left with 5 plus jugs of this and have no idea what do do with this gross stuff.  i'd highly advise trying this BEFORE YOU BUY... YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME DIFFERENT taste buds to enjoy this strange brew.
0;"""I have a pure bred Rottweiler who LOVES to eat.  I seen this on Amazon and although it had no reviews the price was right so I figured I would try this.  Never again.  My dog wouldnt even swallow this.  He had a few kibbles in his mouth which he spit out.  I left the food in the bowl for a few days watching him to see if it was the food or possibly the heat (as to why he was not eating.)  It was the food.  I replaced this with another kind he likes and he quickly ate it up.  I would not recommend this food at all"
0;The ingredients sounded so delicious but then I tried making it to match my mouth watering fantasies about how it SHOULD taste.........Yukkkkk!  The lentils are hard little rocks that do NOT even soften no matter how long the soup is simmered.  There really isn't any mushroom flavoring in the watery soup base.  I ended up throwing out the first pack I dained to make edible but I gave away the rest of the packs to the local food bank.  Do not buy this discusting soup unless you're going to add a gazillion things to it to make it have any taste at all but I wouldn't ruin all those other 'ingredients' by adding this soup to them. I have learned my lesson about this company and will NEVER buy any of their products again!!!  My stomach turns over just thinking about how AWFUL this soup is.
0;"""Sorry to be the ugly duckling in this little get together and it's good to hear the others seem to really like the taste of this particular candy bar but I just can't get beyond the fact that they are pumping this thing chock full of air and promoting it as all things well and good. To me"
0;These coffee pods come up when you search for Jamaica Me Crazy K-cups.  So yeah I was in a hurry and ordered these by mistake....  Guess what!  They are NOT returnable.  Thanks a lot Amazon!  You are no longer a source of k-cups for me.
0;I was basically pleased with this product but it only lasted 2 years with average to light use. It should have lasted longer. Their customer service merely suggested i buy the newer model but i will shop a different company.
0;"""I'm a big fan of regular Twizzlers. If you think that these Sweet & Sour Filled Twists are anything like regular Twizzlers then you will be sorely disappointed. These taste absolutely horrible. They taste like sucking on a bottle of cleaning supplies"
0;"""FORCED to give it 1 Star because the system wont accept NO STARS.<br /><br />I ordered this cake for my son in the military and had it rushed delivered to him at Ft. Campbell.  It was packed well and arrived on time.<br />The CAKE itself was TERRIBLE.  Noone at the party ate more than one bite.<br />White GREASE was the tasteless frosting and edible decorations were also<br />terrible.  They wanted to lie and tell me it was good so I would not feel like I wasted good money.  However"
0;"""I'm not sure if the product was kept on the shelf too long Or if it went through a drastic temperature change while in transportation. But there was something wrong with the product. My cat loves The flaked tuna feast from fancy feast but she did not eat 1 can from the package I ordered from you.  the expiration date was good"
0;"""This  Level 2  dreck is not even close to the Seattle's Best Breakfast Blend you may have enjoyed in the past. Not dark. Not rich. Mediocre at best. The note on the label is downright deceptive. This  Four Levels  foolishness is one of those cases of fixing something that was not broken. I have sadly been forced to give up on Seattle's Best."""
0;This sushi-making kit is a joke! For less than $10 you can get the exact same items from asianfoodgrocer online:<br />Sushi Mix: $2.68<br />10 Nori Sheets $1.28/ea<br />Wasabi Paste (1.41 oz) $1.28<br />Sushi Mat $1.00/ea<br />10-pack Chopsticks $1.00<br />Complete rip-off!
0;Jiffy cornbread is quite possibly the worst cornbread mix on the planet. I've been using Marie Collander's for years but Jiffy had a big sale so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />It was AWFUL! The texture is sandy and it does not rise. I baked it at the recommended temperature and time but it ends up very thin in the pan. And the taste is horrible.<br /><br />The fact that I just finished dinner and had to get on here immediately and write this negative review should be enough to scare you away from this product.<br /><br />I cannot overstate how awful this is.
0;"""I expected chewy bars but these are thin and hard. I thried to chew one but spit it out. No pumking taste! I guess those are chips of almonds but no taste of that either. And don't expect to bite this off"
0;I ordered this when I read gluten free. Item was sent with a note stating oats are considered gluten free. I did not realize it may have been packaged around gluten products. As I fond out must be the reason I got a negative reaction with this product. Now I'm stuck with 10 lbs of something I can't use. I need a product that is safe for me. Bad advertising.
0;"""Ordered six  hairball formula  bags of cat food. Received  Adult Formula. <br />Sorting through the multitude of areas is mind boggling. There must be a simpler way to notify that you've received the wrong item.<br />Usually Amazon is much more responsive.<br /><br />Also...the packaging is awkward. I ordered small packages to make them easier to handle and store but they come packed together and are awkward to handle until the wrapping is removed."""
0;"""The sole reason I purchased the Tassimo machine was because I love Starbucks coffee. I think it is disgraceful the prices that are being charged for the T-discs for Starbucks coffee since Starbucks discontinued their relationship with Tassimo. On average"
0;i wouldn't trust ANY of the 5 star reviews on here.  I am a chocolate lover and these are simply unpalatable.  I have better success mixing stevia with cocoa powder and coconut oil.  There is a better product out there (chocoerfection) those are delish!
0;The Amazon description says the soynuts are dry roasted.  The packaging clearly indicates that they have been roasted in oil.  I feel cheated: there is no way I would have placed the order had I known.
0;"""I agree with the above review that speaks to the false listing of ingredients. My can lists only  roasted barley and rye  but it is very sweet???  No indication in the ingredients of beetroot or other sweetener. In which other respect are the claims on the label false ( no preservatives"
0;"""I don't usually write negative reviews ... I just don't write anything at all ... but this product is SO BAD that it deserves a really bad review.  FIRST PROBLEM: it is supposedly low in carb but it takes a stick of butter and a mountain of heavy cream to make it.  Huh? Low carb but heart attack fat?  YUK.  SECOND PROBLEM: it is very difficult to make - it has three different bags"
0;"""I ordered a box of raspberry flavored bars and they sent me the coffee flavor instead. This bar is truly amazing but I only like the raspberry and peanut butter flavor. The coffee flavor tastes like soap and I am very disappointed that for the price I paid"
0;"""I agree with the person who termed these  inedible .  I was sent the wrong flavor and ended up with a box of cocoa-coffee instead of the cocoa raspberry I had ordered.  The bar was bitter and terrible.  I worked on the assumption that perhaps another flavor would be better.  I tried the lemon bar"
0;"""It didn't come in the package that I expected.  It was sent in a plastic ziplock with a printed information label.  End of the day it is hard to even know what your really got.  But then again I am not an expert of green teas.  For the price"
0;"""It came vacume packed and I assumed after reading the reviews it was going to be at the very least an  average  macha. NOT SO...it was stale and dull like it was VERY OLD and as if it was left out. I have purchased less expesive machas from Taiwan and have been happy with the product. Appearntly healthway buys this in bulk and they do not have any quality control. You can tell by the smell of the dried powder that the tea is obviously not acceptable to consume. I WILL BE DEMANDING A REFUND!!!!!!!!!! FYI want the best bang for your buck Id buy - Vita Life Matcha."""
0;I received an email from Amazon that the product I have on order has to be modified to a larger quantity (2 24s to 50) . I followed their instructions and it didn't work. I also noticed that when they ship on repeat orders they raise the price on you

0;"""I bought the vegetable soup at a County Fair expecting a hearty and varied vegetable soup.  But the soup is misnamed.  It should be called  potato soup  because that's all that is in it.  This  soup is expensive so you'd think they'd at least include a few veggies.  But no"
0;"""We just opened our 5lb bag of coffee and the first thing we noticed is that the beans had no oil left on them. Not a good sign. The smell was a bit off and you didn't get that enjoyable aroma that you do from fresh beans.<br /><br />Then we brewed a pot.<br /><br />Rancid is the kindest word I can use. Flavorless but for the sour taste"
0;"""I love having Ginger Ale to drink especially when my stomach isn't feeling well so I tried to purchase this and see how I would like it. It was nothing like I imagined it to taste like. It has a real taste to the actual ginger root and I was highly disappointed because it was nothing like what I expected especially with all the positive reviews. So Buyer Beware that this product has that ginger root taste to it. And now I am stuck with the bulk that I purchased"
0;"""I sent a box (pack of 10) to my Mother who lives in another state. She and a friend opened a packet to sample and both said the cherries were  hard as a rock.

I was disappointed as I was hoping to introduce her to a healthy snack item."""
0;"""Another reason not to buy this (from Newdsay):<br /><br /> A Sea Cliff food company said Thursday it was recalling a snack called Veggie Booty because it had been alerted by the federal government of possible salmonella contamination. <br /><br />Ouch!

0;"""I got these hoping for a more healthy version instead of drinking coffee every morning.  I've tried two of them and don't care to try any more.  They are very bitter!  Unfortunately went through my coffee first"
0;"""I  should have looked more carefully at the types of tea in this awful variety pack.  I just saw the package and assumed it had a variety of fruity tea.  Instead it has mostly icky black tea and green tea.  It has some Lemon Zinger and Sleepytime.  Where is the hybiscus"
0;I was expecting a lot more from this coffee. It was extremely bland and had very little coconut flavor. We couldn't even force ourselves to finish the cup. The only we have now is what to do with the remaining 22 K-cups we have left...
0;Was unhappy with the flavor. I ordered under the assumption that the coffee would be the same quality that I have so enjoyed in restaurants. I will not be re ordering this particular product. If any one has ordered any Douwe Egbert product that meets the quality that is in restaurants PLEASE let me know!!! There must be something that is out there. Thanks!
0;This product is undrinkable when brewed using a Hamilton Beach Senseo single cup brewer.  I even tried using 2-pods w/o success.  They weren't kidding when they said designed for the other brew machine.  3/19/12
0;first off this company is a joke. they sell expired tea. look at the back of your tea and see how it is expried. mine was expired in 2003 I bought in 2007. stale to say the least. They are crooks and trying to make a fast buck off Japanese culture. I am insulted to say the least.<br /><br />I filed with amazon and reported them to the better business burough.<br /><br />Would you serve your kids a 5 year old bag of chips? how about a five year old box of mac and cheese? this stuff will make you sick!<br /><br />They are the rudest people around and DO NOT SUPPORT THEM!! if you have any respect for Japanese culture you will boycott this company!!!<br /><br />no way will what you get even look remotely what is in the picture! they are a non successful company selling trash!!! Old stock and instead of keeping fresh stock the peddle out olld stock at a high fresh price!!<br /><br />BOYCOTT THEM!!!
0;"""We purchased 6 of these bottles (2 pkgs) as well as a previous package of 3 (9 in total).  My daughter is not even 6 months old and already those that are remaining are crystalized on the bottom but worse than that"
0;"""I originally bought playtex ventair advanced bottles and I loved them. although as a new mom I didn't think to buy enough bigger ones for more ounces. I love the curved bottles and I seen these were 4 dollars cheaper than the ones I bought originally"
0;"""I bought these for my second daughter because I was looking to replace our 5-year old Avent bottles with BPA-free.  I chose these because of the Evenflo name and the design/shape.  Horrible decision.  Every one of them has broken when dropped.  Not only did I spend money on buying these bottles in the first place"
0;"""I bought one set of these because we needed some extra bottles and the price was lower. I never have the energy to keep bottles clean at the same rate my daughter uses them. I usually use glass bottles but wanted to try a different style out. The glass bottles have proven to be a far better investment. By six weeks"
0;"""We purchased 15 of these bottles because they worked well for our daughter other than the fact you have to very carefully put the milk/powder in the small opening and they will leak if the collar is not screwed on just right or the nipple will collapse if the collar is screwed on too tightly.<br /><br />However"
0;These bottles are really quite bad. Maybe if you started your baby on them and she/he was used to them from the begining... but the nipples are too hard. There is no venting so LOTS of bubbles form. Baby has to stop drinking to relieve pressure. I'm sticking with Dr. Browns bottles... they do have a lot of parts - but they are by far the best ones I've tried.
0;"""We got these when we were switching from nursing to formula.  I liked the angled aspect among other things.  Well...I am not satisfied with these at all!  They leak 90% of the time and it is just a pain!  I found a  way/method  of screwing the tops on so that they don't leak too bad"
0;"""I bought these bottles for my 4 month old daughter because they were one of the few BPA free choices at the time.  In four months 8 of these bottles have cracked at the bottom!  I thought at first it was a fluke or that I had overused a specific bottle"
0;"""I bought these bottles because I liked that they were BPA free and they looked comfortable.  They are awful.  There's a lip inside the bottle that's a pain and makes it feel cheap.  And the real reason I hate this bottle"
0;"""As soon as I dumped the seasoning packet in I knew it was going to be bad.  My kitchen was instantly filled with an awful smell that only got worse as it cooked.  If it were up to me at this point I would have stopped and made something else.  But my wife insisted we stay the course and eat this meal.  To describe the smell I think excrement works best"
0;Why is this in the Gluten Free store? Read the ingredients.  It contains wheat.  It might be a great product but it should not be in this listing. Please remove it and the other Helper products.  They all seem to contain wheat.  If you don't have celiac disease you can disreguard this complaint.
0;"""Worst experience I've ever had with bread. I usually LOVE Bob's Red Mill products. I've used everything from the low carb baking mix to their almond flour. Fabulous! But the low-carb bread mix? Awful. I bought 2 mixes. I followed instructions carefully and ended up with a mass of strawlike fingers criss-crossing over a misshapen loaf the first time. And it tastes awful! Strangely gluely"
0;In all honesty I don't know why you'd make box spaghetti when you're already most of the way for making real spaghetti after cooking the meat. For me it was absolutely bland and flavourless. I would never recommend this. I think next time I'll just stick to making spaghetti with regular sauce and noodles. The nice part is that it doesn't take long to make I guess. I was incredibly disappointed with this product.
0;"""I strongly urge you to reconsider purchasing this item. I am have purchased a few different items from this particular seller that have been wonderful. I started to get nervous of the extra calories I was consuming in the regular matcha green tea powder so I purchased this item. It did taste fine"
0;The place that sells and ships this for Amazon thinks nothing of sending<br />very badly dented cans.  I ordered a large amount of this and over half of the cans were dented very badly.  The type of dents a can gets from a high fall which tells me these people are not the least bit careful with the food we are supposed to eat.  I will not buy anything that this company has anything to do with.
0;"""Had read the reviews of others about items arriving open/sticky and hoped they were not the normal... When I opened product thought I was lucky... now am getting further into box more and more are sticky or opened... What seemed like a good deal works out not being so"
0;I received the undamaged box promptly.  Upon opening the box I discoverd a sticky mess.  Some of the liquid creamer packets had opened during shipment and the entire inside of the box was covered with a sticky goo.  Amazon's great customer service took care of the problem immediately.  Eventhough the order was non-returnable I received an email with 24 hours of my complaint to trash the box and was issued a credit.  I rate the shipment a 0 but I rate Amazon's customer service a 10+.
0;Oh man!  This stuff is so gross!  I made it for dinner tonight as a part of my continuing effort to find the perfect chili.  This one lands DEAD LAST on my list!  I followed the instructions to the letter.  It had the nastiest flavor (or lack thereof).  My husband actually spit it back out.  We ended up dumping it and eating out.  Ick.  DO.  NOT.  BUY.  THIS.  &lt
0;There in no discription of how big the bottles are.  The bottles of the 4 hot sauces are small than a 5 hour energy bottle.  Each bottle has less than an ounce of sause.  My order was for a gift and I was embarrassed to give this to anyone.  Diffently not worth the price.
0;these arrived fairly fast but the size was really small.  also what they charged for shipping was almost triple what it cost.  they used a free box from the post office and barely any packing peanuts. the description does not say how big the bottles are and it is deffinatly a rip off.

0;"""I have wanted a Keurig coffee maker for over a year.  I purchased one for Christmas and bought a package of Cafe Escapes Mocha and Cafe Escapes cocoa for under the tree.  Both are watery disappointments...mere instant coffee/cocoa.  I might as well buy a box of cocoa or a tin of International Coffee and heat up some water.  What a waste of money.  Not the coffee maker"
0;I just got my Cuisinart Keurig in this past weekend.  I was really looking forward to trying this one so I bought a sample pack from a store.  I won't be buying any more of these that's for sure!<br /><br />I have to say - it reminded me of the International Instant coffees you find in the Grocery stores.  For as much money as the cups cost - just go buy those international instant coffees instead.<br /><br />I'm a big coffee drinker and this wasn't close to anything that I expected...YUCK!
0;I just bought a Keurig and was excited to find Cafe Mocha pods. What a waste of $12. They're just awful. They taste so artificial. How'd these get past consumer testing before they went to market?<br /><br />Spend your time and money on figuring out how to make a really worthwhile mocha with your Keurig. Forget about the Cafe Mocha pods.
0;This is basically watery hot chocolate..... Bad tasting and bitter watery hot chocolate. I'm not sure if there's any coffee in it at all but I can't take more than a couple sips. A waste of money Keurig I'm disappointed.
0;I have bought two different cases with same result  --  This tastes terrible  -- It is watery  no coffee flavor  -- you would do better by not buying it  -- I have been more than disappointed with these flavor pods  -- I have used several  types  --  The teas taste un natural  just stick with your tea bags you buy at grocery store  --  The coffee are all instant  -- and unless you are huge fan of instant bland coffee go for it  --  There are no flavor in the flavor pods  -- I have one suggestion  make yourself  --  which defeats the purpose of this thing  --  I have bought the coffee filter which has down fails too-- First grinds get everywhere which ok except you know if you are going from a hot cider to  coffee you may have coffee grinds in everything  ---  and you can only make one cup at a time  -- what a pain  -- if you are using own coffee grinds  --  first it gets everywhere  -- then it only makes one small cup at  a time ---  then you have to clean out filter  -- which is very hot  --
0;"""I agree with the others who have given this a poor review. Tastes like watered down hot chocolate with a hint of coffee flavor. Open up the used k cup and it's empty. Definetely not worth the money for instant coffee and hot chocolate mix"
0;"""I don't know why they call this coffee - it's watered down hot chocolate with a bit of coffee flavor thrown in.  While I enjoy a good cup of hot chocolate with a shot of espresso now and then this has nothing to do with that.  It's watery (even on the small cup setting)"
0;I was quite disappointed. It was anything but soft as Darrell Lea claims it to be. I purchased 2 bags and both bags were absolutely horrible. I would not recommend this to anyone. (Strawberry flavored one)
0;"""I used the thermometer about 7 or 8 times and it stopped working.  I have seen several reviews complaining that the probe fails so I'm hoping that's the problem.<br /><br />Update 2/27/08: I ordered a new probe from Brookstone for $25 (incl. shipping) and it is a much sturdier design than the original.  I assume they were getting a lot of complaints and returns so they redesigned it.  So far the new probe is working fine.  Interesting to note"
0;"""I have owned several of these and given a few away as gifts. I LOVE how well they work when they are brand new so when mine failed I bought new ones assuming I just got a lemon. THEY ARE ALL LEMONS. My observation of several units is that the average service life is from 3 to 6 uses. Sometimes a new probe fixes the problem ($20 ea) sometimes nothing (including hitting the reset button) helps. Look at other product reviews on different web sites"
0;Recieved this as a gift and loved it.  But two issues. no timer and no way to override the preset temperature settings.  Then at about 3 months or so it failed. Went to the store and they said I was using the wrong brand of batteries (?). They sent me packing and I tossed it in the trash when I got home.
0;"""Cool idea for a product but the one I got is junk unless you don't mind a meat thermometer that jumps from 60 deg to 299 deg and back again within a few seconds and alarms every time it give an erroneously high reading"

0;I order this sugar on a regular basis.  Usually I have no problem however in the box that I just received approximately 50% to 60% of the packets had no sugar in it.  There is a serious issue with quality control.
0;"""About 40% packets had no sugar in them and a bunch others were open and leaking. The sugar grains were clumpy and in some packets stuck into a square mass. The product seemed old and not freshly packed as I have noticed the fair trade packets to be in for example the local Starbucks locations. The product is not returnable hence a total waste of the $30"
0;"""I thought this was supposed to be premium soup.  Progresso is usually associated with the higher end soups compared others such as Campbell.  Well this particular soup was all broth.  I think I encountered 6 pieces of chicken"
0;absolutely  ridiculous for AMAZON to allow someone to charge 175.00 and up to 200.00 for tassimo discs.  Taking advantage of amazon customers!! I thought AMAZON was about great pricing!!! shameful!!!!!
0;I do like the taste of this soup as I have purchased this in the past at the grocery store. I haven't been able to find it so when I saw this offered on Amazon I ordered several cases. To my disappointment all but 3 of the cans were severly dented and one was actually leaking. Amazon immediately sent replacements but sadly they arrived in the same condition. I'm not sure if this problem originated in the warehouse or was the result of poor packaging and shipping. The only reason I gave this one star is because of the superior customer service I received from Amazon. I will try this item again at a later date to see if they have corrected the problem.
0;I purchased this from another source so that I could just buy 1 of this variety. The product tasted terrible. Glad I didn't buy it in bulk from Amazon......<br />This review goes for all her other varieties as well... since I tried and tasted them.... what a waste of time and money. I ended up eating something else with taste for the rest of my dinner because this was so bad....
0;I have tried this granola localy and loved it. I saw the low price on Amazon a while back and bought a case. The stuff I got in the mail didnt taste at all like the granola I bought in the stores. It tasted like rancid powdered milk. After a mouthful I havent been able to eat This brand of granola again.
0;"""None of the BEAR NAKED GRANOLA products are organic nor do they contain any organic ingredients.  Further they DO contain genetically modified ingredients (GMOS).  These very misleading statements/descriptions by Amazon.com need to be removed immediately.  For those of us for whom eating organic food is very important because we do not want GMOs in our food"
0;"""I might be an adult but I still love mac and cheese and the  crazy bugs  gimmick got me. I picked this up at Walmart for $1.25. I prepared it on the stove and I was really annoyed to find out that the cheese packet powder is WHITE"
0;I purchased a Bear Naked chocolate / peanut butter granola cereal first part of last year 2009. The Peanut<br />Butter recall came out. I asked the Bear Naked company if this cereal was involved in the recall. They said no<br />it was not. I still did not open the cereal. Then 3 weeks later I actually found it on the recall list. Then they<br />listed it on their site. I inquired again and asked for a refund. Sent several emails and received no response.<br />They do not back their own products. They were apparently using crappy peanuts in there own cereal and did not even know the source of the peanuts. Can't trust them on any of there items. I never got a refund. This company cannot be trusted. Stay away.
0;"""Amazon doesn't allow zero star reviews...and the one star I had to allow is far too generous.  This product deserves about a negative 10 star designation.  It is not organic (one reviewer described finding it in the  organic  section of their local grocery store).  The label on the bag claims  100% pure & natural granola  (this claim is meaningless) and on the back has the following:<br /> No artificial flavors"
0;Buy the cheaper brands! What is the white stuff floating around in the bottles? This brand at one time was pretty good and at a decent price but they are apparently cutting corners and the quality is not there any longer. I have had many customer complaints and will not purchase again
0;"""We bought this Kikkoman Plum Sauce from our Grocery Store.  It was for a hung roasted whole duck from the local Asian Market.  This duck was as good as Duck I've had in Hong Kong. We made our own pancakes/crepes Hong Kong style.  We cut Fresh green spring onions.<br /><br />We tasted this sauce before ruining our duck. The sauce was absolutely the worst.  Bad flavor"
0;"""This is a waste of perfectly good coffee beans.They are roasted light-medium and is very bitter...undrinkable.African coffee should be full-city/dark roast.I do know coffee.I have roasted my own and at first made the mistake of not roasting it enough.The result tasted like this.I would not have bought this for myself.I bought it for a friend and am now going to have to eat the $32 I paid for it"
0;"""i am shocked by all the high reviews of this product.  i have a 14 lb dog that devours these chews in less than 60 mins.  they are worthless for my purposes.  i want to keep him occupied for a few days with a chew"
0;I ordered this product as a Christmas gift. When it arrived the lid was broken in serveral pieces so I had to throw it out since there was no returns. I wasn't going to give a gift that looked like it came from a surplus store. Will never order again.
0;Our dogs love these treats and 2 years ago were made in the U.S.  We thought we were giving them something healthy until we read the package and saw that they were now made in China.  We are now looking for a similar product made in USA.
0;"""It appalls me that companies can claim their products are gluten free and then go on to say that some people do have a reaction from them!  All experienced gluten suffers know to read ingredients and know that BARLEY is a no-no"
0;The order arrived in the stated delivery time frame and in good condition. That was the only thing satisfactory about this order and the only reason it got one star. The pumpkin seeds were very over toasted and covered in a white powder that turned to a paste consistency when wet. I have brought pumpkin seeds from many vendors and have never encountered this white powder. I suspect the powder was added to cover up the fact that the seeds were so very over toasted that they turned brown. I tossed these pumpkin seeds in the trash and suggest that no on e buys from this vendor.
0;Extremely disappointed. I trusted the brand and got a 4-pack. But this product is just too sweet. And there are barely any raisins in them. I would rather go for any in-house brand (like Ralphs) and get a better cereal than this. This cereal is very unhealthy.
0;"""Right on the box it says product of Mexico... nothing against any race or country but I prefer to have my food products made in the u.s.a .. This is basically raisin bran with some sweetened granola stuff added.. which could have been a nice twist to it.. EXCEPT .. it is WAY TOO SWEET . I finished the box but wont bother again.. This is a product I eat for both health reasons and enjoyment and this is a MAJOR FAIL . This much sugar turns it in just another sugar sweetened cereal..so common in america  these days it seems are unhealthy products disguised by bogus product labeling touting health benefits.To put this in perspective.. this cereal has 19 grams of sugar per cup.. Count Chocula has 15.6 grams per cup"
0;I ordered A case of dog food and these 4 boxes of cereal. I joined Amazon prime. 2 day free shipping. Awful packaging. Items got to me quickly that is about it. The cereal was wrapped in some kind of wrap and was crushed thanks to the Joes that packaged it. A simpleton knows that you don't put cereal in the same box as a case of dog food. Half of the boxes are mostly crumbs. Shop elsewhere for cereal
0;"""The texture of this cake was very moist but that was about the only thing we liked about it. I made it exactly as instructed on the box. My husband and I both thought that it had an  off  taste to it"
0;"""I have eaten other Pamela products and have been really impressed with the quality. I was really disappointed with the luscious chocolate cake mix. It was decent at best when fresh and a few hours later when the cake had cooled down the texture changed and it became really dense and chewy"
0;"""Buyer beware.  Notice how carefully worded the descriptions are to avoid stating the caffeine content.  Many other sites still quote Perky Jerky's original advertizing claim that Perky Jerky contains 150mg of caffeine (from guarana).  Before you buy you should know that"
0;I have only been recently diagnosed gluten intolerant (about six months).  I have learned very quickly that opinion on taste is extremely subjective when it comes to gluten free items.  What one person raves about another person will discard rather than eat.<br /><br />I tried this because others have given it good reviews.  In my opinion and my daughter's it is too grainy and has too much bean flour in it.  The bean flavor is too strong.  I am using the left over product to mix in with other flours.  I much prefer Pamela's product.
0;We have yet to find (trust me tried ALOT of them) a mix that Bob Red Mill's sells that taste good.  It's down right awful and gritty.  If you think this is good your surely missing out on alot of other great products.  It seems some new age products coming out are alot better tasting and the consistancy is much better.  Search around try Jules but this stuff is gross and regreted buying a case of it.
0;Take a look at the picture on the box and what do you see?  Big chunks of paneer and some liquid.  Well that's not what's in the box.  There are a few pieces of paneer and about 90% liquid with fat pooling on the surface.  This was a completed disappointment and I have 9 boxes to go.  Tasty Bite entrees are much better.  I don't care if this is the #1 brand in India - it's near the bottom of my list.
0;"""I used to buy this at Walmart a couple years ago all the time. They quit having it. I finally found it here. I was VERY disappointed. The company that makes it has changed it. The texture of the bread is different. It is not a soft bread anymore. The taste is different"
0;The candy I received was dried out with all sides sunk in with no liqueur at all despite that the chocolate was not melted. There was no expiration anywhere on the package to gauge how old the candy was.
0;Why do dog food companies insist on using fillers such as CORN? In the ingredients description they list it as Crunchy corn packed with carbohydrates for energy... Seriously? My dogs did eat it but I can't say wether or not they liked it but they did have horrid gasseous episodes for days. It comes down to this being the same old stuff in different packaging. Maybe if they put as much thought and effort into the quality of the food as they do in the packaging I would buy it again.
0;"""I was disappointed upon consulting the ingredients list of this food to find that the first ingredient listed was.....corn. I just can't recommend a dog food that contains more corn than it does any other ingredient.  The second ingredient was a meat  meal  and the next few were other grains.  While I do realize that dogs need balance in their diet just as we do"
0;"""I confess that I did not read the ingredients in this dog food before I hit the order button.  MY BAD!<br />I would NEVER give this to my dog after reading the ingredients.  It turns out many others have repeated the ingredient list (and the major flaws those ingredients pose for the health and longevity of your beloved pet) so I'm not going to repeat that info.<br />I really struggled with what to do with this new"
0;My dog Oliver will not touch his bowl since I have been feeding him Beneful. He literally has not eaten in 2 days. I am going to have to switch him back to Iams. I don't know why he doesn't like it but he just is not interested.
0;Tried one box.  Turned out terrible.  It stuck together into one big clump.  Tried another box. This time I put some oil in the water with hopes that it would keep it seperate.  Didn't work.  If anyone has tried this and knows how please let me know.
0;"""got this product for my dogs thinking what a good treat they would be--such a huge disappointment when they arrived. pieces were either broken (from being store so long they were brittle)or when i took out what was suppose to be a rawhide chewey"

I have now taken about 20 of these and I can't stand them"

0;"""I made a mistake of buying this tea during Christmas time and did the ultimate mistake of gifting some of the the individual packs to others. Worst tea I have ever tasted.

0;"""WARNING  One one canister of tea.  I buy this product all the time for about $25. I saw that the price had dropped a little to 19.99 so I quickly ordered it.

0;"""DO NOT ORDER these! I ordered these and gave them to my dog. Thankfully she dropped it on the floor and wasn't interested. I realized the name seemed familiar and I googled Beefeater Sweet Potato Treat Recall and found out these are the treats made in china that were giving dogs liver and kidney failure. Please please pleas DO NOT order these!!!!<br /><br />As soon as I realized I threw them all away and called Amazon. They were very helpful"
0;I was expecting this to be very tall and it came out to be tiiiiiiiinnny. The lids a a nuisance and keep falling off. The image was very very misleading and should have been next to a person. Would've returned it if it wasn't a gift to someone.
0;i have to say i was not pleased with the product apon arrival... it was not even in any type of box.. just wrapped in a bag.. the product itself had scratches on the plastic and seemed like cheap plastic... im surely not pleased with the price i payed for it
0;"""I don't use artificial sweeteners because of the free google documentary  Aspartame: Sweet Misery A Poisoned World.   This product has sugar and Splenda/Sucralose for some reason.  The documentary had enough scientific evidence to convince me never to use artificial sweeteners.  Donald Rumsfeld - yes that Donald Rumsfeld - was the head of the company that hid the horrifyingly negative studies concerning artificial sweeteners when artificial sweeteners were approved by the FDA.  The FDA officer in charge of the case later went on to work for the law firm used by Donald Rumsfeld's company and the head of the FDA at the time went on to work directly for Donald Rumsfeld's company"
0;"""Some of my friends were using Earth's Best formula and were raving about it so we decided to switch from Enfamil Infant Premium to the Earth's Best organic infant formula since it was available on Amazon subscription and was a little cheaper. I have to say that I was very disappointed with this product. It does not disolve well at all and leaves chunks of formula in the bottle regardless how well you mix it and whether you use warm or cold water to dilute it with. The baby does not seem to like it any more or less"
0;"""Earth's Best Formula we love! However I received a damaged item and cannot seem to get a hold of anyone to get it replaced. I tried emailing someone from the  Contact Us  button on the returns page and no one has responded. I will not feed my baby a can that has been dented with a broken seal"
0;I have stopped using earths worst when i discovered the organic food that i was buying had toxic lid on it. since than I have been using other organic foods and they all have been sensitive to bpa.<br /><br />I would recommend everyone to try happy baby cereals for example. it contains dha and probiotics.
0;Noticed the reviews about the change in formula. What bad practice...<br /><br />I did start noticing that my LO has been acting different and that mixing the formula kept leaving lumps. I'm guessing you can blame the added glucose syrups along with my S&S has been going up in price. From 82 to 97 dollars. I hate feeling taking advantage of just because I want the best for my LO. Shame on them for a shitty practice.<br /><br />BTW:<br /><br />Slighty same nutritional value as Walmart's Parent's Choice Organic Formula. Only difference I saw was a slightly higher calcium. I didn't go through the list one by one in ingredient but it is safe to say that they all come from the same manufacture. I will grab a can to find out.<br /><br />$62 dollars for a 4 pack compared to $97.
0;"""I am very mad at myself for not doing better research before selecting formula once my breast milk supply dwindled.  Do your own search!  The Obama Admin has said that organic formula should no longer be allowed to be marketed if it contains dha/ara made with hexane.  Organic foods for adults are not allowed to be labeled as organic if they are made with  hexane.  There are several articles out there discussing possible side effects including autism and ADHD from hexane.  I am switching to Baby's Only which is the only organic formula that contains Dha/ara not manufactured using hexane.  It says it is a toddler formula which is why I didn't consider using it to begin with.  Do your own research"
0;This company also sells the Spectrum brand and several other brands has the worst customer service.  We were not happy with this baby formula and they were not willing to return the product.  Also the woman at customer service was just simply not nice on the phone.
0;I ordered this on Amazon once before and they are ripping you off.  You can get 4 can's (20% more size) at Whole Foods for $29.99 a can and if you buy 4 you get a 10% discount.  That's only $112 dollars.  You do the math.  Oh...for my review...the formula is awesome.
0;Three out of five cans of formula arrived at my home completely dented and leaking powdered formula.  The packaging was completely inadequate.

0;"""We fed our son only Earth's Best formula from the day he was born. We have used this product for 7 months. My last purchase I looked on the ingredient list and to my surprise the formula had changed. It now has  organic glucose syrup solids ...added sugar. Why change a great product by adding sugar? I now will be changing to another product and possibly no longer use organic because I feel the added sugar is more harmful. Thank you Earth's Best for 7 months of a good product. Now the doctors thank you for adding to the obesity epidemic and the increase in type 2 diabetics in the US. You have lost a customer."""

I have to agree with the reviewer who noticed a terrible change in the tea's quality along with a change in the label color.  This second batch of tea smelled like weeds"
0;I received this item in a shipment of other items ordered from this store. I order black fungus or tree ear mushroom quite often. I know how they are suppose to look.

0;This is the nastiest protein shake I have ever tasted and I have tried plenty! I could not even swallow it because it was so nasty. It does not mix smoothly using a blender bottle or a blender. It might make a decent java shake if you mixed it into ice cream but that kind of defeats the point of having a protein shake!

I went to eat the rest of it and couldn't even bite into it! I had to gnaw it to get some off. And when I did it tasted like plain oatmeal held together with wax. It was disgusting. Missed it by a mile on this one Annie.
0;"""I am a long time fan of Moroccan mint teas and after reading the mixed reviews for this tea I decided to give it a try as $14 a pound would have been a steal.  Unfortunately the batch I received was completely undrinkable.  After following the recommended steep time and temperature the tea was overwhelmingly bitter and had almost no detectable mint flavor. I tried shorter and longer steep times with the same results every time.<br /><br />It is most likely that the batch I received was old because the mint oil in this kind of tea has a short shelf life"
0;"""I do not understand how others can say that this coffee is great! Looks like they have never been in Europe and have no clue how the real coffee should taste... Only positive I can say about this brand - it is cheap. If you want to save money"
0;I ordered these jordon almonds hoping I could get a good product using Amazon Prime. These are not good at all. they have a very hard thick coating that could easily break a tooth. The coating taste like hard sugar and you can not taste the almond at all. Very disappointed. Sorry.
0;"""I purchased this item because I wanted the tea chest.  The item description is completely inaccurate.  It states that it is a  Wood Grain  tea chest.  The chest is a cheap box that is very poorly covered with a wood grain contact paper.  I say poorly because the faux wood contact paper has ripples and bubbles all over it.  Please don't waste your money or time on this item like I did."""
0;What a disapointment. I should have taken heed to the negative review saying it was a cheaply covered veneer box. It does NOT look like wood. There is a horrible smell when I opened the box. Unfortunatly being a food product it is not eligible for return.<br /><br />I would not recommend this item for a gift or for a nice display of tea. I'm hoping that the tea is worth the cost of the entire item. . .
0;"""So I purchased this and now feel so suckered.  I was thinking I must have been starving when I ordered this.  Don't be dare fooled by the pictures and the other reviews of this product.  I am almost certain that Hormel has their employees or pays employees to write good reviews on their product here.<br /><br />I am a dude that usually eats just about anything.  I'm taking this  food  to a shelter or something.  I have not fully decided yet because I'm not so sure I want to put the homeless folks through it.  That's how bad the stuff is.  The chemical taste in the food is noticeable and it's down right nasty.<br /><br />I can't believe  I was duped into buying this product.  Hopefully I can get at least some satisfaction of knowing that someone homeless got to eat something. I don't usually waste my time writing reviews.  However"
0;What a terrible product to order from Amazon.  I opened the green beans to find that about half the cans were dented and some of those terribly.  A can that is as dented as some of these cans are not trustworthy to eat because it is unsure if the can is damaged enough to allow a leak inside which would make the beans spoil.
0;"""I am so horribly disappointed.<br /><br />I am a self-confessed Chicken Tikka Masala addict. I LOVE the stuff. I buy it at my local grocery store for $5.99 per 14 ounce jar. I buy the jars four at a time"
0;"""Having grown up in the Caribbean drinking coconut water from the source hundreds of times I can tell you unequivocally that this does not at all taste like coconut water. I got this today because earthfare was out of the brand I got last time"
0;Not sure why the flavor is not the same as their 17oz coconut water but this 10oz size does not taste like coconut water.  It is like someone concocted an artificial candy drink.  I cannot recommend this product!
0;I ended up buying this because Zico is now from concentrate (yuck) and based on reviews and comments from others who stopped buying Zico. Not sure what the others were drinking but it couldn't possibly be what I got. Amy and Brian's tastes like cotton candy. I love Thai coconuts even more than South American coconuts - in fact I go to Chinatown every chance I get to stock up on young coconuts just for the coconut water. This tastes NOTHING LIKE a real Thai coconut. I wouldn't even use this to make a smoothie. I guess it's back to Vita Coco until there's a good product on the market again. Or I suppose I could get a second fridge just to keep filled with green coconuts. Now I need to figure out what to do with the other 23 cans of this stuff.
0;"""Be sure to note that the reason they can call this 'grain free' is because they use potato and pea starch instead.

0;I didn't like these crackers at all.  They were (if it is possible) too crunchy.  Too many flavors and they fought with cheese and dips.  Seeds and hard and stick inbetween your teeth.  There are much better alternatives out there...
0;"""These are rice crackers and not very good ones. There are many other brands of rice crackers that are really moist and flavourful from Japan. If I had Celiacs disease I might consider having these around but you can't serve these to guests without a lot of explaining and some really sharp cheese. Be wary of making a 12 box commitment. Also these crackers come in a bag which means between 10%-25% are broken and they cannot be resealed which means they go flat very quickly. If you bought these and don't know what to do with them try opening the box and leaving it in the bathroom when you shower"
0;"""I bought the loose leaf tea thinking that the Twinings brand would be good quality.  I was very wrong.  This tea has the look and consistency of instant coffee NOT loose leaf tea. I made one cup and threw it out"
0;This product wasn't what I expected...it had a funky smell and it had a crunchy texture...it also didn't sit to well with my stomach if you know what I mean...I would not recommend this product...I still have some at home that I will just throw away...

0;"""I purchased a glass teapot for my mother at Christmas and decided to buy this package of blooming teas for her as well.  I had previously purchased a single blooming tea at my upscale grocer and when I tried it I found it to be delicious and aromatic and the blossom was large and beautiful.  I saved two of the packets of this Grosche tea to be served after Christmas dinner with dessert and split the other package between my Mother and Mother in law because it was sold out at Amazon.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!  The tea  was flavorless and the blossom like a pitiable piece of seaweed! Not at all like the one I purchased at my Grocer in Buffalo NY or the fine ones I tried when I was in Paris last spring.  I was a bit embarrassed at this lacklustre showing and I would not purchase from this Grosche company again.  I think the concept of these blooming teas is fabulous"

0;I love sampler packs and trying new kinds but with this half were not even coffee instead a lot of spiced cider and hot chocolate which we do NOT drink!! Very unhappy.<br />Its even more annoying than I first noticed 12 are grove square ciders or cocoas! 4 are grove square cappunccino  and only 6 are good coffees.  Grove Square for me is the worst its always too sweet and its cheap in the stores. This assortment is way overpriced and so not worth it And I only recieved 22 not 24
0;"""Description states:  This is a variety of flavored coffee . . .This variety sampler includes only flavored caffeinated coffee.   So I ordered two for 48 K-cups of  flavored caffeinated coffee  and received 9 ciders"
0;This is a joke!!  I have never been so mad as I am right now writing this.  Not only is the coffee a big joke the way they shipped it is as well.  The assortment in this is ridiculous.  The majority of the coffee is french vanilla.  And hopefully we will like spicy eggnog and kahlua because those make up pretty much the rest of the coffee.  This looks like somebody threw in the coffee they didn't like into a box and sent it to the sucker who was stupid enough to buy it.  I am not usually this brutall with reviews but this angers me.  The coffee was in a brown paper bag and thrown in a box to ship.  If I could return this I would but this is not a purchase that can be returned. How sad this is.
0;"""What we were hoping for:<br /><br />Something a little more like the picture.

0;I shop thru Amazon A LOT and I am totally surprised that they would deal with a vendor like this.  Variety?????what variety???  I received this today and just could not believe the lack of variety.  Mostly Green Mountain cups....and 4 or 5 of the same flavor.  None of the flavors that I was looking forward to trying.  I will NOT be ordering k-cups from this vendor EVER again!
0;Received 5 of 1 flavor 4 of another 3 of another 2 of 3 others and only 1 of the other 6. I ordered 2 bags of 24 so i got 10 of the one i did not like. 9 of them went in the trash. You should send 2 of each  so there is an equal sampling. It seems like i was sent what you had the most of and needed to get rid of.
0;I bought this for my husband and was excited to find a flavored sample pack for him to try a variety before buying an entire box. When they arrived I was very disappointed to see that 18 out of 24 of them where not a flavored coffee but just plain regular coffee.  Then the remaining 6 where the same to flavors. I'm very disappointed and will deff be sending them back and getting a refund. I just wish I would read the reviews before buying.

0;I usually don't write product reviews but I decided that it was necessary this time. I've ordered this coffee sampler several times and the last 2 times I have been disappointed with the variety that I have received.  In both orders I received over a third of the k-cup flavors in hazelnut. I like hazelnut but I thought the idea of a coffee sampler was to get a variety of flavors. I will not be ordering this sampler again!
0;EXTREMELY disappointed!  I received 15 decaf coffees!  9 were Hazelnut decaf and 6 were French vanilla decaf.  I didn't order a decaf selection.  The selection is horrible.  I will never order this again.
0;I received 4 of these and they were simply an assortment of k-cups thrown into a brown paper lunch bag. This is particularly annoying for me as I use the k-cup rack which is specifically designed for the 24-count boxes.
0;I love coffee & I love my Keurig coffee maker. What I don't love is when you order coffee and you are sent mostly tea & cappuccino. It would be ok if some tea was sent with the coffee but that was not the case. I will not be ordering this again
0;I ordered this item as a gift for my daughter who had received a Keurig brewer for Christmas. The cups arrived partially opened and with holes in them. She said about 50% of the cups were not usable. This was not a shipping problem but had to have come from the factory like that. She was disappointed and so was I.
0;"""Ordered the 34 count and it was Extremely disappointing.  I expected to get at least one-two of every flavor shown on the 34 count sampler.  I would say about 24 are either Hazelnut or Vanilla.  Which are last I need since I buy Hazelnut by the 80 pack carton at BJs.  No Mudslide"

0;We sent a case to a couple of young people living on a tight budget -- I thought some canned protein would be a nice addition to thier pantry.  I offered to send another case and was told 'no thanks'.  They report that this product filled with small bones and cartiledge meaning there was wasted product and time wasted in cleaning it.
0;I placed the order on 12/6/09 and here it is 12/31/09 and I never received it. When I tried to track the order UPS does not have the tracking number in the database cause the number is bogus. for some reason I cannot contact the merchant to tell them what's going on so I have to dispute the charge on my credit card.

0;I grew up in Philly and NY and traveled extensively. Dined in so many excellent Chinese restaurants in every major U.S.city. I love really Hot Chinese mustard and ordered this product. It is awful. The worst! Thick paste NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING MILDLY HOT. Gulden's brown mustard is better. Save your money. THIS IS REALLY AWFUL. You will throw it out along with your money! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. The only thing authentic about this product is the label.
0;I was excited to try this flavored coffee and I have drank Gevalia coffees for over 12 years and love their Traditional Roast and the limited edition Royal Vinter varieties. When I opened this one I noticed the overwhelming artificial smell of the product and read on the box that the flavors were indeed artificial!<br />I brewed a pot of coffee and tried it with my daughter and we both disliked the smell and the taste was disgusting and a strong aftertaste followed. I could not taste chocolate and even adding pumpkin spice creamer did not disguise the awful flavor.<br />A few nights later I made a pot of this coffee for my husband and I to drink because I wanted his opinion. He also hated it and said to NEVER brew it again.  This product was a good idea but the ingredients make it unpalatable and if you are going to add chocolate then make sure it is REAL so the flavor is right.
0;These are so tiny I would be embarrassed to give them as a gift. Maybe 2 tablespoons jam per jar. They wouldn't even sell at the flea market for a dollar for the 4 pack. I had hoped to get some of my money back. One star is too much.
0;Last year I had another Tur-duc-ken and it was great.  This year our market brought these in and I will never buy one again. The instructions state to cook 3 hours and 40 minutes frozen.  It took over 2 hours more than that (which I could have lived with) and when we took it out it was so dry on the outside and still raw in the middle. Trust me my market has heard several complaints this year.<br />T from PA

0;$25 for ONE pack?!? The fault is mine for not reading the description more closely but for $25 I assumed I was getting a pack of 3 like usual when I order from amazon. Needless to say I will be returning the item and will be more careful when ordering in the future. Shame on this seller for jacking up the price to a ridiculous amount!

That's not even mentioning that it has soybean products in it.

And it has Autolyzed Yeast Extract which is another name for the infamous neurotoxin....MSG (monosodium glutamate). I don't understand why this well known company has to use dangerous ingredients when there are so many substitutes that will not destroy our populations health.  Is it purely because it's so much cheaper to use these dangerous"

0;I would  never buy flavored coffee of this kine any more. The coffee itself tastes awful. The flavor is very artificial. Now I  figured that no company will use high quality beans to make flavored coffee. Just like Jasmine tea is made of worse quality tea leaves because it is just for flavor. I am done with flavored coffee.

0;"""What a disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I bought peaches and strawberries flavor in my grocery store because they were on sale. I noticed they were the most expensive ones there so I figured that must be the best there is. How wrong was I. First thing that hit me was how sweet they were. I could barely finish eating. Then I looked at the label and found far too many artificial ingredients. But that's not all. I noticed that peaches and strawberries are strangely similar in taste and shape. After reading a label I found out that they do not even put real strawberries and peaches in the oatmeal. Can you believe that? The most expensive oatmeal on the market and no real fruit. What they do is they put artificially flavored apples in there. Company with such experience in oatmeal making can't afford to give its customers REAL FRUIT? What a shame. I will never buy any of their products. Never!. Oh just to compare what there is available on the market please visit Traders Joe. I found blueberry flavor with REAL blueberries"
0;This is my fourth order from Amazon for single serve cereals. I love the convenience of having a fresh bowl each time I open a new box. I usually consume about two to four a week so opening a large box is a waste since I don't like the stale taste.<br /><br />The order came in a very timely manner. The box was well packed and protected. The cereal fresh and tasty. I will order this again and again. Thanks Amazon.
0;$30 for 3lbs of candy. LMAO! This is so not worth $30. A 5lbs. bag of almost the same selection of candy runs 9.99. What makes this a $30??? A card board box with 80's printed on the front? Such a joke.

0;I'm so tired of false advertising on Amazon! And fake reviews! This stuff is mostly whey and a very small amount of cheddar and also contains two food dies!!! It's crap!! And your site advertising it as dried cheddar! I'm almost to the point of leaving Amazon for good!
0;"""I read another review of this product that stated that this product's first and main ingredient is whey.  Whey is a by-product of milk (remember that little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet eating her curds and whey).  Whey has a somewhat acidic taste that is rather crude.  Cheddar cheese is way down the line in terms of percentage quantity in this stuff.  I couldn't think of what this stuff tasted like until I read the other review.  It's taste does not resemble that of cheddar cheese.  I knew the product had an odd taste which I did not care for.  I just didn't realize what that taste was until I came across the other review.  There are no ingredients listed on the label.  Now I understand why most liked the product.  I assume because they are used to the taste of boxed macaroni and cheese products available in the grocery store with the orange/yellow powder in the packet inside the box.  And most have come to think of that taste as cheese.  Finer tastes however will reject this stuff"
0;I bought this product with the idea I would get a cheddar cheese powder.  It's not!!  It's mostly whey powder with very little cheese in it.  The cost of shipping is way to much and the stuff is crap.  I think Amazon is in violation of the law.  Nowhere do you find any ingredients of this food product.  Except for the shot of the front of the bag that says it's Cheddar Powder.  That's false advertising and against the laws put down by the FDA about food products.  Keep looking there is better out there.

The package is vague about ingredients and only states that  Each bag contains approximately 1/2 cup of pineapples.   That may be true"

And what's worse is that the product itself isn't as healthy as Planters wants you to believe it is. It's made with sugar and oil. The ingredients should be nothing but fruit and nuts to be really healthy.
0;My husband and I both used this Goji Berry freeze dried product. We didn't notice any increase in our energy levels while taking it.

0;"""I have enjoyed this tea for 25 years. Something changed at some point. Recently reading the ingredient list I noticed the second ingredient is  Natural Flavor .  What is it?  I wrote to the company and received a pat answer that it is a 'proprietary blend' and they can not divulge the actual ingredients except to your enquiring physician. It could be that it is just an ordinary flavor enhancing recipe  similar to MSG or it could be worse. Might our bodies think it unnatural?  Do they mean 'natural' as in from planet earth?  So I'll be giving up my favorite tea.<br />I think I am going to get some star anise"
0;"""The product description says:  Plantation 12X 15 Oz Blackstrap Molasses Unsl Organic Blackstrap Molasses. <br /><br />The problem is the item is not organic. Now I'm stuck with a whole case. I contacted Bangalla Organic and they insisted the case was organic despite not saying so on the label. They claimed they called the manufacturer to verify.<br /><br />The reality is that the Plantation molasses that is certified specifically says  certified by the Quality Assurance Internation(QAI.)  There is no certification on these bottles.<br /><br />It find it hilarious that the product description also says  (Note: This Product Description Is Informational Only.

0;"""If you like Ginger Snaps and always feel they are not powerful enough then these are likely for you.<br /><br />To me these are like a concentrated form of ginger snaps and its so potent I just can't eat them.<br /><br />It really reminds me of soap in its aftertaste.

I wa not pleased with these items.  Seller would only offer a percentage off on future purchase.  Shipping cost more than the candy.
0;"""The label says it's Watermelon and Strawberry but I did not taste either one of these flavors.  I did taste adulterated grape and apple and something  musty like .  There wasn't really any carbonation either. With the lack of a great flavor and at 140 Calories for this tiny little can of 8.3 ounces with 36 grams of carbs and 35 grams of sugar (albeit natural fruit sugars)"
0;"""This is just too sweet for me.  Cloying.  It's OK if you dilute it about half and half with plain seltzer.  And an 8.3 ounce can of this has as many calories as a twelve ounce Coke!  I don't buy the line that sweetness from juice is healthier than sweetness from high fructose corn syrup.  As far as my digestion is concerned"

0;"""I decided to try this  shredded jerky  because Buffalo Bills country cut jerky is really great and I kinda wanted the cans to put some of my country cut jerky into.  Well the cans are rather tiny and the jerky inside is very very salty.  It's not really shredded"
0;This product was not as expected.  It is a fuzzy product and is mostly dried fat.  I mean it looks like the stuff they would clean off the machines after a day of processing beef jerky.  I did not identify much meat in this stuff.  It is very salty as well.
0;This product is horrible and not as described. I love shreded beef jerky and that that's what I was getting but this is more junks of jerky mixed in with some shreded. I would not recommend this to anyone who actually wants shreded jerky because that's not what this is.
0;I eat this product all of the time.  These bags were in pristine condition but they are stale.  It's the first time I've purchased them in bulk and the first time I've eaten them stale.  Perhaps this is just a bad batch.  But don't order them from this particular seller.  There is a no return policy on it.
0;I've ordered this product in bulk before - my wife and I love using the French's recipes and have found that the Fried Onions are great on many different dishes - this time though the bags are STALE... completely uneatable and ruined the dinner I first used them on. No return policy is a major disappointment for this product as well - they are completely unusable.<br /><br />I will not buy this product again.
0;These treats are under investigation by the FDA! They have issued several warnings - over 2000 complaints of illness and 300 deaths are linked to these treats!

0;My husband and I LOVE maple candy like this (well usually) so I was really excited when I found it on Amazon. Though I would give us a little treat every couple months so I signed up for the 2 month auto shipment. The first shipment came really quickly but we were both totally disappointed! Maple candy usually melts in your mouth. Occasionally you'll come across a piece that is a little hard. This whole box was hard! You had to suck on it forever to get is soft enough to eat. Canceled the auto the next day.

0;"""If you even like this product...the bottle design doesn't allow one to effectively shake up the ingredients before pouring therefore you get all oil right off the top. I suggest pouring it into a bowl and whisking. It contains xanthan gum but it wasn't effective as an emulsifier. No one flavor stood out but I could taste the canola oil. I like tart and this isn't. With the sweetness of the fig"
0;This product is horrible.  It only leaves me with a bitter taste in my mouth that lasts for about 12 hours.  This was a collossal waste of time and money.  I will have to seek another sweetening alternative.
0;"""I picked up a box of Grove Square  single cup  coffee (medium roast) at Wal-Mart. I should have shaken the box and compared it to another brand and maybe I would have caught on before I left the store. At home when I took one of the cups out to put in my Keurig machine I shook the cup and was alarmed at the noise. Regular K-Cups don't make that much of a noise. I brewed one to test it and the coffee was just so-so.<br /><br />After the K-Cup cooled down"
0;"""Be aware if you buy this that it is INSTANT COFFEE. I purchased this at WalMart because the price was so much better than regular K-cups. I brought it home and tried it - awful coffee when you are expecting a cup of fresh brewed coffee.  I contacted Grove Square Customer service to c/o what appears to be deception but got no response. I also contacted Keurig and they did reply saying they were aware of the product and that Keurig was in  talks  with Grove Square about this since Grove Square apparently is not authorized to sell this coffee as a Kcup coffee and the coffee was NOT recommended by Keurig.  I feel if you pay >100$$ for a brewer it isn't to brew instant coffee. I too"
0;"""I don't know why anyone would want to buy (and therefore why any company would make) Keurig K-Cups with instant coffee in them. Is there a market for people who prefer the flavor of instant coffee? It doesn't make things quicker. Coffee still brews in under a minute"
0;Glad to see that Amazon has added (Instant Coffee) to the description.  It was not in the description when we purchased! We purchased because we thought it was a great value and were looking to save some money. We should have known...you get what you pay for! Won't buy it again!
0;"""This item is not worth any money. 1. The product recieved expired in March 2012 - 3 months ago. 2. I don't recall seeing in the description that this was instant coffee. 3. It took 10 days from the day ordered to arrive.<br />It is AWFUL - barely drinkable - which could be the expiration or the product. I have thrown out the remaining 35 k-cups. Spend the extra few bucks and get a medium worth drinking.<br />Honestly"
0;"""I just couldn't bring myself to drink another cup.  I picked up an 18 count box of Grove Square medium roast at my local Wal-Mart for around $7.98.  I should have paid more attention to the instant coffee notes on the box and taken that as a warning.  They really sold me on the k-cup for the dollar ratio and I was a sucker for it.  I like instant coffee"
0;I enjoy a variety of Keurig coffees.  This one is different!  The K-cup doesn't work the same.  The coffee comes out in the first ounce or two and then the rest is just water.  The coffee flavor is okay but it has the consistency of instant coffee.
0;This was the worst coffee product that I have ever purchased.  I knew something was wrong when I opened the product and realized how little the amount of coffee in the cup was.  This coffee could not even produce a drinkable 8 ounce cup of cofee. It tasted like hot water.  Steer clear of this product.
0;"""I have been buying K-cup coffee from Amazon for 2 years and have never been so unhappy with a product I would need to write feedback.  This is instant coffee and the taste is like water.  For anyone familiar with k_cups after the cup is brewed there are grinds still in the pod"
0;"""I wish I would have read these reviews before ordering.  There is a reason the price is so low.<br />This is instant coffee and it tastes like instant coffee.  You do not need a Keurig brewer to make it-just add it to hot water.<br />I am very disappointed"
0;"""You wil notice if you look carefully at the box that nowhere does it actually say K-cups. That word is a trademark and is only  used on products that are approved by Keurig. They should not be listed as such in the Amazon description--it is false advertising that is no different that calling a generic teenage girl doll a Barbie. The product says  For use by owners of Keurig cofffee makers.  That is a big red flag. There are also a number of these off-brand fakers at grocery stores. Avoid them."""
0;"""This is just instant coffee put in a k-cup. We made the mistake of buying this because it is SLIGHTLY cheaper. How a company can be this sneaky is absurd! They are much lighter in weight and upon brewing"

0;"""I tried this decaf and found it to be an pretty good. Thought I would give it a second try but when I went to order more it was out of stock. I called Jeremiah's Pick directly to find out about that. A rude detached phone sales person responded with a flat voiced response:  It's out of stock . I asked how long she thought it would be before they roasted more and had it back in stock and she said:  It's out of stock . So I was curious and asked her if it would ever be back in stock and she said:  it's out of stock . I asked one final question in hopes of finding out whether I would ever be able to get it again. I asked why they were out of stock. Was it a bean shortage"
0;"""I had an enormous hope for this  patent-pending  technology and was shocked to find that this product doesn't taste like anything.

0;When I used this Ham Base to make soup it left a scum layer that did not dissolve and I had to try and skim it off the soup.  I tried contacting the company twice before leaving this review and they never responded.  Don't waste your money on this product.
0;I can not recommend this tea. We usually drink pompadour/teekanne fennel tea but that has become more difficult to find so when we found this tea at a very low price we had to try it. What a waste of money. The tea was so bad that we threw away 118 of the 120 tea bags.

0;I eat a lot of sugar free and low carb food products and while most are an aquired taste this product is absolutely horrid.  It smells and tastes like a blend of furniture polish and an old ladies perfume.
0;I am used to other Russian Caravan blends which I find rich and complex with hints of that unique smoky quality of lapsang souchong. (Try Grace Rare Tea's excellent version for example.) I find Davidson's version to be simply an uninteresting black tea - very disappointing. The package I received also seems to be old which may explain the lower price.

0;Are you trying to NOT sell this item. This item can be purchased at most grocery stores for 1/3 that price and 1/4 that price at any decent asian market. I used to think Amazon was a place to get deals.
0;"""Seems a little suspicious that not ALL of the ingredients are listed here.  Do not be deceived.  There is ASPARTAME in this ginger.  Aspartame is a neurotoxin to the body and is extremely toxic.  If you have any sensitives to consuming poison"
0;I love spicy food and when I ordered these I was extremely disappointed at how non-spicy they were. Plus the noodles were too chunky for my taste. I am used to mamas thin noodles. These were just too chunky and pasty and not spicy.
0;"""This  Harissa  tastes like lightly spiced canned pasta sauce.  The only reason I purchased it is because I can't find Mustapha's Harissa anywhere else.  Hopefully they start making it again.  Till then"
0;The flavor was so gross that we couldn't even give this away if we tried. I did end up donating the boxes of this because it is such a foul flavor. The only way to even make it bearable was the Cinnabon creamer. This is an ambitious flavor that was not achieved.
0;"""Amazon is misleading their customers. The regular (list) price for this item is $3.99 for each 5 bar box. So list price for  30 boxes of 5 bars each or 150 bars total  is 30 x 3.99 = $119.70. and 80 percent off of the list price is $23.94. However amazon ships only 6 boxes of 5 bars. So they are over charging customers by 80 percent.  DO NOT TRUST amazon."""
0;I was seriously disappointed with this product!  Espresso should be dark and rich. This tasted more like an instant coffee.  I will stick with cafe la llave.  Gave the coffee away to the local food shelter
0;"""I really wanted to like this coffee. I wanted something that I could take to the office and use with my AeroPress coffee maker or use when I wanted a quick shot of espresso without grinding the beans. However"
0;I rated this one star to get your attention.  It is actually an excellent coffee if you use a drip coffee maker because it needs high temperature to bring out the flavor.  It is horrid when prepared at lower temperature as in a pump espresso machine.
0;I too am from Louisiana and make my own gumbo from scratch.<br />This mix is terrible.  A real disappointment.  The worst I've ever had.<br />Though I didn't try to make it with chicken stock (instructions call for water).<br />Has very bad taste.
0;"""I wish that the food companies would treat their customers with respect by not putting unhealthy ingredients in their products. These bouillon cubes contain not only an inordinate amount of sodium but MSG as well. And then as an added bonus they threw in some hydrogenated oil. WHAT are they thinking when they pump this garbage out and box it up? Hey Knorr - if we all end up too sick to work from eating this kind of so-called food"
0;"""I am slowly coming out of the worst ordeal after a very unrestful night as the result of eating Knorr's Mexican Rice. It was extremely high in sodium and I had to drink almost 12 glasses of water-to no avail. Even my sleeping pills did little to help me sleep. The label in the back of the package indicated it had only 670 milligram of sodium. Trust me"
0;"""I have already contacted the company that sells these and your company.  These dog chews are horrible!  I actually gagged when I opened the package.  They smell like rotten beef.  I didn't realize that they were made in another country either until I got them.  They are not fit to feed to a rat.  I am very upset about this and now trusting the companies you deal with.  You can see that I buy much from amazon"
0;"""Read the packages carefully before buying.  Cadet is known for  irradiating  their products.  That is not  all natural.   Our holistic vet advises to never feed irradiated or  high-pressure pasturised  products to animals.  It's not worth the risk and it definitely puts more toxic junk into their systems.<br /><br />Merrick is not great either.  They own their own rendering plant in TX.  Road kill"
0;This is NOT the one Alton Brown uses on his Foodtv Good Eats show.  I bought the real one he uses from another seller on here. Do a search for Alton Brown Salt Cellar and you will see the REAL one. Special box and packaging for the real one.
0;"""For something called  Endurance  the lid broke off the first time I hand washed it.  Very cheaply made in the hinge area with no way to repair the hinge pin.  I'm mystified as to how it was attached in the first place.  It's almost like it was glued.  I couldn't find any solder or a weld joint.<br /><br />To echo the some of the other reviews this is most definitely NOT the one used by Alton Brown. The lack of the vertical handle is a shortcoming when you try to open it one handed off of the counter."""
0;"""I put this on my wish list and luckily someone purchased it for me. I don't want to sound ungrateful at all but this is not at all what I had expected it to be. It is NOT the same as the one Alton Brown uses on his show. Which is hard to see that from the photos (when I first looked at the item there was only 1 photo)"
0;This Carbona Stain Devil is great..it was the people I ordered it from that were no too good.  Like I paid for a 6 pk and received one.  Then I called them and they were more than polite to me on the phone.  I was so happy I called because they said they were going to send the other 5 out right away.  I received one again.  I did not call back this time.  But I'll remember who they are and NEVER Order Carbona from them again.  Lesson learned.
0;I bought these Pack of 3 in June. It was grate taste.<br />After three months I subscribe to renew every quarter.<br />Some days ago I received new Pack of 3 Taster's Choice FRENCH Roast.<br />But new one has much different taste. In reality this coffee IS NOT smelling at all.<br />I will unsubscribe.
0;I ordered a 3 pack of TASTERS CHOICE FRENCH ROAST Instant Coffee and got 3 pack of TASTERS CHOICE DECAFF instant coffee.  I have been ordering on Amazon for a long time and suddenly I have now received two orders that were NOT WHAT I ORDERED.<br />What's going on guys?
0;I am Brazilian and have always loved anise seed tea.  This tea is dirt and makes tea that tastes like muddy water! Now I am stuck with this stuff and don't know what to do with it!  I don't know where I can find good anise tean in the United States.  When I first came to the U.S. there was a source but they went out of business.
0;"""Taco Bell's Bold and Creamy Jalapeno Sauce's taste was very unappealing to me.  I also didn't like the color of the product.  It doesn't look appetizing.  It has a strong vinegar taste with a little hot pepper and spicy tang.  I really didn't like it"
0;"""This is not going to be a review that will go in-depth.  The bottom line is that I love jalapeno anything and this was not 'jalapeno' flavored in the least bit.  The sauce is very creamy and just too bland for my tastes.  DO I love spicy and hot flavored anything?  Yes!  This sauce did not even provide a bit of a kick.  Nothing.  Just creamy awkward tasting blandness.  To add insult to injury Amazon decided to ship me expired products.  Yes... expired.  I took the risk and still tried it but I still found the taste to be bland.  I am hoping that my taste was off because it was not used by the :best if used by date:"
0;I was really excited when I seen this Jalapeno sauce at the grocery store because I love taco bell's quesadilla's but I was very disappointed when I made my own Quesadilla at home with it because it doesn't taste anything like the jalapeno sauce that Taco Bell uses on theirs. I has a mild kick to it which I like but it has a funny  smell and taste. Not a funny after taste but an actually funny taste when you first taste it.. I would not rebuy it. It was only $1.50 so it was worth it to try..
0;"""Let me just kick this off by saying that I like most of what Taco Bell has to offer in their fast food restaurants. I can't stand their red sauce that comes on some of the burritos but that is about it.<br /><br />How are you going to know if your taste matches mine? Let me list a few like and dislikes and that may help you decide if this sauce is for you.<br /><br />Like: Mustard"
0;I was sent one bag of Texas Hold 'Ems instead of 12 that i ordered and paid for. I was charged $113.00 for one bag. The 11 bags that were later sent to me were horrible. The lamb treats were all broken into tiny tiny pieces in the bag. I have ordered this product from other companies and never had a problem. The lamb treats were a decent size fillet.<br />I would not order from this company again.

0;I was looking forward to receiving this hot milk chocolate in the mail but should have known better. The half cup that I was able to drink tasted more like hot instant milk with a hint of some other flavor (I didn't recognize it as chocolate.) I would not recommend it.
0;We were given a sample box of Cafe Escapes (4 count) with our Keurig brewer.  They do not taste good.  They have a very strong chemical / plastic taste and the chocolate flavor is difficult to distinguish but it does taste artificial.  It had a decent mouth feel and brewed well but the taste is not worth it.
0;"""These were terrible. I do not recommend at all. Has a very artificial taste. Nasty after taste. I thought it was old or nasty water in the machine since all other k-cups i have used have come out at least reasonably. Was not the water"
0;"""TOO SWEET (from artificial sweetner) and not milky/rich enough!!!!<br /><br />Luckily I had gotten a whole box as a complimentary gift from facebook or something else.  I suppose for people who like sugar substitute"
0;Sardines had strange brown and yellow spots on them.  There was an off putting metallic after taste.  Caught in Cali but processed in Vietnam compromising freshness.  Still in search of quality sardines for the Omegas.
0;"""item.  Reasonably priced for such a large quantity and with Prime no shipping costs.  I have not had a chance to use any of the garlic yet but I know the quality of Tone's products.  I am very much looking forward to using this product.  I have now used this product"
0;The container for this is very sloppy.  I would not mess with buying this product.  The formula is overpriced.  Check out Walmart's brand formula Parents Choice.  This formula is similar to Similac Advance.  My pediatrician recommended this brand and my friends use it also.  Seriously I wouldn't spend your hard earned money on a formula that is seriously overpriced.
0;"""Was glad to find the product and although I had to buy a ton of them...no problem. The problem was that whoever did the packaging just threw them in a box and no paper or cushion or styrofoam bits. One came broken and oozed all over the box"
0;"""I purchased a four pack of the teriyaki flavor and I could only eat 2 pieces.  The jerky was so dry and had a burnt taste to it.  This jerky was the worst that I have ever had.  I was quite surprised of the poor quality because of the favorable reviews.  Maybe I just got a bad batch"
0;"""Wish I'd known before I bought this.  Hydrogenated  means partially hydrogenated means  huge trans fats  but atleast now I've learned something. I had assumed it meant  fully hydrogenated  which is an entirely different thing. Never eaten anything with huge amounts of trans fats and now I know what that's like... I won't say what happened but I won't be touching this stuff again. Worse than paying more for something else at the grocery store. Too bad I ordered another order before I figured out why I was getting so sick. I will cancel my subscription."""
0;"""So we've purchased this product (not from Amazon)for our Scottish Terrier  and he ate them with gusto.

0;The package I ordered for my 78 year old mother had already been opened and 12 cups were missing. This happened both with the hot chocolate (6 cups missing) and the decaf order (6 cups missing)<br /><br />Will probably not order from this group again.
0;"""I sent this item to a friend as a gift. I composed a gift card to be sent with it. I did not hear from my friend that the truffles were received. I tracked the shipping and found they had been delivered to their porch. The truffle company had not sent the gift card along so my friend had no idea who had sent the chocolates. She called members of her family to ask them if they had sent her a gift. Embarrassing! And then I had to phone her to see if she had received the chocolates!!! This took time"
0;We thought we were buying Donckel Belgian Truffles and instead we got Truffettes de France which are not nearly as good. The truffettes have 5 mg of cholestrol while the Donckels have none.  The Donckels have a very light texture and melt in your mouth while the Truffettes are heavy more like a fudge than a truffle.  I believe that the Truffettes manufacturer is preying on buyers like me by closely imitating their packaging. WE thought we were buying one product and got something else.  The products are not even close inflavor or texture.

0;I look forward to buying these every year and what a let down this years shipment was.These make a very weak cup of coffee with just a faint hint of pumpkin spice. Shame on you Green Mountain. Not up to the standards i thought your company had.
0;I just cant believe.  It is just like plain water almost!<br /><br />The one last year was just great and I hoping the same.<br /><br />Shame for selling such a product.  Will be asking Amazon for a refund.
0;I bought a box of this so called coffee and it was so bad I threw out all but the 6 cups I tried to drink.  At first I thought my Keurig was going out but not so.  This coffee was so weak it was little more than slightly off-color water.  Maybe it was a bad box.  I don't know but can't waste any more money finding out.
0;"""I tried this flavor 2 years ago right after I bought my first Keurig machine.  It had a good smell but the taste was completely awful.  It was so heavy on the cloves that it obliterated everything else.  The pumpkin flavor was barely discernable as was any other spice...where are the cinnamon and nutmeg flavors?  There was nothing I could do to make this kcup palatable.  I tried flavored creamers"
0;I am very disappointed in these K cups.  I made it using the smallest cup size and it still tastes like hot water.  I guess if I added cream and sugar it would taste like sweet creamy hot water.  I am mad that I bought the 50 pack and it is not returnable.  They are going in the trash.
0;"""I purchased a large box of this Pumpkin Spice coffee for my family without first trying a sample and not one of us said anything more positive than  it has spices I do not like .  Most of the comments were   I hate this stuff"
0;I always enjoy Starbucks PSL's so I thought this was going to be a great buy.  Mistake I made is I bought a lot of this.  Did not like the taste at all.  Seems like its too much spice not enough pumpkin.  I have been adding flavored creamers to this coffee just so they don't go to waste.  It helps.  Won't buy this again and won't buy so many without tasting  first.  My bad.
0;"""My wife recently purchased a pack of these K-Cups.  First my wife tried one on the normal cup setting (the one in the middle) and the cup that was produced tasted like hot water with just a hint that there might be some flavor.  So she turned it all the way down to the smallest cup with the same result.  My wife did try one more again a few days later and got a good cup so I went for it.  And again the same result"
0;They added aspartame and ruined a great gum. I will not risk the health controversies for myself nor my family. Goodbye Wrigleys. You lost a long time customer. I no longer buy your gum because of what you did. You ruined what was once great.
0;You can't add any creamer (liquid or dry) because it curdles.  The taste without the creamer is terrible (IMO).  I enjoy Liptons other flavors of green tea but after a trying to force down a few cups of this I threw the remaining 18 away.  Judging by the other reviews it must be me.
0;I ordered this product and had it shipped in one day because I needed it for the weekend for a special event. To my surprise the product turned out to be date molasses instead of grape which will not work. Very poor service

0;Read the description carefully.  Made by Spangler - Made in Mexico.<br />I almost was fooled.  Spangler used to be made in USA<br />Guess Mexico is better than China.  CVS candy canes  are made in China.
0;"""Bought several 18 oz bags at Costco.  The taste is superb and no one should buy this product until they fix the quality control problems.  Popcorn is one of the top causes of broken teeth so Angie's may cost you a root canal and crown becasue of the excessive amount of unpopped corn that you may accidentally chomp down on.<br /><br />The unpops are throughout the bag - not just at the bottom.

0;I ordered these from the warehouse. I understand that most items are approaching their sell date. However these are from 2011. They were also very melted so you could not identify which sports ball they were. This was not a good purchase. I do not recommend these to anyone.

0;why has the price for this product almost doubled since March of this year.  This is ridiculous.  It used to be $65 for 25 pounds and now it's $101.  What kind of business practice is that?<br />It's pretty good but not that good!

So I figure I'll save a couple bucks and go with National Pet Pharmacy.  What I didn't realize was that they have this little trick where they put their 20 pound bag up at a similar price that other sellers sell their 40 pound bag for.  So they price their 20 pound bag (which they hope people will mistake for a 40 pound bag - like me"
0;This soup sounded delicious and nutritious until I read that it contained so much monosodium glutamate.  Why would manufacturers deliberately try to poison their customers!  Monosodium glutamate is a well known and studied NEUROTOXIN!  Can't they just use REAL FOOD flavorings to keep the product tasty and well received by all consumers?  I really wanted to try this soup since it looked terrific and most ingredients were excellent but I won't buy it until they stop using MSG like it's salt and pepper.

0;Sorry folks. My healthy (regularly vet-checked) indoor-only Himalayan gives this food a definite thumbs-down. She ate it happily enough but it was Apparently too rich (or something) for her. She had extreme diarrhea as a result of eating just two teaspoons of this food. It was so bad we had to wash her rear end to get it all off. I'll be donating the rest to a shelter and hope other kitties fare better with it. We'll stick to her regular fish-variety Petite Cuisine and Fancy Feast Appetizers.

Not at all pleasant.<br /><br />I'm not usually that picky when it comes to my food or drink"

0;I have always been a fan or Rao's Marinara sauce and willing to shell out the premium price of $7-$9 a bottle. However of late (I would say within the last 3-6 months) the recipe or process has apparently changed. The sauce is no where near as fresh tasting as it once was. The sauce is now more homogenized and bland to the point that I will no longer shell out the premium price for a product that is no better then sauces selling for $2 a bottle. It is sad that the company has cut corners in the way that they have (perhaps they have expanded production and are using a new supplier). I hope that they return to their original recipe or drop the new manufacturing source.<br /><br />Considering the price point and the average quality I would rate the current product as poor.<br /><br />I would be interested in other opinions.<br /><br />Sign me an unhappy customer.

0;I was very disappointed with the delivery of the chocolates. I ordered them on July 31 and they did not come until August 12 (after their expected delivery date). I also did not like the fact that they never sent any email confirmation about the order or when they were being shipped.

0;This stuff is awful.  Great termite food.<br />Product of China!<br />Amazon should be ashamed to offer it as nutrient.<br />I threw it away (all packs) rather than by chance have another human eat some.<br />I've had good soy nuts.

0;I purchased the capsule via amazon as I do most of my purchases this way.  These ended up coming from is isreal. They were send in a flimsy bag and everything was crushed and unusable AND I waited 7 weeks for them.  Not acceptable and I can not believe this seller is on amazon.

0;Over priced for what you can get from the manufacturer directly and also have a much larger selection of different coffees - as well as the new chocolate flavor - do not understand why anyone would buy USED coffee - by its nature coffee cannot be USED
0;Go to nespresso's website immediately. The capsules are .57 a piece instead of .80.  I cant believe that amazon cant get a better deal on these capsules. The nespresso website has a huge variety. Love the coffee....cant believe the amazon prices.

0;I was not able to eat all of these little fruit gems. Unfortunately science has not yet come up with a good substitute for real sugar in the baking or other heated process. Natural sugar is a binding agent and determines not only the consistency of a product but also the taste. The slices are a good effort but just eat a real one if you need a taste of something sweet and adjust your meal intake.
0;I ordered these thinking I would like them because they were given the thumbs up on the Dr. Oz show. Wrong. They are terrible and you can't return them. Make sure you taste them yourself before you order...
0;I thought this sounded ok base don reviews.  I love sushi and thought this would make a nice healthy snack.. I almost threw up when I tasted this.  I cant even pawn it off on any friends.  Now stuck with many packs of this.  Maybe its acquired but I won't be attempting to acquire that taste again.
0;When this went on sale I decided to give it a try after reading all of the positive reviews. Everyone in my family tried them at different times and we all agree that they are awful. We could not even believe it was considered food by other people. One of the worst things I have ever tried.

0;I use the Goita Chitosuma Yuzu juice and I thought I'd give this a try because you get double the amount for the dollar. Well ... no you don't. It's diluted -- weaker than the Goita. I had to use 3 times as much to put in my ice water. That makes it more expensive in the long run. The Goita is higher concentrate and one can use 1/3 (or less) as much for the same effect. Either way - it's all better than lemon!
0;My husband and I were excited to try these and put them in Christmas gifts for all our family before trying any. Turns out they are absolutely terrible. They should not be sold as food. My husband was nauseous for about 24 hours after tasting it. Last night I had to open up all the gifts and take them back out so as not to destroy Christmas. I hope someone pulls this product soon.

0;"""The LorAnn pistachio flavoring oil was purchased for baking cakes and making frostings. There is a scant semblance of pistachio in this product and adding more than a few drops completely transforms quality ingredients into noxious"
0;Thought I was getting a deal but when you factor in the high handling charge it's actually a lot more expensive than buying locally. My own stupid fault for for hitting 'Place Order' without really paying attention. Easy to sell product below market when you charge over three times the sale price for s&h. Lesson learned.
0;I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT FOR MY CAT WHO ADORES GRASS AFTER HIS DINNER EVERY NIGHT.  IT ONLY PARTLY CAME UP AND DID NOT REMAIN FOR MORE THAN 3 DAYS.  I HAVE ORDERED MANY KINDS OF GRASS AND THIS ONE IS ONE OF THE WORST.

0;Sorry I ate this... the tast is mediocre at best and is loaded with an unimaginable amount of salt.  The portion of the packet is barely enough to satisfy yet is packed with 425 calories and 36 grams of fat.  I would not recommend this or any other dish offered by Indian Kitchen.
0;"""I HAVE PURCHASED MANY INDIAN FOOD PRODUCTS ON AMAZON. I HAVE TRIED ALL AVAILABLE BRANDS AND I ATE INDIAN FOOD SINCE I WAS 10 YEARS OF AGE.<br />I JUST PREPARED KITCHENS OF INDIA PALEK PANEER. THE AWFUL SMELL OF BURNING RUBBER WAS OVERWHELMING"
0;"""I received this product today. It was going to be a gift for my office staff. All of the pears were bruised and fruit looked like something I could have purchased from the grocery store myself for half the price.  There were no blocks of cheese"

0;I used to buy a bag of these like every couple of months for my two mini poodles... I loved these because they make their breath smell better and good for oral health. But on one  particular occasion I gave them each one and all of a sudden Mischa(my 2 year old poodle about 7/8 pounds)  starts jumping around hysterically and at first I didn't really pay attention to her I thought she was just excited but after a few seconds I knew something was wrong. She had one of these denta stix lodged in the roof of her mouth between the opposite sides of her teeth.. So I had to dig it out of her mouth... It was a very scary experience... Her mouth was bleeding a little from it being stuck in there. I don't know if I purchased a pack that was expired or if it had gotten stale... I have no idea but that was warning enough and I knew from then on I would not be purchasing any of those denta sticks again. Before this incident I loved denta stix but I was always uneasy about how hard they are but I know they are supposed to be like that in order to keep their teeth clean... But.. It scared the crap out of me and my little Mischa. It is weird because Pineapple ( my male mini poodle who is about 8 pounds and 3 yrs) has never had that happen to him when he has dentastix... But I just wanted to let you all know.. Just in case.. Better to be safe than sorry.

0;You will be disapointed in this sauce its tabasco with sweet barbeque sauce mixed with water.... really let down when my friend bought it over for some chicken. I laughed when he said be careful... on a heat scale i would give a 6 right below temporary insanity sauce... if you want hot don't spend money on this product unless you like sweet vinegar. =P
0;I paid about 20.00 for this stuff shipped and man what a joke.  its like a bunch of sugar taste then a slightly hot pepper taste.  ive had basic habanero sauces waaaay hotter.  i just cannot believe it uses ghost pepper.  i feel ripped off honestly...
0;Although the dogs seemd to like them I was unimpressed. They appeared to look like dried pieces of wood and there were only 5 or 6 pieces in the bag. The product looked like pencil erasers. I only purchased this item as I needed to bring my total up to $25 to get free shipping on another product I ordered. Will not purchase again.
0;There have been multiple FDA warnings about these treats made in China.  My golden retriever died of renal failure after we gave him the chicken jerky treats from the same company.  Please don't take the chance of harming your pet.
0;"""I am disappointed because the company stopped making the brand I like. They only make the new version now which give a totally different taste then the old version. The company I ordered from was very nice about it refunding my money minus the shipping and handling charges. They even let me keep the product they sent. However"
0;"""The smell the previous reviewer couldn't place is burning rubber. It smells just like when you burn out a belt on a vacuum cleaner.  Once we finally got the kitchen aired out and the microwave clear of most of the stink of steel-belted radials"

0;I enjoy tasting various gourmet chocolates from around the world.  This product is apparently from Spain.  This is a disgrace.  Absolute awful texture (it seemed to get worse the more I chewed it) and extremely bland flavor.  One bite and I was done.  I am not going to ingest more calories on something so terrible.
0;"""And I mainly ate the first half cause the hazelnuts were pretty good. Hated seems harsh but I couldn't bring myself to eat the whole thing which is rare for chocolate :). I think the main problem is that they use  chocolate liquor  insted of cocoa which gives it a very bland taste and texture."""
0;This was the worst packaged taffy I ever bought. More than half of this tub filled with Turkish taffy had problems with the wrappers sticking . You would have to eat the paper with the taffy. Very poorly wrapped. Paper partially comes off.
0;"""I love noodle and had many different types ranging from a cheap .50cents a bag up to a $5.00 per serving and I must say this one the winner of  worse noodle  I ever had! I bought a pack of 8 in April and still got 7 left. I don't know what to do with it. This noodle has no flavors what so ever"
0;"""This  ham  was terrible. It was so hard pressed an electric knife nor meat slicer would cut it. It was a bad choice for a true Smithfield ham.  If you are thinking about serving it for a dinner or making ham rolls don't bother!  The only thing it is good for is seasoning a pot of beans and there are much cheaper options for that purpose."""
0;I used to eat Marmitte when I lived in England. It is a salty and very tasty paste and it is absolutely delicious on toast with butter. Almost impossible to find it in America except on Amazon or in some gourmet stores or health stores like Whole food Market. The one I received 2 days ago had neither the usual interior seal or the plastic seal that normally cover the jar. I am sending it back!! So disappointing!!
0;the after taste was slightly different.... I did not like it.....maybe it is something in the cereal that is artificial....don't know...will not buy anymore of it....  Quaker high fiber cinnamon swirl.....am returning it to the grocery store..... package has 2013 date on it.... that means that it is fresh... but the aftertaste is not good....
0;I have spent thousands of dollars on Amazon over the years and am a faithful customer.  I love reading the reviews and often check them before making a purchase. I have never posted a review until now.  I had a subscription for the Think Thin Chocolate brownie crunch bar until Amazon lost that account for whatever reason.  I switched over to a subscription for the dark chocolate bar...I just ate it (had to force myself to finish it). It tastes SOOOOOO bad and leaves a chemical after-taste.  I don't know how anyone can think this tastes good???? I am now stuck with three boxes of this junk that my dogs don't even want to eat.  I just canceled my subscription and will now have to trek to Trader Joes to get my chocolate brownie crunch bars!
0;"""I have not tried these but I gave them a poor rating because of false advertising.  They claim to be sugar free but they are far from it.  Maltitol is a sugar which is identical in properties to sucrose (table sugar).  The only difference is that Maltitol is only about 80% as sweet as sucrose.  No matter how they are marketing this thing"
0;I have three jack russells and bought these for them as I have one with allergies. I bought them in the pet store for $4.99 each. What a waste of money. 2 of them have been puking all night long. Not only a waste of money but stress for the poor dogs with belly aches!!!!!! I don't know if I got a bad product or if because they ate the whole hedgehog that their stomachs can't handle it. I am so very very disappointed in this product and will not be purchasing them again!
0;I just ordered this fudge.  It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try.  I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge.  I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks.  I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite.  Can't wait.
0;" ""1/3 less salt  is more of a gimmick than a health benefit. How about 1/3 of the salt?! I miss the unsalted seeds my mom bought @ any grocery store in the 1980's.  We have turned into such a salt/sugar/fat craving country. Uggh!"""
0;I love peaches and I am willing to pay higher prices for healthy snacks.  These had the higher price but they did not taste like peaches at all.  Since I could not return them I gave them to someone but I don't know if they ate them or not.  Will know better next time.
0;When you order a two-pound box you expect two pounds.  This is only 25 ounces. You should provide more product or explain up front that in your world 2 pounds is only 25 ounces.  Packaging doesn't count in my opinion.
0;This has to be one of the most disgusting products I have tasted. If you are on the Atkins or low carb diet it is NOT truly low carb. The nutrition information was deceptive and when I tried to return the product (unopened) the return policy does not allow for returns. I had to throw the 6 bottles away. Avoid this product at all costs! You can buy a ZERO carb maple syrup at any grocery store. Do not be fooled by this company.

I guess I didn't read this one carefully enough.  I can't even believe amazon would sell one pouch much less at this price.  Of course"
0;I was so surprised and happy.  I was able to roll the sushi the first time I tried.  I was then so disappointed.  We couldn't eat it.  The nori was so fishy tasting it overpowered everything else.  Had to throw my perfectly rolled sushi away.

0;I was really hoping this muffin mix would work out well but they are grainy with a terrible after taste. I ended up making my own from scratch that were far superior to the mix. I threw the  Namaste muffins in the trash.
0;This is disscusting nasty and it even looks unappeling to me.  none of my friends even liked it. It tastes like sweet and sour but nasty at the same time not at all like chinese food.  its spicy and good for about one to two seconds.  then the tase over cmes your mouth whith such bad taste its hard to describe.  ewwwww is all i can say what a wase of molecules on the earth i dont even know who thought of this stupoid ass idea.  i have no clue whay i even bought it in the first place.  all i can say is DONT BUT THIS GUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;ARE YOU INSANE?????????? Don't get me wrong the coffee itself is wonderful and I would love to get my hands on some more but This PRICE GOUGING is TOO MUCH and enough to have me waiting until Christmas 2012!
0;My store pet supplies plus was out so i thought i would buy them on line. They are the same product same item number but were different. they are twice as thick as the ones i buy in the store. both bags were the same and my dog only likes the thin ones. not sure why the ones i buy from the pet shop are thinner. They are the exact same things  wasted my money.
0;It is that taste... the taste of what a smelly foot  smells like with the twang of nachos... but bad nachos. Look I commend people for trying to say it's spicy but it really isn't. It's also not a taste that a normal person should be eating. Look if you lack tastebuds this popcorn is for you. However if  you want cheesey goodness on your popcorn... heat up actual cheese and pour it over your popcorn.
0;"""I love ordering from Amazon but the company this my order shipped this prodcut from is horrible..

The compnay is requesting I send them pictures of my package"
0;"""Normally I don't take the time to review food products I buy but this product was ABSOLUTELY GROSS.  The noodles tasted mushy and overcooked and the sauce and toppings were abysmal.  Maybe I have higher standards for asian food but the sauce is overwhelmingly and sickenly sweet (and thats just adding a little over half of the bic packet they give you)"
0;"""I wanted to try this as an alternative to the typical ramen cup or bowl of noodles and was expecting a premium alternative looking at the price. I tried it and was not impressed at all. It's basically instead of a dry noodle product partially hydrated and instead of a powered sauce"
0;"""This product has an absolutely horrible taste!  It doesn't taste anything like lemonade and has only a vague artificial strawberry taste.  The predominant taste though is this weird artificial tart/bitter taste.  Even after adding extra sugar"
0;"""My dogs don't like charlie bear treats anymore. Recently since early 2011 the color and smell of these little treats as well as the texture (they are harder) seems changed. Maybe this is why my dogs turn up their noses at them now. Has anyone else experienced this? I wonder sometimes if the liver has been left out? if the product has changed and dogs don't like it anymore I guess we won't buy it anymore"
0;"""These would be fine training treats for dogs that aren't allergic to wheat except that they contain garlic powder. I won't risk feeding my dog a treat that could cause anemia. Most sources agree that there is a risk that dogs will develop hemolytic anemia after consuming onion or garlic.  Given that"
0;Have never liked gum paste or fondant but decided to try this for a special project.  It rolled okay but the smell and taste were overbearingly strong with vanilla.  Won't order it or any other gum paste product or fondant product again.
0;"""I just got this order in.. this particular brand or batch or whatever did not taste very good. It was much too bitter and less  bright  tasting than other preserved lemons I have had. Kind of disappointed"
0;"""First the jar came and part of the liquid had leaked into the packaging. This seems to be common with the product. But it seemed ok so I use it. What an awful fake lemon flavor reminded me of country time lemonade. Just nasty. Let me be clear I don't think that the leaky liquid issue had anything to do with the horrible taste of the product otherwise I would have just sent it back. I saw all the positive reviews"
0;"""When my jar of preserved lemons arrived I wasn't sure what to do.  The lid on the jar was unscrewed and most of the liquid had spilled into the packaging.  How could that happen?  We thought the lemons looked mushy and smelled pungent (like cleaning fluid) but we tried them anyway.  Big Mistake! Our Moroccan chicken was ruined.  We threw the whole thing away"
0;This Virgil's Black Cherry creme soda drink tastes exactly like cherry cough syrup. Horribly over sweetened & over flavored by a factor of Ten. This beverage is positively undrinkable. I unfortunately bought a case of it. It is positively sickening. One swallow is more than enough. I'll have to pour the 24 bottles down the drain because these are unusable unless someone wants to pour it over ice cream & use it as a cherry syrup. Perhaps some grade school child might be able to tolerate it. I love creme soda but this is absolutely horrible.<br /><br />Virgil's plain Creme soda isn't much better. It tastes like root beer instead of creme soda.<br /><br />There is a Hawaiian brand of creme soda with cane sugar which is wonderful. But only available in limited supplies. Waialua creme soda. Be sure to spell it CREME not cream. Otherwise it wont come up. It is only available at limited times in limited quantities on this site but is the best I've ever tasted.
0;"""This item is the biggest piece of crap I have ever ordered from Amazon!!  Then I find out you cannot return the item.  The gift basket the item came in was broken.  The  gift wrapping  that I paid extra for was basically a velvet bag with the box in it.  What a joke.  Since I cannot return it I am paying off my Amazon.Com account and closing it!!!!  Buyers beware when ordering this item.  The only reason I gave it one star was because you could not list zero stars!!"""
0;"""I fell in love with this flavor - the original recipe.  I did the subscribe and save option to that I'd always have plenty on hand.  I had to cancel it and will not buy this again.  I don't know what they changed in the recipe"
0;"""I have been a fan of Gevalia's Swiss Hazelnut for about two years...however the new formula in the new packaging/logo from Tassimo is HORRENDOUS! The original formula had subtle hazelnut flavor that tasted like it was in the roast itself....the new tastes like they added a cheap shot of hazelnut syrup and a couple of vanilla shots to boot! This is nothing like the original"
0;I love vanilla milk and can't find the mix around where I live so I ordered it. I read somewhere that it is only made in New Mexico now and sure enough the writing on the package was all written in Spanish. That may or may not have anything to do with why I didn't like it.<br /><br />I think that this product tasted like vanilla slimfast shakes. I cannot stand slimfast so I was so disappointed. My daughter loves this mix though so it won't go to waste im sure.
0;I have had martinis with fresh bleu cheese stuffed olives in the past and these are tasteless in comparison.  I could not distinguish the taste of bleu cheese.  Take the time and stuff your pitted olives with fresh bleu cheese or find another already prepared brand.
0;I ordered this for my son and his friend as a gag gift for Christmas. I got two of them and one worked and the other was broken. The spring was cracked. Must have been damaged through the mail not sure.. The one gun that did work was ok but lost interest in it after 30 minutes. I also ordered them the Marshmellow shooter and they both worked and LOVED THEM!!

0;"""I don't understand these good reviews. (Its like these reviewers never had real miso soup before.) I had the opposite feeling about this product. I followed the instructions closely and it had all the ingredients of miso soup"
0;"""I was looking for miso soup and just bought  this bowl in supermarket for comparison with instant miso soup in packages.  I don't like the bowl soup at all. I'd say it's not miso soup but plain noodle soup and noodle tastes not very pleasant. There is no miso taste and preparation takes too long. Instant miso in packages tastes great and there is no way I change my preference. BTW the best bet on instant miso packages I found is my local  Trader Joe's Instant Miso Soup. The box contains 4 packets"
0;"""Annie Chun's noodle bowls are downright nasty! The noodles are way too gummy. They should have used dry noodles that soften up when in hot water. The texture would end up much better.<br /><br />I like Miso soup"
0;"""I bought one at Trader Joe's to try out this brand especially the picture on the front label looking so delish and tempting...I get home and try this soup out and thought it just tasted awful! I like miso soup btw but this just didn't cut it. It just tasted so bland"
0;I just finished a can for the first time and it was so bland that I had to write a review somewhere. No taste whatsoever. I would pass if I were you. Chunky has some pretty good soup but this isn't one of them.
0;"""I saw this product on Amazon - saw that it kept getting great reviews and took a chance. I placed an order and now I have 7 boxes still here! I should have listened to the reviews that were less than stellar! For some reason I felt very uncomfortable after eating the 1st box. And I ended up in the bathroom - do not think I need to explain further! The taste was bland but not obnoxious! But I guess it didnt agree with mel And after I have that kind of response to any  new  food it is very hard to bring myself to try it again! So I guess this is another waste of my money - but I will be giving the remaining packages away!"""
0;"""A half-pack of this (if I can stop at a half-pack) usually suffices when a craving for SOMEthing to snack on fights the knowledge of blood sugar readings that are borderline for type 2 diabetes. Other reviewers have described it most adequately"

If you like greasy fatty corn y cheesy cheetos then send yourself into any early grave with these green ones! You will pack on the pounds with this high fat high refined food. If you too are dissappointed with this product you may be looking for roasted green peas. Those are actually whole peas. Or just go to the produce section of your grocer and buy a pack of fresh snap peas!!!

Never again"
0;I received a gift of twenty rolls ofwild cherry lifesavers.  It came in two boxes shrink wrapped together.  the first box was wonderful.  I love wild cherry lifesavers.  The second box so far has been repuslive.  Five out of five rolls that I have tried taste like they have gas or something poured over them.  A very nasty flavour.  This is not Amazons fault of course but the llifesaver company.  I want to write to them and ask if they are now having their products made in China.  There is nothing to say where they were made on the packaging.  So if someone could help me with this I would appreciate it.  Amazon is very good tit is the lifesaver that stink.
0;"""Saw these on Dr. Oz as a great snack.  22 chips per serving...I couldn't eat 3.  They stick to your teeth. I want to trick myself into thinking it taste just like a banana chip...it doesn't.  NO thanks.  Like"
0;"""I must have gotten hold of a bad batch.  The other two reviewers loved it.  How to describe it...kind of think about washing your white load and then drinking the water before the spin/rinse cycle.  There was no garlic"
0;I really like the sugarfree red vines and love the red scotty dogs.  Bought 5# of this and nobody in my family will eat them.  They are chewy but very little flavor.  Thought I could save a few bucks but this one was a mistake...
0;"""The Hot fries that I purchased were of a  second  quality. I had just purchased a case of 12 pack of hot fries about 2 weeks prior. I then ordered the 35 count case from OZBO and I tried them and they were DEFINATELY defective. They were a different look"
0;"""This item is actually  Light Italian  dressing and there is nothing about  Limone  in the name when you get the bottles. The photo is misleading.  Don't order this thinking it is like the Lime Vinaigrete"
0;sorry to say this because I like to support small companies but these are terrible!  They have a greasy coating and very earthy taste.  The sweetness does not even have a good sweet flavor.  I wish I could have tried these first because I would never have bought them!
0;"""I eat cereal every day and always look for different varieties which are low fat and with new flavors so I was excited to get these. First Amazon does not ship dry packaged goods well. This is one of several boxes of food that has arrived at my house either crushed or in crumbs. After getting beyond the look"
0;"""There's nothing good about this cereal.  It's just a bunch of crunchy puffed rice tossed in with some flakes.  It's tasteless.  It's been sitting up in the cubboard waiting for me to throw it away because I won't eat the rest.  Not worth the calories"
0;Bought this brand of coffee wanted to make peppermint mocha at home. And after the holidays this type of coffee was hard to find in store. Took a chance on this brand. No real peppermint flavor. Would not buy again. If looking for a peppermint coffee look else where
0;I ordered Boylan's Birch Beer June 7th sent an email after 2 week to them through Amazon never received a reply. Amazon should auto delete this order because of no action by Boylan's for 30 days.<br />The really sad part of this story is that they make really super great Birch Beer soda.<br />I have since been able to find Boylan's in a local store here in Florida.
0;i was hoping this would taste like a cheap monster but it doesnt it taste like a flat sprite or 7-up  energy wise  ok i  felt a little kick that got me going but i will just stick to the monster energy drink!!!
0;I was fooled by the San Marzano label and bought 2 cans.  Only to later find out San Marzano is a region and the authentic canned San Marzanos say D.O.P. and have the 3 stamps.  The real San Marzano tomatoes do not contain citric acid.
0;"""These are not San Marzano tomatoes at all. Someone was clever enough to name their company San Marzano knowing that naive consumers would be aware of the cache that real DOP San Marzano tomatoes carry and mistakenly think that they were getting a great deal. What they are getting is just a domestic plum tomato. And frankly"
0;"""I bought this brand at a grocery store and by chance am cooking side by side with a can of DOP San Marzano tomatoes from Dani Coop.  Major difference is this San Marzano brand apparently (from what I read on internet) is San Marzano variety of plum tomatoe that they grow in Italy except it is grown in California under different conditions.  The San Marzano brand is much lighter"
0;"""Unfortunately seller did not list ingredients in Product Features or Product Details and I incorrectly assumed it would be like other Furikake Urashima products. When it arrived I read the ingredient label. Ing: Sesame"
0;UGH! I have a Cuisinart that uses k-cups. I've given up trying hot chocolate and am not using good old Swiss Miss (or any brand you prefer) and hot water with my machine. The k-cup hot chocolate is expensive and nasty tasting (all brands except Timothy's white chocolate tried). Waste of money for brown water in a cup.
0;"""This gopher trap is designed poorly.  We have gophers and bought this trap online.  The only problem is that the part that should come down and trap/kill the gopher gets stuck with the dirt when you set the trap up.  I'm not sure if we didn't dig down far enough or what the problem was"
0;the only accurate word from the desription of Arctic Zero is that it is frozen.  I tasted it and had to drink something to get the disgusting taste out of my mouth.  I would not recommend this item to anyone.  The price of Artic Zero is crazy high and the taste is crazy BAD...  I am sure my review won't make it online since I only read good reviews before I bought it....sadly
0;I bought this with high hopes of being able to grow a plant for my younger cousin. I am a gardner myself so I was pretty excited. However the plant NEVER grew no matter what I did. To me it was a waste of money time and resources. DO NOT BUY. Get a plant from a florist or even from Home Depot- it'll be better than this piece of crap.
0;"""This is definitely not the same. I absolutely loved the vanilla as a young person.  I was sooo happy to discover they were making it again. But one bite and I was very disappointed. Not hard at all like it used to be"
0;Six bottles were broken and there was glass everywhere.  The labels were ruined.  I had to wash each bottle to get the glass off.  Enjoyed the product.  But not worth the mess.  Will not purchase again.
0;"""Just a warning....these chips are Not gluten free as they claim to be.  They clearly state on the back of the<br />package that they are manufactured  in a facility with wheat. After I snacked on the Nut chips"

0;19.99 for 12 k-cups is more than double what you will pay even at the most expensive gourmet store.  You can get this very box of coffee at any neighborhood grocery for 8 dollars.<br /><br />The coffee is great... but this item's price is way off base.
0;I purchased these treats from a different store (BJ'S) and they made BOTH my dogs sick! One of them being a 8 week old puppy! DO NOT BUY THESE! DO NOT FEED THEM TO YOUR DOGS! They are dangerous! I will never purchase another Milk Bone product EVER AGAIN!
0;A majority of the PODS are defective. They either don't have enough air pressure in the POD (which results in non-consistent coffee taste) or they are poorly sealed which results in coffee spilling out the side of the POD into your Keurig. Either way I will never order this brand again.
0;I tried this brand after using the Green Mountain brand espresso.  This brand is so NOT extra bold and definitely NOT espresso tasting.<br /><br />If you are looking for a nice cup of coffee on the stronger side this product is passable.  But do not order if you are looking for a Espresso Cup of joe.
0;I purchased a 50 carton of this product and most of the cups I tried will not work in my kerig. The water will not go through the k cup so I end up with about 1/10 of a cup- before it shuts down. What irratates me is I am stuck with them with no refund.My kerig with just water in the machine works fine.
0;These are very frustrating! Bought this huge box for some friends arriving from Mexico who love espresso. The water just can't get through this coffee! SOOOOOOO frustrating and a waste of money. Ground too finely!
0;"""I really like the flavor of these but I am losing money using them.  At first I used to get a few that didn't work very well in each box.  Now 2 out of my last 3 shipments the whole box was defective and won't brew a whole cup.  It messes up the brewer and causes it to flash descale after every cup.  As soon as I use it with another brand or run it with no k cup"
0;The jars were poorly packaged.  Although the 3 jars were packed in bubble wrap there was nothing between each jar.  The jars worked themselves open during shipping and one was even smashed to bits.  One package arrived leaking and with mold inside so it was likely damaged before it was shipped.<br /><br />Amazon remedied the situation to my satisfaction and I love the convenience of ordering products from them.  I just wish the supplier would pack the items better.  This is the only problem I have experienced and I order tons of stuff.
0;I ordered the large box of creamers for the office. It seemed we were always running out. I compared the cost and it would have been much cheaper to continue to buy at the store but I was tired of stopping.<br />The box arrived with 1/8 of the creamers broken open or having the creamer all over it and still not useable.<br />So the overall cost became even more so when you consider the damaged creamers.
0;"""I was so looking forward to these thinking they were going to be like the roll ups I had when I was a kid.  These are terrible.  They taste like flour and pumpkin with gritty bits in it. Does not taste like apricot at all and is a bright orange in color. Nothing at all like a natural fruit roll up.  Don't waste your money on these get the stretch island fruit leather instead.  They taste so much better"
0;I received my oil and did not realize how small the bottles were.  Cannot be returned so I will savor them when I use them.  I know truffle oil is very expensive but this is a joke.  I will not buy these again.
0;After trying some of the bumblebee flavored tunas and a few of the starkist ones I really hoped that this would be as good. I was wrong. To start out with the tuna in the can is not even close to the others quality. The other brands are more of a fillet stamped out and canned. This is tiny chuncks crammed into a can with a sickly sweey sauce. I would guess it is about 60% tuna 40% sauce. I like sweet chili sauce.... I like tuna.... I dont like this though.<br /><br />UPDATE: --- I thought I had come up with a good way to get rid of this tuna. I would feed it to my dog. My dog (which loves tuna) just refused to eat this. I guess she would rather eat dogfood than this product!
0;"""I had this granola for the first time about a week ago on a trip - bought a bag at the airport and it was very good. When I got home I ordered a lot of 12 bags from amazon and it arrived yesterday. The individual bags of granola were very compressed and so the granola was broken into tiny bits - you're supposed to be able to eat this with your fingers. I opened one bag for a taste and it was completely"
0;These were terrible and horrible --- I ended up giving them to a vegan friend of mine who is a health nut and she liked them.  If you are used to eating food others would consider inedible then these are for you --- if taste is important DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT.
0;"""I order dozens of products from Amazon every month and this is the first time I truly am compelled to review a product I had purchased.<br /><br />Wow. How difficult is it really to mess up a chewing gum? Well"
0;These are really gross. They taste like 20 calories worth of chocolate and peanut butter covered cardboard. I would not recommend this large of a box unless you've tried a smaller box or sample and liked it first.
0;"""I bought these without trying first because the price was at a 50% discount and I didn't want to miss the low price.<br />After trying one I really wish I would have waited and tried to find a single to taste first"
0;We gave our dog 2 of these treats and they made him ill all night...I will spare you the details but it was not pretty. The treats are greasy and must be very rich. Not worth the risk unless you want a sick puppy.
0;I had high hopes for this jerky based on the other review I read.  However I think they need to rename this product. It is described as Cajun and hot.  It was sweet like candy and had absolutely no heat to it.  I would say more like sweet Teriyaki.<br />I think this recipe needs a redo.  Jerky should not be this sweet.  The bag of jerky I bought was passed around to 5 other people who all said it was too sweet.  I spent 8 dollars on a bag and threw it in the trash.  Very disappointed.  If I could give you zero stars I certainly would.<br />I cannot recommend this to anyone and will not buy any of your products.
0;"""I received these as a Xmas gift. I was so anticipating these pistachios since I had tried  Wonderful  before and they were delicious.<br />The bag that I received appeared to be over-roasted and the nuts did not taste good at all. I notified the company but as of this date I have received no response.<br />These were a waste of money."""
0;"""I don't like to return the items in general.  because I usually spend some time researching and reading to make sure the product that I order is up to my expectation. This light coffee didn't make coffee at all. I used the pod in my commercial Cuisinart one cup coffee maker and it gives me too light cup of coffee"
0;"""I also received the wrong tree the first time.  The first tree came quickly but was also the Gardenia tree.  After contacting Amazon they reshipped the correct tree.  It came quickly and was packed properly.  Upon arrival the tree looked good"
0;Came covered in black mold. The plant never recovered even though it was treated right. Waste time and money. Should have known better than to purchase plants of the internet. (was also purchased for mothers day)
0;"""Save your money or spend a few dollars more & visit a local nursery or at least shop around more & read customer reviews. I bought this as a gift for Mother's Day. It arrived in a timely manner & in good condition or what appeared to be healthy to a layman. She followed guidelines for watering"
0;"""These almonds arrived in a clear plastic bag closed with a plastic tie.  There is no original packaging or brand name on them.  It is as if some person took a container of chocolate covered almonds out of their cabinet"
0;"""My husband and I both had the same reaction to the apples - WE SPIT THEM OUT. I had to check the packaging to see if there was some bizarre chemical they used to process it as the nasty chemical taste overwhelmed everything - and lingered in my mouth long after I spit out the apple. I wish I could return these because they'd go back in a heartbeat. I've been too reluctant to try the peach or cherry yet. I hate to throw out food"
0;"""I made the popcorn with the butter and the mix. I avoid using butter on all foods for the pure fat content. I thought the butter packet was actually some type of caramel or sweet flavoring - but it was just butter. I used less than 1/2 of the butter packet after realizing it was not a flavoring and chucked the rest int he trash. The other packet tasted like seaweed and rice snacks. I tried it"
0;I have enjoyed Slim-Jims for many years and was looking forward to having a case of them shipped to me.  I recieved them yesterday and tore into one only to find a whole box of old spoiled ones that our dog wouldn't even eat.  Please take this as a warning if you are about to order this product.  I came on line to find out how to return this product and it tells me that it is non-returnable.  I guess I am out $14.00 for this product.  Can anyone tell me short of contacting the Slimjim co.  if there is a way to get a refund.  This was my first and last time ordering food from Amazon.  I am glad I didn't order more.
0;"""This coffee smells great but it is like drinking flavored water.  Very little flavor at all.  For the price you can purchase a better flavored coffee.  I need my coffee to actually possess the flavor of coffee"
0;I ordered this Tea twice and they kept sending Twinnings Breakfast Tea....So thats why I rated it zero...I would like to try it But I am through trying to order it because they cant seem to correct the Problem...
0;"""The only thing that impressed me was the speed to prepare---the so-called brownie was like a piece of kids chocolate cake with the choco syrup--you can do better at the Little Debbie shelf at the local supermaket.  The price was absurd if it was on a half price discount and then I would be looking for an ice cream coupon.  Sorry folks"
0;This Lady brand duck sauce is the same you get in some Chinese resaurants but to me it's NOT sweet or flavorful at all.  I don't recommend this product especially for the high cost of shipping on something you cannot return.  I thought this would be something to compliment the excellent tasting hot mustard packets by Lady brand but this duck sauce is just liquid goo/cornstarch with no flavor.  2 thumbs down as I think I can find another brand somewhere.
0;"""I typed  Kosher gelatin  in the search field on Amazon and this is what came up. After I ordered this and recieved it I noticed that it is made from swine (luckily before I ate any). Amazon won't allow me to return this because it's a gracery item"
0;"""Not worth the money spent for one spice packet for one dinner!  Way to expensive.  Could have gone out and been served for the price I paid for one spice packet for one meal.  Crazy!  Thought it was for 12 - nope what it really means is 12 scewers"
0;I have ordered more than 12 cases of Murrays cookies in the past.  This shipment of cookies more than half of the cookies in the sack were broken.  This is either a manufacturing problem or a shipment problem with this order.
0;"""Somebody at Eden needs to package these differently...I opened up my shipment today and there was a big sticky purple puddle in the box.  I love this company and buy loads of their products but this particular product was a disappointment.  And to those people who say  Dont review the shipping"
0;"""I bought this tea b/c I assumed is was similar to the organic 40 count box that I buy in the super market. Well these tea bags contain half the tea. The quality of tea is not even the same b/c I used 2 bags inside of the usual 1. The instruction say to put the bag in a tea cup"
0;"""Wish I had looked at the box more carefully before buying this tea.  While taking a bag out of the box I noticed it states on the back of the box  Product of China .  With all the articles on the news lately about unsafe"
0;"""These capsules direct from Nespresso are between $0.50 and $0.65 per capsule. This listing is for ten capsules. Do the math! It is false to indicate the regular price is four times higher than it actually is. Amazon"
0;We ordered Wolfgang Puck Sumatra blend and Columbia Blend after discovering that Senseo brand apparently  is no longer available anywhere.  These two blends were very disappointing.  Neither blend had hardly any taste!  We tried doubling up by using two pods to no avail.  Don't buy this coffee brand....we are now stuck with a 5 boxes of coffee we can't drink!  What a disappointment.
0;"""I've bought other flavors (cinnamon raisin and cinnamon) of Jacobsen's snack toast in the past (from a grocery store) and loved them.  I have year old twins and I give them the snack toast to help with teething and as a treat.  The cinnamon and cinnamon raisin flavors are all natural and taste great.  This blueberry flavor is NOT all natural.  The blueberry flavored bits are made up of: sugar"
0;"""I bought these expecting to fall in love with them because I love malt vinegar and potato chips.  On the outside of the original box packaging there was grease all over the place and when I opened up a bag to try them"
0;I was happy to find the Pepperidge Farm Stuffing. The shipping was fast. When I opened the box I discovered that all packages were STALE DATED. Expired 12 months ago. Yes I double checked the date. I threw them in the trash.
0;Sadly these arrived melted beyond recognition. I will NOT purchase again from this vendor. Either they are stored improperly or shipped improperly.<br /><br />i have now discarded ALL 6 of these boxes AND discovered that I can buy properly stored and shipped Milk Duds at a lower price.

0;I have tried several raw cacao powders from different companies and this one was the worst. When mixed with moisture it becomes like mud. It was impossible to get a smooth dessert or cream using this powder and the flavor seems muted as though the intense chocolate flavor is missing. It was also more expensive than the other brands I tried. I won't order this product again. Very disappointed.
0;"""It's grainy and lacking in real cacao taste - instead it has some nasty after-taste that's really intolerable.  I usually buy raw cacao powder from Longevity Warehouse and it's a transcendent experience.  This stuff is a waste of money and my time.  I'll try to return it. <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168GTX2 >Ecuadorian Truly Raw Cacao Butter"
0;I am Franco-American and I was missing my green lentils du Puy.  They have a distinctive appearance and after having cooked them they are scrumptious.  The lentils I received were ordinary lentils and thus inauthentic.  I was so disappointed!
0;"""I was extremely dismayed when I received the product only to read on the label that it contains WHEAT starch as well as honey. I was looking forward to using the powered form for baking and being allergic to wheat and other gluten products I can't use this. Also it cannot be returned due to some kind of laws about food products. PLEASE"
0;"""I remain unimpressed and still waiting for the product to be delivered as a Christmas gift to my elderly parents.  While I paid for an expedited delivery date ($22.00)  the product remains stagnated in Maumee"
0;I placed an order with you on 4-11-05.  that was 11 days ago. Tracking only showed it traveling around the United States but not to my state.  Now Amazon says there was no order.  You have my money debited from my checking account. I plan to repeat negative reviews as long as it takes.

0;"""I tried both the  Health  and the  Mana . Both were awful in taste and neither had any discernable effect on my energy levels. I bought them for their appearance as a fun gift for my LAN group. One of the bottles had leaked in the box and the smell alone should have warned me to not drink it. But live and learn. The one benefit I got out of the purchase was that the bottles can be filled with water and food coloring to use as game props or displays. They are aesthetically pleasing to the eye when you hang them in a window with the different colors catching the daylight."""
0;"""Well to start I don't know why this is under toys when it's a drink.  The bottle is pretty and coll looking but the smell and taste is terrible. Also the horrible taste will stay in your mouth for quite a while. I don't recommend this is you intend to drink it. But I resealed mine and put in on a shelf with the rest of my collectors stuff. Same thing goes for the mana drink"
0;"""The picture makes it look like they will be little portion cups of jelly.  They aren't.  They are packets of jelly (like little ketchup bags) in foil.  They aren't very attractive and I don't want to serve them to my guests.  Perhaps they would be okay for a camping trip.  I called to complain and Amazon sent me another box of the same thing.  They don't accept returns on food"
0;"""Ordered the Honey Roasted Cashews & Macadamias since I can no longer find them in stores and I went on auto ship.  When my first shipment arrived there were supposed to be 6 containers in the package and there were only 5.  I love it"
0;"""The product labeling in my mind is a little deceptive considering these crackers contain a forum of MSG. MSG's most active ingredient is free glutamate. Free glutamate is the active ingredient of mono-sodium glutamate"
0;If not these organic crackers are not for you. These taste so great in part because they contain yeast extract which acts a lot like MSG in the body. Please research yeast extract before feeding these to children and if you choose to use this product watch for behavior changes. We learned very painfully just how harmful this ingredient can be for some kids.
0;I am very disappointed in what I received today... I expected a larger bag and these bones are nothing for a chocolate lab.  very disappointed that Old Mother Hubbard does not have large wheat free biscuits for big dogs.... End of story!
0;"""How can something that looks this delicious fail to have any taste? There's dark chocolate but almost no discernible sweetness! SO disappointed. For the 190 calories and plenty of protein AND great taste"
0;Just bought this product for the first time and I would not buy or recommend it to anyone.  It taste is very bland with an after taste that is not complementary. The chocolate taste like no flavor wax while the peanuts or whatever nuts they are putting into it is stale.<br /><br />Hope this helps you to not buy this product.
0;All of the spices that I purchased from this company were stale and old. Some of them even had bugs in them.  Star Anise is supposed to have a wonderful licorice like flavor.  This had no smell and tasted like old cardboard.
0;This was very dissapointing especially after reading all the other great reviews. The problem with most nut milk bags is the material and seams are too weak to handle the wringing of the slurry. I gave it the tug test before I tried to use it and it was literally coming apart. So I returned it right back the next day to Amazon for a refund.
0;"""I have been on the HCG Diet and was looking for a way to make the 2 liters of water that I have to drink everyday better tasting. I've had this product along with the strawberry and orange flavor for 2 weeks now. I must say that the flavors are great tasting but the side effects of gas"
0;"""I bought the new container of French's French Fried Onion Rings and they were STALE from the moment I opened them.  NEVER had a problem with the old container.  This new container even says  stay fresh can .  Please go back to the old can!"""
0;This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review of anything online.  I'll submit the same to French's as well.  It is disappointing that they have ruined a Holiday staple for the sake of saving money.  I hope their sales declines and forces the return of the original packaging.  The new plastic containers add a strong chemical or plastic taste.  It seems to burn off during cooking but those of us that love to eat straight from the container are left with a horrible after taste.  I also can't help but to feel like the product is poisoning us some how...if I can taste the chemical then it surely is going into my body.  I just hope it's not being absorbed.  Please bring back the original container.
0;There is nothing fluffy about this product but the box appears to have a picture on the top that seems to advertise that way.  These are hard candy lollipops!  I had wanted cotton candy fluffy lollipops.  They also arrived with about 12 broken or cracked of the 48 in the box and likely came that way from the manufacturer.  Fortunately I only needed 33 for a classroom .. but I would never order these again.
0;"""Why bother creating an alternative grain (that's naturally gluten-free) cereal that's NOT gluten free?!?!?  I bought this knowing millet is generally gluten-free... glad I did more research before I ate it!  Arrowhead Mills has other gluten-free products...  Why not this?  On the packaging"
0;"""I recently bought a bag of california natural healthbars lamb and rice for my dog and was DISCUSTED when I snapped one in half and found it was FULL of hair. I kept taking more and more out of the bag and snapping them in half and they were all full if hair. Thick black whisker like hair"
0;So I am so not happy with what I received. The picture is very misleading and so is what is underneath. It shows friskies signature blend and says it underneath which I know they haven't made in a while and I was hoping someone had some extra stock. So when I bought it for $19.31 I was very upset that I got a 6.3lb bag of grillers blend. So this product information is false advertising and needs to update what they would actually mail to the consumer. I could of bought two 15lb of cat food for that price I just was willing to spend the extra because I hoped it was extra stock. Never agaom
0;At least it was chicken stuffing flavored. I expected chicken stuffing mix a whole 48 ounce container. What arrived was nasty tasting Hormel chicken n stuffing prepared microwave meals. 6 of them in case box at 10 ounces each. I have to say there was a large chunk of all white meat chicken in the middle of the disgusting mess though.
0;"""I only bought this trap after i could no longer find the  Black Hole  (which worked every time). I must have set this trap at least 30 times and never once caught anything. Finally found the  Black Hole  gopher trap again"

0;"""This product fell apart into little pieces about 2 minutes after I put it into boiling water.  The flavor was OK (bland) but the texture was disgusting.  The end result looked like Chef Boyardee spaghetti and tasted worse.  Because the spaghetti contained quinoa"
0;I never write reviews but in this case I had to make an exception.  To put it simply this stuff was HORRIBLE.  It was like drinking pink paint but not as good. After 1 cup I lined my garbage barrel with the rest.  If my barrel had taste buds it would have puked it back on me.  Stay away!
0;Ok...I can get a can of this from the grocery store for 1.39...no tax...And you are selling it for 2.00 plus 9.00 shipping?...Either I want what you're smoking or get into business with you...Just go away...
0;They listed this product as Small Bite Size.  There is nothing bite size about them.  They are slivers and crumbs.  I gave it a 1 because of the ingredients.  If your looking to sprinkle this over your existing dog food then buy it.  If your looking to use as training treats then don't bother.  I'm going to order the normal size.
0;When this arrived there were no whole dog treats in the bag.<br />The bag was filled with what looked like coffee grounds except it was moving<br />-with dozens of live maggots! This was the worst Amazon purchase ever. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
0;"""We decided to try this dogfood because it was a few dollars cheaper than the Iams weight control that we normally buy.  We have spent FAR more than those few dollars in paper towels and cleaning supplies.  I guess because of the name"
0;Hoping we just got a REALLY bad batch because every one of these we've tried is bitter and plain gross.  I would NEVER buy this again!  Gonna contact the company and see if they will replace them (in hopes this is a bad batch).  If they won't replace them I refuse to subject myself to these ever again!!!  IF they do replace them I will post a follow up.

Only slows down absorption for an hour or two for me. Caution if eating left overs the rise is quicker. If you eat this with tomato sauce realize all tomato sauce has carbs you need to take this into account. People have said it is the acid in the tomato sauce that causes the rise"
0;"""please do not take this note as an attack on your product. It is just that my Snoodle hates the taste. She will only eat it if she is starving and the fact that she just turned one year old bothers me that she is not getting good nutrition consistantly. Do you have a different flavor that I can try? Please help"
0;I can eat just about anything but these noodles smelled like fish as soon as I opened the package. I tasted absolutely no garlic or herb...didn't even smell it! The texture was unbearable and they made me nauseated all afternoon. I have some of the plain angel hair pasta so I'm going to try those but I'm probably giving them to my brother who said he will at least try them.
0;I ate the noodles for dinner with spaghetti sauce at 7pm. I started feeling nauseous a few hours later which continued through the night. At @7am the next morning I vomited up the undigested noodles. Won't be eating those again.
0;"""I don't understand how anybody could think that these are too sweet or too spicy. There is absolutely no sweet or spicy taste.<br /><br />I bought them in hopes I could make a quick side dish that resembled sweet potato casserole. Prepared exactly per directions. They were bland"
0;"""I got sold on the product when I read the review and hope the only reason for the review was that people all over the world have different taste.<br /><br />The tea arrived in a package which does not match the picture...that's not a good start.<br /><br />The side of the package was not sealed and thus I believe the aroma compromised. I wish I had not purchased the tea from China Mist<br /><br />I actually tried another tea store in NY"

0;I have a three year old lasspoo I have given him sweet potato treats before and he loved them. I have heard and read so many great things about sams yams that when I saw them on amazon I got 4 bags super excited. When I got them I opened them up and gave one to my very excited dog he loved it. But as my doggie is small only 18 lbs I decided to cut them in half so I emptied the treats on my kitchen table to find TWO LIVE MAGGOTS! I was so grossed out I quickly took the treat away from my doggie and opened another bag and the same thing MORE MAGGOTS!  I'm so disappointed please do not buy this product! I have pictures !<br /><br />I called the company and left a message since it was after hours I never heard back. Needless to say I returned them to amazon. I wish I could leave a picture on this review to show u all!

0;Just poured all 24 cans down the sink--didn't want to risk anyone else getting sick. Sampled two chilled cans. Both contained vinegar-flavored sparkling water.  Couldn't detect any blueberry. Had a stomach ache for hours afterwards.  This was a waste of $18.00.
0;I have had peppers grow just fine in the past. I thought this product looked neat so I got it on Amazon. The pepper sprouted and grew OK. Once big enough I re potted them in great soil with enough water and heat. The three sprouts wilted and died in about a week. :(
0;I bought two of these from local stores and had to germinate the seeds in a different container after picking them out of this one. One started to germinate so i put it back in this container. I overwatered it and lost it. The second can didn't work as per the instructions either. I got four to germinate and planted the four. The died as soon as I transfered them.
0;I bought this novelty plant about 2 months ago and I've got to say it sucks. Don't waste your money. I've read a lot about growing these chilis and I am doing everything perfectly including keeping the seeds/soil warm. I live in Arizona so warm temperatures aren't a problem. After a month of trying to grow the plant I contacted the magic plant company. They sent me more seeds which looked like the flakes you put on pizza minus the seeds. I planted them anyway. Another month later...and still nothing. I wouldn't waste my time with this. Go on eBay and buy the whole live plant if you want to have a ghost chili plant.
0;"""I understand that these items are fragile but my experience was horrible. The box was surrounded on only one side with bubble protection. 70 out of 80 sticks were broken. I got these instead of the better-tasting Bob's Original Candy Canes based on the reviews of mostly-successful"

0;"""I thought it would taste good considering the price and fancy box. I also figured it'd save me time and money on meals for work...WRONG! This is the worst! I don't think I've ever tasted anything this awful in my life. The noodles were difficult to even separate with a fork according to the instructions. Once that was finally done and I poured the dark brown goop  sauce  into the box and heated it up"
0;One of the listed ingredients is listed as evaporated cane juice. Sure sounds like sugar to me.<br />Another listed ingredient is Carrageenan which is a known carcinogen. Sorry folks I'm sure it probably tastes great but throwing in a buch of terms like natural and organic does not make it healthy.

0;The color is that perfect oblong gold - yes should be. But I both the same tea and color is almost black and tea is dry. Not fresh.<br />Before both from Adagio.com - always was perfect. It is better to pay $4-$5 more and get a good stuff.
0;"""The Amazon.com page for this items states  Item count says 100 and a shipping weight says 6 pounds .  The picture shows a box of pig ears. I ordered and recieved  1  pig ear with shipping cost almost $7.00.  Complete rip off!  This is false advertising at its worse and now they want to charge me shipping to return my $7.00 pig ear.  I will be filing a complaint with BBB to protect others on Amazon.com from being ripped off like this."""
0;"""This product is a shoddy replacement for their European Dutch-Processed cocoa (in the silver container) which I used exclusively with fantastic results.  I was mortified when they discontinued it.  At first I was glad to see they put out another Dutch-processed cocoa. What a letdown.  This product is over-processed (they used too much alkali)"
0;"""I've used the silver can dutch cocoa for years and have always loved it. This Special Dark version is darker and does not taste nearly as good as the silver can variety. I had to make two batches of chocolate icing"
0;I have even written to Hershey's to ask what happen to the Dutch Processed Cocoa (silver can) and they tried to tell me that the new can was the same thing.  Do they think we are stupid?  The cocoas DO NOT even look or taste the same!!!  What's up with Hershey's? Does it have anything to do with their move to Mexico??  I just don't get it.  Why would a product that so many people LOVE be taken off the shelf??  Something just doesn't add up here.  I've given up on the Hershey's cocoa that my mother used to make her famous fudge for years.  Really hated to see this one go.
0;"""We just bought (from Amazon.com) a soft ice cream maker and while we love the maker we aren't thrilled with the fact that getting Dutch processed cocoa (the only kind recommended for use in ice cream) is very difficult.<br /><br />One thing for sure -- this ain't it.  It's only average in flavor"
0;"""I use this and actually do like it. I buy some things<br />in bulk from Amazon because I can get a price that is<br />less than I can buy it at the store.  My Publix always<br />carries this for 3.49/per. This price is almost 4.00/per.<br /><br />Maybe you could check with another supplier"
0;"""Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb Milk Chocolates Assortment<br /><br />Well...they sounded great to me! The reviews were great too! Off they went for Mothers' Day (shame on me). The  giftee  said they were   the most ***awful chocolates I've ever had! I tried several...no carmels"
0;I love Panda regular black licorice but grabbed this one by mistake at the grocery store. Blek...I had to throw the box away after managing to eat half. Licorice has a strong flavor but the herbs in this formula make you forget there's any licorice in it.

GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide and is one of the ingredients in this product. They are also made to be resistant to high levels of a chemical called glyphosate"
0;"""This coffee bean doesn't taste anything like the one i've tried in starbuck and at some oher candy store. It has a somewhat rusty or metallic taste that i can't figure out. Also the product arrived partially damaged i guess from the extreme heat"
0;Got this as a gift. It came late. The ice pack it shipped with was completely warm when it arrived days late. Some of the candy was expired- Cherrymash expired about a week ago. 2 candies listed were not included- zagnut bar and moon pie. Most of the box is either gum or hard candy/taffy. I would not spend the money myself and I feel bad that my friend did!
0;I've recently purchased other nuts from this brand (walnuts) and they were delicious. These almonds are hard as rocks! I don't know if they are stale or what is wrong with them but they can barely be chewed without causing harm to the teeth. I will not purchase again.
0;I have ordered this product twice now and both times it has had the same problem. Whenyou run the coffee all the grounds come out into your coffee mug. I thought it was just a bad batch but it is just the product I think.
0;In my opinion I totally wasted my good money on a inferior and unsatisfactory product.  I find the fact that they call their watered down Chai a concentrate is a joke.  If your planning on buying this product I would seriously urge you to reconsider.
0;One of the bins arrived broken and the brine had leaked all over everything else in the box.  The olives are mushy and way too salty!!! I highly recommend going with the Roland Cracked Green Olives from Greece product available via Amazon too.  Don't waste your money on the Peloponnese Cracked Green Olives!!!
0;"""This chew in the  wolf-size  lasted my 22lb dog about a minute. He easily broke the bone into large chunks and swallowed them. I would not recommend these as a long lasting treat though they are apparently tasty. Bully sticks last much longer for him and might be a good alternative to these because they are also easier to digest than rawhide treats."""
0;"""Have been buying this flavored coffee for many years and the past two years ordering from Amazon because we can't find it locally in Western New York.  The last two shipments tasted awful and we wonder just what Smuckers has done to this once great flavored coffee.  The last pot tasted like motor oil and gave us an upset stomach.  Sorry"
0;Tastes like watered down cheap hot choclate with instant coffee thrown in.  Tossed it down the sink.  Now I have 5 unopened tubs and 1 with one pot made out of it.  Very dissapointed I really like the french vanilla.  This is very sub-par.  Wish we could return grocery items.
0;"""The seaweed is excellent quality however you only get to make one piece at a time because the Nori is very small. It's awful if you're making a lot of sushi at once. I prefer larger sheets so I can roll and cut many pieces of sushi. I will not be buying this product again because of this. It was however delicious Nori and good quality rice and very quick to do. It's just no good if you're looking to make more then 10 pieces"

I won't say it's delicious but the flavor is obviously high quality.<br /><br />This cheaper 2.8 oz DoMatcha is acrid and astringent.

0;Ordered 10/4/2011 Received 10/11/2011 Shipped from PA to NV Arrived 6 Days before estimate. WoW is all I can say about shipping!!!<br /><br />Then I brewed two pots and each was a disappointment.. a conservative guess would be 60% stem 40% leaf by weight.  It is very hard to tell until tea has been brewed and the leafs open.  Quite disappointed as I consume 2 to 3 quarts of brewed tea a day.  I will never purchase English Tea Store brand again..
0;"""I tried to order the listed item  honey roasted peanuts  two times for my trip away from my peanut allergy son. This is the one time a year I can eat peanuts and not worry about contamination. Both times I received  honey mustard peanuts  and unfortunately I did not get my gourmet peanuts for my trip."""
0;"""I purchased this honey believing the the Bio-Active 20+ rating was equal to a UMF registered rating.  After further research I realized I did not get what I thought I was ordering.  Guess that was my fault by not researching more than I did before ordering.  The taste is good and I will use it for other than medicinal purposes - but feel I paid way too much for what I received.  For those who don't know"
0;Surprised with this one as the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf rules Cali and serves up the best Coffee and Teas. I tried many cups and am can say this Chai is my least favorite Chai ever. The tea is like warm water and very weak. I would not suggest this to anyone that enjoys a good tea.
0;I just bought this at the store trying to get my cheesy snack and both my wife and I thought it had a taste of a greasy strawberry with a hint of butter.  HORRIBLE.  I cannot believe this product is even sold???  Who in their right mind thinks this even tastes anything like cheddar?
0;ConAgra has made a hugh mistake by discontinuing the Pour Over Cheddar.  This new O.R. cheddar cheese popcorn is like eating those peanuts used for shipping fragile items.  Don't waste your money on this orange yuk.  I wanted to give it zero stars!
0;"""Just popped a bag of this popcorn. I was excited because i love cheddar popcorn. I opened the popped bag and dug in. Only to find that the popcorn didn't taste anything like cheddar. I can't even describe what it tasted like. Kinda antiseptic..ewww"

WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  It doesn't can't hold a candle to the original pour over!<br /><br />We need to start a campaign to bring back THE BEST popcorn that was ever produced...Orville Redenbacher's  Pour Over  Cheddar Popcorn!!"""
0;"""I thought the other reviewers may have been jaded and it can't be that bad. I mean I loved Orville Redenbacher's pour over cheddar popcorn. Well I can't believe they call this cheddar cheese popcorn. By far this is the worst cheese popcorn I have ever tasted. There is no cheese flavor"
0;"""Candy Express sent me cheap no-name knock-offs of the actual Joyva brand which is the brand I wanted. This no-name (no logo on package) stuff they sent doesn't taste as good either. I'm VERY disappointed"
0;I wouldn't purchase this product again. The order I received was manufactured in 2004 and 2006! I'm sure this affects the potency. I get no energy boost at all. Too bad I bought 24 pack because I thought it was a great deal:(
0;"""While I can't truly speak regarding the taste as I wasn't even able to try the product. I have an allergy to Carageenan (Seaweed) and even though I took special care to determine the ingredient wasn't in there (even checked outside of Amazon)... it is unfortunately in there. So"
0;YUCK!!  YUCK!!! YUCK!!!  Who would think that anything cinnamon could be so unappealing and downright gross tasting?  The Smoky Chili & Lime is no better.  Huge waste of money and I will definitely not order again!
0;I have 3 cats and they are little piggies and none of them would touch these...wouldn't even TRY them. One of my cats will eat just about anything you offer him and he wouldn't even try them. They gobble up the Liv-a-littles dehydrated chicken so I thought I'd try these.  Looks like raccoons are getting these! I do not recommend!!
0;My reclaimed feral cats normally mob me for treats.  These are very hard and must not have a good taste.  I was really disappointed that Halo would produce something this bad and that Amazon would sell it.
0;"""I don't know how this company dares to label this as  Chocolate Fudge Brownie  as it tastes absolutely nothing like that. A lot of so called flavored coffees have disappointingly little of the flavor they have supposedly added to the coffee"
0;Never even heard of 'Tassimo Professional (Foodservice) Coffeemakers'. so was innocent mistake to buy for my home machine. discs do not work at all. like barcode-reader hasn't a clue. Return policy sucks. One more example of price too good to be true.
0;I recently purchased this after using Lavazza for years.  Wanted to get an organic bean.  If you like strong espresso this bean is not for you.  It is maybe the strength of a french roast but not an espresso roast. I am returning to Lavazza until further notice! Buyer beware!

0;These are not particularly sour and the texture on your tongue is like chalk. There isn't any nutritional information for calorie and sugar content. So bad that I won't even try to give them away. I wouldn't want to ruin a child's Halloween!

0;I was looking forward to getting these berries for the health benefits but was so disapointed when I opened the bag and discovered a lot of the berries were moldy.  I thought I could pick through but the moldy ones out numbered the good ones and was unable to return.
0;This product is advertised as Himalayan Goji berries. I understand that the Himalayas border on China. These berries are a product of CHINA. In view of the numerous food safety concerns around food production in China I would never had purchased this product had I known its origin. The product itself I had no problems with. Product of China should be in the description of these berries.
0;"""Unfortunately I did not read all the 1-star ratings on this product prior to purchasing.  I had similar experiences with this Navitas product having black spots and mold.  Some of the berries were extremely dried out but nothing to be concerned about because it is dried fruit.  I have read articles stating that eating too much of this at one time can cause gastrointestinal issues.  Yes"
0;"""Confirmed Goji Berry causing severe nausia cramping and intestinal pain.<br /><br />I was introduced to goji berries during the summer as a friend I met had just opened a raw food cafe. His food NEVER (I mean never) gave me any problems it was all delicious and much of it was cacao and goji berries. He has very selective about his sources and does not trust many companies out there.(His Goji comes from Sunfood)<br /><br />When I returned home from Alaska I decided to try more superfoods and bought a trail mix by Navitas that was Goji"
0;"""I believe this is my first review. I am slightly addicted to Goji berries. I snack on them at work and re-hydrate them in tea before adding the mix to a tall bottle of ice and fresh lemon juice. I have a subscription to Navitas on Amazon. I got my first bag. I found the fruit very hard and dry but decent in size and still a great snack until I kept having to spit out mouthfuls due to the distinct nasty taste of mold. I thought I just got a bad bag but when my second order arrived.....same thing. You could see the black spots of mold on the berries. Most Goji's coming from China are dried til they are hard as pebbles b/c of the long month long journey (or more) to get here. They are still prone to pathogens and mold. I ordered Dragon Herbs Heaven Mountain Goji's and will follow up on how they are. Dragon herbs is a reputable company that has a process for dealing with the issues facing Goji's travel from China. If anyone knows a locally grown organic source of Goji's that is reasonably priced"
0;"""The Goji is no doubt a 'superfood' and I've been having them for a long time and so may have become a goji connoisseur. The last time i bought these from Navitas and they just weren't good. They didn't taste good"
0;"""This was my first experience with goji berries so I was excited to try them.  I actually spit them out they were so bad.  Tasteless except for a moldy/salty taste!  Thinking that maybe this is how they are supposed to taste"
0;I was not aware of country of origin when I ordered this.  I avoid all China goods due to their use of dangerous poisons in many products.  Amazon does not allow returns of groceries or I would sendt it back.  Claims to meet USDA guidelines for organic foods but how can that be believed with China's recent history of poisonous products.
0;"""Received these figs from Amazon and was horribly disappointed.  They are almost inedible.  They are extremely tough and as dry as shoe leather.  There is very little fig  meat  inside the leathery skin.<br /><br />I will look elsewhere from now on.  I have had Calimyrna figs before and know what to expect.  These  figs  from Sun-Maid are only fit as a food source for starving cattle!  Where is the quality control at Sun-Maid?"""
0;Give me a reason to buy from you? Nespresso website is half the price. 0.57/caps and 6.95 for shipping.<br />Total is .70 per caps shipping included and yours is 1.22 per caps for the same quantity!<br />I usually buys on amazon because I find good deals.<br />You should revise your pricing or change business.<br />I'll update my review if you change your prices to be at least cheaper that Nespresso themselves.
0;"""Buy a hersey bar... it's not any worse than this stuff.<br />Any dark chocolate bar that refuses to display the cocoa content on the front of the package is doing so for a reason. They are hiding the low content from you.<br /><br />If you wish to experience real chocolate"
0;Why oh why did Campbell's ever change this recipe?? The new recipe is NOTHING like the new one. The carrots & extra cheesy flavor makes this new recipe way too sweet rather then mild and salty like the old recipe.
0;"""I needed a very good product for my dogs in the Vetri-Science Glyco-Flex Stage II joint support.  This product came highly recommended from my Vet.  I reviewed the Amazon site for what I thought was a good price when the Ad showed 2 bottles of the product.  I thought I was getting two bottles for the price.  I only received One bottle.  I wrote the company customer Services who agreed that the two bottles was misleading and they would get back to me the next day after she talked to her supervisor.  That was on December 13 and today is December 23 and still no response"
0;I used to buy these from Amazon at least 2-3 times a month.  The last 2 shipments were hard as a rock and the potatoes looked like plastic.  I definitely did not give these to my shih tzu. The treats used to be softer and you could tear them into smaller pieces.  The last ones I received I couldn't even cut with a knife.  I won't be buying these any more until I start seeing some positive reveiws.
0;"""My dogs LOVED the former sliced and dehydrated type.<br />The  new  ones are so processed and formed they drop immediately and leave them lay.<br />By the time I opened this container the return time had expired.  DO NOT BUY!<br />The good reviews are for the former type which WERE great treats."""
0;I really thought that I could make a sugar-free chocolate milk or have something to have in my cocoa since I'm trying to reduce my sugar intake. This product is horrible. It doesn't dissolve into solution (hot or cold) and tastes chalky and not at all sweet. Just breakdown and use the extra calories with the agave nectar. It has calories but is much better than wasting your money on this low-cal alternative.
0;This is terrible and does not meet the expectations.  I thought that I could add to water and it would give it a good taste but it was terrible.  Maybe it would be better with milk but I do not drink milk.
0;I came to amazon looking for info on whether this product was true vanilla because I put 1/2 teaspoon in 1 cup of coffee and could not taste it at all. I wanted to see if I had a counterfeit product. Closer inspection shows that it is clearly listed as being a blend when you read the ingredients. The flavor is weak and flat. I strongly recommend trying real vanilla extract. Kirkland has a great product.
0;in the add for lipton decaf tea bags 48pk the customer is led to believe that they are buying 48 boxes of tea instead when we received the order there were only twelve boxes of 48.  We will not be buying another product from this company again.  We can buy the same thing from the grocery store for half of what we paid buying it online.
0;I was curiose to see how much it was actualy be to buy from amazon v. the local grocery retailor.. I cannot see how they would ever think of starting this branch of service. Only an idiot would buy such a widely available product for such a massive markup.
0;"""I purchased a box of these from my local grocery store for about $4.50 ... which I thought was a bit pricy so I came home and looked on Amazon to see if anyone was selling them cheaper.  Imagine my glee when I saw this price ...<br />24 for $49.99.  24 boxes for $49.99 comes to about $2.08 each .... except there was a problem.  I didn't get 24 boxes.  I got 4 boxes w/ 6 cookie bars which equals 24.  If you do the math"
0;Excessive kernals in bag after popping. Only pops about a quarter of the bag. I have ordered this product many times before and never had such a bad experience with quanity in the bag. I wrote to the co. and received NO RESPONSE from them.
0;"""I lived in New England for 26 years and have eaten more than my fair share of lobster bisque. It's one of my favorites.<br /><br />The stuff that came out of the can is very dark orange-colored which is not typical for lobster bisque"
0;I am a huge fan of lobster bisque so I thought I would give this a try. I did not have high expectation since it's canned but this is NOT edible! The soup is so nasty and taste nothing like lobster bisque. I tried adding cream but it didn't make it any better. I can't believe I paid $3.99/ can for this garbage!!
0;Forget the cheese sauce...the only way to use this product is to leave off the last step...they instruct you after cooking the product then to add the thick gooey cheese sauce which just ruins it....<br />I purchased a case of these...so before I cook them I add spices or herbs of choice and then after cooking I top with melted butter...I save the sauce packet for nachos..
0;Velveeta Au Gratin potatoes will surely change the way you think about little slimy potato chips. The poor quality of this food-type item makes me lose a little faith in this civilization and in the relationship between human animals and a free market economy.
0;If I had wanted a nutmeg muffin I would have made nutmeg muffins.  You can smell the nutmeg in the mix the second you cut open the bag.  If you're not a BIG fan of nutmeg you will want to pass on these.

0;This product is truly as awful as everyone says.  Wish I would have read these reviews before going to Walmart.  Now I've got a week full of twice daily washing to try and get this slime out of my hair and my hair will probably be drier and more brittle when I'm done than it ever was before I started!
0;I too was confused by the label and directions. The Clear Shea line in the gold bottles is intended for ethnic hair. Silver bottle line is for Caucasian type hair.  I too didnt know they had different product lines and thought this was a conditioner treatment but the #1 ingredient is petroleum jelly.  I have very curly dry hair but putting petroleum jelly on is not going to do anything forcme but make my hair look like I put petroleum jelly on it. I know this product has its purpose but it's not made for my hair type. I really can't see how this can nourish any human beings scalp. It's not the fancy ingredients it says it is. It's mostly petroleum jelly.
0;"""If you read all the reviews listed here you are going to find that there are NO instructions on how to use this product.  What a poor idea on the part of the manufacturer.  Give me a break!  To not tell customers the proper way to use your product to achieve the best results is stupid.  Various of these reviews list all the ways that those of us participating in the Amazon Vine program"
0;I have liked the other products by this company so I gave this a chance.My husband and daughters have dry scalp and I thought this might help. It's a good thing I got it free because it is going in the garbage after one try. I looked all over for directions on how to use this product I even searched online and found nothing so I shampooed and then tried to condition there scalps with this stuff. It was like putting peanut butter in their hair. It felt like vasalen. Once their hair dried it was an oily mess that wouldn't wash out. So if you like the oily look this is for you:} P>S another reviewer said Dawn will help take it out. Thank you it did help:}
0;"""I am not one to give a bad review for I like to find something good about a product. This has nothing good about it. It comes with no directions and I am not really sure what it is. The label says it is for scalp nourishment but I am not sure what that means. I opened up the jar to find a really buttery substance much like vasoline. I put a little on my scalp as I do have a problem with dry skin especially on my scalp but it was so greasy I could not stand it. BOY was I sorry"
0;Omg! Is anyone reading what's in this crap! Mineral oil and petroleum! Two no no's for heathy hair and scalp! What's wrong with these people? That shit clogs the pores on the scalp and hair follicle. Why would anyone looking to maintain hair health use this?
0;"""Warning!!! That's exactly what it should say on the jar....along with instructions on how to use it. This product is NOT for Caucasian hair....unfortunately I'm learning the hard way:-( I got this product as a hair masque that would help my dry scalp....WRONG....what it did do is leave me with the most heavy greasy hair"

0;The thing about the coffee is that it has no special taste to it that makes it the best in the world.  I bought this coffee after watching the bucket list.  Dont waste your money on this product it tastes horrible... in fact people in my office pitches in to buy it and they spit it out.  The taste was AWFUL!  For 50-90 bucks i would tell you to better spend your money on tank of gas or something.
0;"""I really liked how my hair looked at first when I tried this shampoo but by day 3 and 4 I started developing itchy bumps on my scalp.  I also realized that this product was leaving a film on my hair.  I had been using sulfate free shampoos for the last few years but I broke down and bought this because of all the great reviews.  This shampoo is not for everyone.  If you're at all sensitive to chemicals"

0;I'm sitting here munching on these and they are delicious. However I am giving one star because this price is more than double what you should be paying.

0;My dogs did not care much for these dog treats.  I have found my dogs have always liked all the Jones brand dog items in the past.  I will still get their other products but not the Chicken Taffy Dog Treats.
0;AMAZON ban this disgusting cruel rubbish now! These ducks suffered immense misery. They are force fed in crammed conditions for their livers to grow 10 times their natual size. I am apalled that you would supply this. I have always been a reliable customer and i will refuse to buy from you until you take this heartless pathetic idea of food off your website.
0;They are charging double what they should and with nearly $15 shipping on top of it. I love this brand of rice and came here hoping that I could find it cheaper than local but man this is expensive stuff.

0;"""I order a wide variety of items from Amazon constantly.  However until now I have never been disappointed.  Having purchased real mexican vanilla for the past 19 years in trips to the Caribbean I've been amazed by the Xel-Ha brand that I always get.  The vanilla smell is incredible and when used in ice cream and baked goods it provides the best vanilla taste I've ever experienced.  This year I did not get back with enough vanilla that I had intended to give family and friends.  When ordering a few more bottles I was concerned about getting bad or mediocre vanilla so I made sure to order from Amazon.  This Golden Pure vanilla has almost no vanilla smell ... just a  strong alcohol smell.  When used in cookies it provided no discernible vanilla taste. Also there is no information about whether it does or does not contain cumarin (a natural substance that would be dangerous for someone on blood thinner).  Now I understand that I am simply out $25+ as the vanilla apparentlycannot be returned.  I'm surprised and disappointed.<br /><br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474C7VU >Golden Pure Natural Mexican Vanilla"
0;I don't understand why a cracker called Multigrain has a strong Fennel flavor.  I wish I had read the reviews so I knew and I would not have purchased them.  We don't like fennel at our house so we don't like these crackers.

0;"""If you ask me i'd say that this is just a marketing plan to sell tap water- put a kid in the label and say its good for you- In my opinion it tastes manufactured and not natural. They aren't reinventing water in New York City!  You can tell by their site that its all about marketing"
0;"""I really wish I had read the other 1 star review before buying this.  I know it says 8lbs but when I saw that photo with the giant bag I expected to get that.  The 8lb bag can't fill up a bathtub.  That was the entire reason I bought these"
0;Thought this sounded like a great idea for my two little dogs....In fact such a good idea I purchased two packages--one for each dog. No way would my dogs touch them.  I even tried soaking in beef broth.  All attempts in vain. They would not try. A bad idea for this household.
0;"""These chews come in a wide range of sizes and thicknesses which means some chews will be easier to chew than some of the others.  I have a German Shepard/ Lab mix and she is now almost 4 and is a really strong chewer.  I really wanted this product to work because keeping my dogs teeth healthy and clean will help her living longer.  My dog choked on this so badly that she couldn't clear her own throat and luckily I was watching her to notice that she needed help.  I reached into her throat and pulled it out.  Stupidly"
0;"""I purchased this type of enzymatic chew to help control tartar build up on my dog's teeth.  I even verified that the additive Chlorhexdine is safe by contacting my Vet. I must say that my dog loved these chews  but they made her very ill for several days after just the first one.  She suffered from runny bowels and vomitting. The clean up alone was dreadful and so time consuming.  Of course"
0;Don't know what the difference between CET Hextra chew and CET Enzymatic chew but my dogs do not like the Hextra chew.  They will take the chew but only carry it around in the mouth.  They love the Enzymatic chew and  chew it until it disappears.
0;My 10 year old cat who was recently treated for a build up of tartar wouldn't touch these chews even when I cut them into small pieces and even when they were the only food available overnight. Next I guess I will have to try a toothbrush though I don't think he's going to like that either.
0;"""This seller by far is the only terrible seller I have dealt with from Amazon.<br />The Cat Chews arrived without any expiration date printed on the bags and most of them have changed to a very yellowy color. My two cats won't touch those with a off color. So"
0;Be aware that this product contains a form of sugar (dextrose) and is listed on the label as one of the main ingredients. To me this makes about as much sense as putting sugar in toothpaste. I love my cats. I'm definitely not feeding them something that can lead to tooth decay.
0;"""The fish C.E.T. chews smell terrible. I assumed they would but they are far worse than I expected. What's even worse is when the cats visit the litter box - O!M!G! I have to open all of the windows and doors"

0;I received my package with every piece of candy melted. The chocolate that did not melt to the wrapper crumbled once the wrapper was opened. I have ordered this product from another vendor in the past and had no issues with the candy melting. None of the candy could be eaten. I will not order from this vendor again.
0;Okay I only left 1 star for this item not due to it actually being bad but due to the fact that I was only able to use it once. I tried this for the first time yesterday morning in my coffee. I added 5 drops (recommended serving was 5-8 drops). I had an allergic reaction within a couple of minutes of taking literally a few sips of my coffee. The sips were small enough that you couldn't even tell I had any. It started that my hands got beyond itchy and felt like they were on fire and red. Then it went to my feet and my heart began racing and pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears as if I had just been running at full speed. Very scary feeling. I also broke out in hives and was very itchy for a few hours. Needless to say I am now stuck with a ton of this that I can not use plus the money.
0;Thought I would try it since it was supposed to make things taste great. Cannot get past the awful aftertaste. Will risk it and go back to Splenda. Wish i hadn't bought 2. If anybody wants to try my unopened bottle I will gladly give it away.
0;"""We moved our family from sugar about three years ago and had settled on Splenda as our sugar substitue.  We use it to sweeten Lipton iced tea which we make in one-gallon containers.  We'd love to move to a sweetner that is all natural and thought this might work.  Yuck! is all I can say for the taste.  We've used about half of one of the bottles and Yuck is the feedback from our entire family and extended family.  The taste starts off kind of sweet but has a really weird aftertaste that just ruins it all.  I haven't tried it in anything else but this will simply not work for us.  We have tried Truvia and it is almost a perfect substitute taste wise"
0;I purchased two types of stevia to try to move from using artificial sweetener to stevia. I read recommendations for this product so I decided we would try it. This really has a strong aftertaste of alcohol and chemicals. (I was disappointed because we had two bottles of the stuff. My bad.) I threw it out because no one would eat the food that it touched.<br /><br />FYI - I prefer the Stevita Stevia Supreme because there is no aftertaste with it.  I wish it was in liquid form too because that would be helpful.
0;"""NOTICE TO ANY PRESCRIPTION DRUG PATIENTS ... it is not clear on most liquid stevia products how many of them (this one included) utilize  grapefruit seed extract  as an additive (typically as a natural preservative).

0;I purchased two bottles at the beginning of June and when they arrived both contained clear liquid. We started using one bottle and just recently noticed there was fluffy foreign material in the bottom of the bottle. I checked the unopened bottle and found the same foreign material at the bottom. It appears the product must have been contaminated during the manufacturing process with some type of bacteria. Contacted the manufacturer and will put a report in to the FDA to ensure the manufacturer recalls the lot. LOT # 120374 Best By 03/14.
0;"""I hadn't eaten  instant noodles  in years and the TV commercials were enticing. Too enticing.  Some nutrition data would sure be useful on the Amazon screen.  Half the package is 250 calories so if you eat the whole thing you're in Big Mac territory.  The sodium content is off the chart for most of us and is the dominant flavor. It requires two flavor packet additions at different times during preparation. The final product just doesn't taste very good. After preparing one package I ditched the rest in the trash.  If possible"
0;These are kind of bland but the serving size is sufficient and it is a cheap warm meal that only requires adding water and microwaving. I try to avoid eating meat and to my knowledge this is a vegetarian dish.<br /><br />Sodium soup is what we call it.
0;"""The product was shipped in a timely manner but the packing used to ship the product was inadequate. One of the bottle caps arrived broken and the contents spilled over the remaining products. This made for quite a mess and a lot of dissatisfaction. To add insult to injury"
0;This was advertised as sugar free.  It definitely is n ot as it has 16 grams of sugar.  Would not recommend it for anyone on sugarfree diet.  False advertising If I would have known it had that m uch sugar I would not have bought it.
0;"""I purchase a lot of products from Amazon. This is the first time I wanted to return an item and these are not returnable. The product is not sampling of the flavors but appears to be a box of all the flavors they couldn't sell individually. There are so many multiples of flavors I would never use (ie: 4 cinnamon"
0;It doesn't have a butter flavor.<br /><br />It doesn't have much of a salt flavor either.<br /><br />So. It doesn't taste like butter and you need to add salt. The only thing it has going for it is that it is gluten free.<br /><br />The subscribe and save price is good. Better than you can get at the store by quite a bit. I bought my single bottle at the big box store for about 2.78 so if you can get it for less with S&S then it is a good deal price wise.<br /><br />Be sure you buy a single one at the store before you invest in a 6 pack.
0;"""I received a package of Bob's Extra Thick Rolled Oats -- not what I ordered and not what was pictured on the seller's page.  This one is made in a facility that processes wheat.  It has a little sticker attached (covering the bar code) that includes the words  Gluten Free "
0;Never thought it would be possible to have bad cotton candy...until now. Unsure if its expired or what but it tasted and smells like badly burned marshmallows so it was not edible and I wound up throwing it away. Very disappointing.
0;"""I originally searched for TONE'S or WEBER Canadian steak seasoning.<br />I used these brands for years as a table seasoning in lieu of salt as I<br />am a heart patient and am limited in salt intake.  These filled the bill!<br />When these items could not be found or were discontinued"
0;These mints are hard to find and I was excited to see that they offered them on Amazon but they were hard as a rock. I particularly like these mints from Necco because they are usually pretty soft but now I have 11 unopened packages of non returnable crappy mints and a 12th opened bag that took out one of my teeth
0;I suffer from dry mouth and usually have a hard candy in my mouth.  In an effort to cut down on my sugar intake I tried the Crystal Light hard candy in Pomegranate flavor.  I found this product to be nearly completely lacking in any flavor at all.  It has the taste extremely watered down lemonade. Don't waste your time on this product. There are others products out there that taste great.

0;"""I reviewed these 5lb mini gummy frogs right after I received them about a month ago. It wasn't a favorable review either. I can't believe the last post on this product was over 6 months ago (Sept. 2010). They probably had 6 months of bad reviews...anyway"
0;"""As a kid i absolutely loved the green frogs and when i saw these on sale i jumped on the deal.  Much to my disappointment i am not able to actually taste these because they are so stale.  I might as well have bought a bag of pebbles... I guess that will teach me to buy candy online"
0;The amount of wasabi in these things made me choke and tear up. The wasabi dust gets into the nostrils and is quite irritating. Perhaps these would be edible if you could clean them off a bit first. Made in China.

It just burned.  And I tried 2 boxes before I threw everything out.  No more Orville for me. Back to Pop Secret.  Nice idea"

I was going to use it for her to drink in her bottle. I mixed the milk with equal parts water and put it in her bottle. She absolutely hated the taste!!  I tried adding liquid goats milk to the bottle"
0;I tried this product and it had the most horrible taste. I really thought it would taste nice. This is the first time I have ever tasted Goat milk though. Very strong taste.  My advice is buy one can and see if you like it first. I have extra goat milk that I or my family will not drink. I plan to use it in making homemade soap so that I get some use from it.

We took her to the vet who immediately said no more food or treats from China and sent us to a specialist who tested her for just about everything (very uncomfortable for her"
0;Bought at Costco but just recently came across an article about Waggin Train products where dogs have died or become seriously ill. Grateful that I had other treats and my dogs did not get alot of these...bag going in the garbage ASAP as I'd rather lose my money than my dogs.<br /><br />I won't buy any dog products made in china anymore considering their lack of environmental rules/laws and care and their attitudes towards dogs in general (they don't value dogs so why would they take care that the treats are not toxic?)<br /><br />Would not recommend.
0;This brand has been proven to make dogs sick. Some have died! There are NO health regulations for pet products and these are made in China. These are my dog's favorite bones but I've had to find others.
0;By reading the other reviews of this soup I was expecting something amazing. It was just ok. Not very flavorful at all. I thought I was ordering Hot and Sour soup. It wasn't hot. It wasn't sour. It tasted like chicken stock and not much else. I wouldn't recommend it.
0;I sent this as a gift and should have known the price was too good to be true. It turned out to be a basket full of cardboard packaging with very little food products. I had to send another gift to make up for this overpriced basket of cardboard.
0;the basket i ended up getting did NOT have the smoked almonds that the product mentioned plus when it came out of packaging most of the stuff was sticking together. Not impressed with product and will not get this again. so getting this from the cyber week deal for 42 dollars is NOT a good deal.

0;"""I thought I was ordering candied lemon peels that can be eaten on their own. These are horrible for that purpose. I just read another review that said you can bake it into things and put them in coffee. That sounds like a bad idea"
0;"""My review has nothing to do with the company shipping since that was ok. I have never tried chestnuts and these roasted and peeled (as advertised) nuts appealed to me. I thought these would be crunchy since it said roasted. These were like boiled peanuts ... mushy. The title should say boiled and peeled. I personally do not like boiled peanuts but if you do then this might be a good purchase. I will stick with the almonds"
0;I am very disappointed in the quality of the teas in that lovely box.  They all taste the same!  I had never heard of Bentley Tea and don't expect to again.  Now what do I do with 120 teabags that have no flavor?<br />The box will make a nice jewelry container when I'm done.

0;"""I cannot stand the taste of this  cinnamon . It doesn't list the kind of cinnamon used on its packaging so I question it's true origins. I like to put cinnamon in my tea every morning but this brand is not usable.

I won't be purchasing from this vendor ever again."""
0;"""It is not a good sign when you open your door and smell olive juice from a wet package three feet away.  The bucket was broken and ALL of the olive juice was drained away.

0;I can honestly say with sixty years on this earth these are by far the worst peppermint anything I have ever tasted to include a two year old stale peppermint candy cane a few years back. An absolute disgusting flavor appeal with a horrendous bad aftertaste. Don't waste your money. I did save the plastic containers to utilize after I tossed the regurgitated dog dung inside!
0;This product was sent in 105+ degree weather without being packed with any type of coolant to keep it from melting.  All 12 boxes were melted and the outside package was even greasy from the melted candy.  Not one piece escaped from melting.  I was so disappointed.  I can not believe it was mailed this way.  What a waste of my money.  I will not be ordering through you again unless you would want to make it good.  I will send the product back to you in the same shape I received it if you would like a box of melted mess.

I wished a many times that I had only ordered one box of them. Instead I ordered a case of them which is 6 boxes for I didn't see how they would last very long"
0;I can see why these were once banned.  They taste awful.  I loved them as a kid.  No more.  Number one is the fact there is no warning about the incredible amount of sodium in this drink.  No one over 35 or 40 could drink this.  Not good for the little ones either.  They do not dissolve unless you use hot water first.  Then of course they taste awful.  The postage is a rip off.  A terrible product and a terrible price.
0;"""One of the worst things I have ever tasyed that was supose to be drinkable. Under fizzed and over chemicalled. My Grand children tasted it and got sick. Nothing like the real  Fizzies  of old. Reccogmended only for suicides to hide the taste of the poison-naw it might make you throw up and screw up the suicide attempt. They only sell it in large quantities because after tasting one no one would ever buy a second one."""
0;The bowling pin candy was marked with an expiration date of March 2011. As soon as we handed them out at the birthday party one child noticed the expiration date. By then it was too late to do much about the problem. Another child said he did not like the lollipops. Maybe if they were fresh he might have. The bowling ball candy did not have an expiration date on the wrapper so there was not any way to know how old that was. I noticed one positive review above. I think the lollipops worked out in that instance because the children could not read.
0;These were once the best turkish pistachios! NO LONGER. My order this week was awful. Unsalted-even though the bag said salted. Tasted like boring unsalted California pistachios. Last time I order from Superior Nut.
0;Do not waste your money on this basket. All 5 items are sample size and I estimate it cost maybe $10 to put together. Not only that but the offerings are obscure items and too variable for average tastes. What a disappointment....
0;Why in gods name are they selling stale food from this place. The expiration date is for dec 09 but yet there stale. The people that make these maybe changed the dates so they could sell them?

0;I am so upset. This stuff is useless unless you want any color other than yellow. The blue is not blue. You can only use it to make multi shades of grey.

0;I purchased this bone for my 6 month old black lab and he loved it when I gave it to him.  Kept him busy for a long while but did I pay for that the next day.  He had DIARHEA that was pure water.  I will not be buying this type of bone again.  I should have read all the reviews before I purchased it and then I would have known better.
0;This bone made my dog very sick.  She is a Greater Swiss Mountain dog and although she enjoyed the bone it gave her terrible diarrhea.  Make sure you monitor you dog if you buy this.  I will not be buying again.
0;"""I bought this from Whole Foods along with the Irish Cream flavor and neither of them had much flavor at all.  They both tasted like very watered down sugar water and took a quarter of the bottle in a single cup of coffee to taste it and even then it was faint.  While I appreciate that it is organic"
0;"""I too stopped feeding Evanger's to my German Shepherd. I do not trust their products because the owners have done some very dishonest things. The company can say whatever they want but I personally feel that if a person is dishonest in one area of their life"
0;"""I bought this because it was labelled organic without really reading the label. My mistake. It is from concentrate and has  natural flavors  added. Why on earth would coconut water that is fresh need flavoring added? (and just because it is called natural flavors"
0;"""Very disingenuous label and marketing.  It's reconstituted from concentrate and has  natural flavoring  (not labeled as organic btw) which can be anything including MSG.<br /><br />Don't bother with this poser."""
0;"""I just bought this product... I drink a lot of coconut water... The last thing I want is a coconut water from concentrate with  natural flavors  added... I would have contacted the company directly but could not find the contact info. I know natural flavors give the flavor of fresh ... to something that isn't fresh... It's odd that they go out of their way to have it labeled organic since it has been altered... Not what people who buy organic are looking for... This company should change this product because consumers are waking up and want real quality now"""
0;I just received the Miss Vickie's Variety Pack of 30 today and on the bag it says to sell by Sep 25th. Now I though that the sell by date was Sep 25th 2013 not Sep 25th 2012. I tried a bag just to see and the chips tasted like their really close to their expiration date. They tasted like their about to go stale. I tried a different flavor just to double check and though it tasted alittle better it was also tasted like it was close to its expiration date. I gave it to some friends to try because taste is a personal preference. They told me that it didn't taste as fresh and was alittle stale. A friend referred me to this brand of chips. So I decided to try it out. Since I can't purchase this in stores where I live. I decided to just order it in bulk online. This way I can pack a bag of chips for lunch everyday for a month. Now I regret it. Now I only have 8 days to finish 30 bags of chips. How am I suppose to do that? Unless I want to become morbidly obese<br /><br />I essentially just paid $25 for a box of chips with a shelf life of 8 days. This is unacceptable. Stay away from this vendor and purchase it from a store if you can.
0;Tea described as Pure Ceylon Tea. They forgot to write that it flavored!!<br />The flavor is terrible. It kills the taste of the tea totally!! I am not even sure there is any of real Ceylon Tea.<br />Can't drink it -  was thrown out :(
0;"""I bought these from another vendor and spent $22.00 which was a waste of money.  They DO NOT TASTE ANYTHING LIKE THE OLD DELFA ROLLS.  I am 49 years old and ought to know what they tasted like.  Don't waste your money"
0;"""I was horribly disappointed when i received these. Wasnt till after the fact i saw there  new and improved flavor  blurb somewhere. WTF . . . . why bother bringing them back if they are completely different? Save your money if you are expecting them to be anywhere near the original Delfa Rolls. I ordered a case and was one of the first to get them when they came out"
0;"""I purchased this to give as part of our company gift to a coworker who was getting married.  I paid over $80 - $52 for the gift and $30 for overnight shipping.  WHAT A WASTE!!!  The product is certainly not as advertised.  The basket is so tiny"
0;Bought this for my one year annivsary and was trying to guve it the benifit of the doubt. please dont make the same mistake. does not come with what is listed and i evwn went to main site so falsly shown. Stay away!!! Thank god amazon kicks butt i got a full refund.
0;"""The  Art of Appreciation That's Amore! Romantic Dinner For Two - Italian Gourmet Food Gift Basket  was a basketful of bunk.  I have been 100% happy with everything I've ever ordered from Amazon until this debacle:<br /><br />1. They sent the  gift  basket to my address (billing)"
0;"""This item is a gyp and the seller produces false advertising. I received this item today and its horrible.  I paid $30 for this? The tins of tea appear larger in the add. This set will make about 8 cups of tea (for $30). The packaging is not the same and it is NOT a GIFT set.  Basically"
0;I purchased this product because I am diabetic and am always looking for new sugar free items to try.  I just wanted to let everyone know that I do not like your product at all.  I hate it that I spent that much money for something that I just had to throw in the trash.  I have bought General Foods International swiss mocha and love it.  Guess I'll have to go back to drinking it.
0;I should have listened to the negative reviews for this product. I am diabetic and was hoping for a pleasing cappuccino for a treat. Taste is absolutely horrible. So sorry I ordered a case of this. I'll never use it.
0;I am so disappointed that the company switched last July from using sucralose (splenda) as the sweetener to aspartame!  Yuck!!!  I loved this tea and drank it all day.  NO MORE!!!  I have no idea why a company would switch like that and I hope they change it back!
0;This gum and its very pink color ended up costing me $549.00 In dental work.  It turned the front tooth pink and the dentist worked on it for 2 hours first getting the pink out of the tooth then working on the material that he had to use to fill the tooth back in to return it to it's orginal color.  The was no cavity and brushing was done.  Just be careful unless you don't mind the dental bill.
0;"""Oh boy! It's Reese's Peanut Butter... in a jar!? Well golly gee willikers - sign me up!<br /><br />Pretty much the only people buying this item are people who like Reese's and believe deep down that a naked Reese's cup is a happy Reese's cup. Why go and sully such delicious peanut butter by covering it in milk"
0;There were something like 6 marshmallows in the packet along with some bitter cocoa.  The product was nothing like the product statement on the outside of the box.  Too expensive!  Will not purchase again!!
0;This Product came with outter plastic cover removed with only 29 bars of candy in a 30 bar pack. Also came melted and reharded. (Not sure if that happend in shipping or came that way) But unsure of eating cause package came opened. *I did not make any claim since it was so cheap.
0;I purchased the Egg-Streme Soccer: Easter Gift Basket for Boys - Ages 6 to 9 Years Old<br />for my nephew for easter.  I was very disappointed when it arrived in a very tiny box. It looks nothing like the picture and has very few items in it.  I have to go out and buy a bigger basket and add more things to it so I don't look like a cheap skate.  I won't buy from this company again.
0;I typically love the taste of Steaz products so I was excited to give this one a go when I saw it at the store. Unfortunately it bears absolutely no taste resemblance to any half and half I've ever had anywhere. The only flavors I get are of the stevia along with some unidentified citrus taste.<br /><br />This one falls far from typical Steaz products. I suggest staying away until they can come up with an improved formula that actually tastes anything like half and half.
0;"""I tested the pH of this water. I am very disappointed because it's far from the generous promise. The pH barely reaches 8 and is not any different from the spring water I receive from a water delivery service.<br /><br />Don't be fooled. Promise is not kept. Or"
0;"""I tested the pH of this water with reliable testing strips and it tested at 6.25 :\<br /><br />Used these:<br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PDB79W >Phinex Diagnostic Ph Test Strips"
0;"""Tested this water with reliable pH testing strips and came up with a reading of 6.25  :/<br /><br />strips used: <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PDB79W >Phinex Diagnostic Ph Test Strips"
0;You would seriously have to be desperate and living in an area of the planet that does not have Pepsi because this price makes me laugh.<br /><br />Don't be a sucker. PLEASE. Don't buy this Pepsi from this vendor.
0;"""I bought a 24 can case of these and will never do it again. I should have heeded others reviews but I thought  I'm not that finicky . You don't have to be finicky to disapprove of these. (1) They've got a stringy thing hanging off of them. (2) They are small (3) If they haven't fallen apart by the time you open the can"
0;"""The important issue is that they are made in China. Remember the pet food from China that poisoned American dogs and cats in 2007. Remember also poisoned milk that killed Chinese babies in 2008. I'd rather buy food from another source with a better track record.<br />Unfortunately"
0;These used to be the best tart cherries I had ever tried and I purchased dozens of bags for pies and for snacking.  They switched to a different source for their cherries and the flavor went south.  The last 3 bags I tried over 6 months were all bad.  This is too bad.  They had a great product.
0;"""I purchased this oil for sauteeing. It worked great at first but when I got to the middle of the jar I found a plastic film that is apparently mixed in with the oil. I will no longer be using this for cooking"
0;tastes like a failed willy wonka experiment from the 80s made when the oompa loompas went on strike then repackaged as this salad dressing because to dump the vats of this syruppy concoction would be tantamount to the worst environmental tragedy in history. tastes like diabetes wrapped in a coma surrounded by a diabetic coma lying sideways in fanta strawberry soda if it got up and walked onto your otherwise perfect salad and grimaced at you.
0;"""Received this today. It was not good at all. Maybe I was just spoiled by another online company who specialized in dried fruits and nuts. I had only had their dried strawberries before. Their strawberries were accual strawberry size and excellants taste. These just a little larger than a raisin and don't taste very good. They took the rotten strawberries from the patch to make these. I will have to use them in salads"
0;They need a black box warning on these. They are super super addictive if you suffer from Iron deficit issues. Some people have went to extremes of eating 10 boxes (tins) a day.<br /><br />They taste fine but the addiction can ruin you.
0;"""Bought this at a boutique market in So Cal.  I did so because the label said it was sweet.  I don't know if it was on the shelf too long (as with alot of products in these boutiquey low volume markets)"
0;"""I like <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00161DVFS >Tony Chachere's More Spice Creole Seasoning - 7 oz.</a> and so gave this a try.  It's has a very salt-like taste due to the KCl (potassium chloride) used instead of NaCl (sodium chloride"
0;"""I had this meal at an airport because I didn't want to pay $11 for a sandwich.  I paid $6 for this in a shop and it was not very good.  The tuna was the worst quality tuna available.  The nuts were stale (probably been there too long.) Couldn't find a freshness date.  I had to eat it because I bought it and didn't have time to go back for a refund"
0;"""What a nightmare. I received a couple samples of the Cafe Escapes Cafe Caramel K-Cups direct from the manufacturer and I was so excited to try them. I use my Keurig everyday and routinely clean the thing. I put in the first cup this morning and it made the regular noise"
0;I ordered 6 of the 16+ honey.  I got 5.  One bottle of 12+ was substituted without any reduction in price.  The order was so poorly packed that the box collapsed and pressure was put on the plastic bottles of honey.  As a result the seals of 2 of the bottles were breached and several tablespoons of honey from each were leaked out inside the box.  WHAT A MESS!  I'll not order any more.
0;"""I've been using this brand for a long time and loved it always. But two of them I ordered came yesterday( Batch # 000013 )tasted terribly wrong. They are not the same taste as I previously ordered. I tasted they are contaminated"
0;"""I knew nothing about Manuka honey but wanted to see what it would do about a burn on my hand so I bought a jar from Whole Foods that had no name on the label but on the side it said  packed by Arataki for Pacific Resources International.  It did improve my burn very much and I was sold! So I read up about Manuka honey and went and bought Wedderspoon 16+. It was LESS effective than the non-name 5+ jar. However"
0;"""Mo Hotta Mo Betta is a company you cannot count on.  I will soon be receiving my Christmas present (one month late????) The company was out of stock and could not meet the order.  They must be hard up for money"
0;"""There aren't many ingredients in here but almost all of them would ban it from any natural grocery store and calling it all-natural is actually not legal. Whole Foods has ingredients in this on its banned product list....no"
0;I received this product and eagerly offered the dog the first biscuit out of the box.  She stepped back and walked away without hesitating.  I smelled the biscuit and it had a rancid peanut butter smell to it.  I checked the other 9 in the box and they all smelled the same...bad.  What a shame since we had purchased these previously and the dog enjoyed them.  I won't be purchasing anymore online and will stay with the local pet store for fresh treats.
0;My 2 year old adores these crackers.  I recently was very ill and could not get to the store to buy them for her so I purchased them from a My Favorite Things through amazon.  Since the price was $8 and because the picture looks like a big box of crackers I assumed I was in fact buying a big box of crackers.  Wrong!  They were selling a little bag for $8 + $5 shipping.  When I contacted the seller to complain they were unwilling to do anything for me.  Thankfully Amazon stepped in but really I think they should ban this seller from their site.  Talk about price gouging!
0;It's no wonder they had to break up this little cup of soup into 2 (TWO) entire servings. They are obviously trying to distract the casual viewer into to believing that there is only 300 mg of sodium in this tiny cup. There is actualy 600 mg of sodium in this tiny snack and that is NOT HEART HEALTHY!!! Avoid these products if you have high blood pressure!
